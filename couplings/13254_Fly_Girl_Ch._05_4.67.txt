 Fly Girl V: Base-to-Final

By PygmyCoho



Agent Al Scott murmured to his partner, "So, this is somethin', huh?"

Agent Wayne Little answered, "Yep. Makes a fellow feel kind of important." He chuckled.

The quiet offices of the Sheriff had taken on a bustling life with extra personnel assigned to run down leads. Two of the more promising tips led to areas of interest, one of which was on the list that Tom provided. Al's instincts told him to go with that one.

"How sure are you about this Tom guy, Al?"

"Got a pretty good feeling about him."

"Anything to do with him and your cousin?" Wayne picked up his long-cold sub sandwich, decided against it and tossed the remnants into the trash.

"I thought 'bout that. Thought hard, too. Even allowing for some favoritism, I still like his pick better. Why? You wanna bail on me?"

"Nah, just checking your gut. I'll stick with you. But . . ."

"But?"

"If you're wrong the drinks are on you. For the whole night."

"More like tomorrow night, or the next, with all the paperwork. That's if we even go today. It's getting kind of late."

"Yeah," Wayne admitted. "Either way it goes, paper up the wazoo, huh? Okay so two nights after the deal goes down?"

"Okay. Uh, you, or the squad?" His smile faded as the older agent appeared to give the question such serious consideration. Al's brain kept increasing the bar tab as time dragged.

"Ha! Gotcha. Just me." Wayne grinned.

"Okay," Al sighed, relief on his face. "And if I'm right?"

"Same bet," Wayne offered.

"Except," Al stated, "you need to let me invite the civvies."

"That's what, another two, right?"

"Yeah . . . no, four," Al confirmed. "You up for that?"

"If I get to invite four, too."

"Deal," Al said, extending a hand. They shook.

"Hey," Wayne thought out loud, "What if neither one hits?"

Al shrugged and turned back to his computer. He did not want to think about a shut-out.
