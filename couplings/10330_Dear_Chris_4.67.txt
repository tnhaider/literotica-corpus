  Dear Readers,

This is a story of a relationship that builds slowly, over a long period of time, with lots of complicated feelings from D.J.'s side. 

Part of what makes D.J. like Chris so much is her ability to just be herself with him, and let out a part of her nature she can't anywhere else. Part of what makes D.J. so attractive to Chris is her incredible ability to weave a realistic, interesting story that makes him feel like he's watching it take place, like he's right there.

This chapter is about the start of their time together, and the interesting stories that D.J. weaves that capture his interest, and maybe one day, his heart.

  To N.C., and William H.

This one's for you.

I love hearing from fans, but there was one whose accolades were more specific, encouragement more inspiring. After a while I wanted to reach out and say something to him or her specifically. I decided to put up a post.

It's easy for me to think of characters for my fiction. It's much harder to do anything real, especially nowadays. I bit my bottom lip as I tried to think of what to write, and I came up with a draft.
