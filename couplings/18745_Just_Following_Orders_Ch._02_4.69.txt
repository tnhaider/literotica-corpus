 Master Sergeant Andrew Thomas had been giving a lot of thought to what had happened between him and Lieutenant Colonel Debra Robinson the previous Friday. He was a soldier's soldier, one of those troops who just naturally lived the Army's values of loyalty, duty, respect, selfless service, honor, integrity, and personal courage daily; what had occurred was a violation of at least half of those values in addition to being a violation of several sections of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, or UCMJ. He knew all that, but for some reason it really didn't bother him.

It was easy enough to rationalize. First of all, she was hotter than hot, a true beauty with a fabulous body. He was if nothing else a normal, red-blooded male, in excellent physical shape and not bad looking to boot. They were about the same age, thirty-six, and looked like people who belonged together.

Second, she had initiated everything, and as the senior member of this pair she stood to get into a lot more trouble than him if it ever came out publicly. 

Third, as much as the military might deny it, this shit went on all the time. Fraternization between officer and enlisted was technically banned, but even military law and policy took into consideration the fact that it did occur. Military members of different ranks could be married to each other but not in the same chain of command, and in many cases one would have to leave the service. But the illicit, secret relationships also happened a lot, including with flag officers and those below them, and it even happened in war zones. It was rarely prosecuted unless there was risk of a security breach or some other party was harmed, like a spouse who found out.

So Andy wasn't as bothered by it as one might expect. He was five years from retirement and could easily get through that time as long as they were careful, and he chuckled when he reflected on Debra's oral abilities. She gave a world-class blowjob.
