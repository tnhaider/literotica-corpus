 By the time they became lovers, they had known each other for years, although they had only recently begun to explore each other on a personal level.

Their first tryst was at a hotel, in an upper floor room with moonlight streaming in the window. The room was large and tastefully furnished, and with a childlike abandon he'd never seen in her, she kicked her shoes across the room and belly-flopped into the middle of the king-sized bed.

"Oh. My. Gawd," came the muffled southern drawl. "It's actually comfortable."

He grinned as he stepped out of his shoes and sat down beside her. She rolled to her side to face him.

"I've always loved a big playground." She shifted closer to him and asked, "What do you want right now?"

"I want to see all of you."

She stood beside the bed and dropped her jeans to the floor. When she pulled the t-shirt over her head, he was standing in front of her. He unclasped her bra and slid it off her shoulders.

The kiss was deep and intense, and the warmth of his hands on her bare breasts - teasing and pinching her nipples - sent tingles of pleasure through her pussy. She felt familiar dampness in her panties.

Still locked in the kiss, she tugged at his shirt, wanting to feel his bare skin against hers. He broke away long enough to give her what she desired, and then bent to kiss her again, feeling her nipples stiff against his bare chest as he cupped her ass in his hands and pulled her body to him.

She felt his cock hard against her belly and ground herself against him. His fingers slipped inside her panties.

"Wait," she whispered, as she eased his zipper down. Then, she slowly knelt at his feet, took his cock in her mouth, and looked up into his eyes. He groaned his pleasure as she licked and sucked.

He twined his fingers in her hair and began to fuck her mouth. **************** He was definitely her type. She firmly believed that everyone had a "type" - the one that made you look twice, and wonder.

Her type was a man with dark hair and a heavy beard, whether he chose to wear one or not. The feeling of day-old stubble on her breasts and between her thighs gave her a rush like the ones she got in her younger, pot-smoking years.

Taller was better, but height wasn't the ultimate attraction for her. The man had to carry himself with confidence. Tentative men - and women, for that matter - just left her cold.

They met for the first time in their respective jobs, on opposite sides of the table. To her delight, he wasn't afraid to go on the attack to win a point. She knew why he did it - to show her he could match her own level of confidence, and raise the stakes. His gaze never faltered. Nor did hers.

She was intrigued. 

Over the years, they had increasing contact as they worked on common issues, and developed a mutual respect, even when they disagreed. After all, it was a job, and they were professionals. He was always professional, respectful and courteous. 

He seemed at first to be amused by the passion she had for her side of the work, but later began to expect nothing less. There were even times when he encouraged her.

Almost always off the record. ************** From the moment she tasted the hard warmth of his cock, the satiny head grazing her lips as she opened her mouth to take him in, she entered a world of erotic bliss. She took him as deeply into her mouth as she could, and then backed off, teasing him with her tongue as her hand continued to stroke his shaft. When she stole a glance upward, she saw his eyes were closed. His hand gripped her hair more tightly and he fucked his cock faster into her hot mouth.

She felt his balls tighten, and knew he was close.

His question was a throaty groan. "Do you want me to cum?"

"Um hmm," she moaned.

She swallowed almost as fast as the warm spurts of cum erupted. He moaned aloud now, and with each one, she felt her swollen clit throbbing, slick with her own juices.

His hand left her hair as he sat down on the edge of the bed. She stood, kissing his neck and sucking his nipples as she moved downward to take his cock in her mouth again.

"Wait," he whispered. "I want to taste you now." *************** After a few years, their jobs allowed them to enter into a less adversarial, and more collaborative relationship. Some of those collaborations were, by mutual agreement, off the record. All of them were successful.

So were the after-hours meetings. They each felt freer to express themselves honestly with the understanding that nothing would be repeated. 

He discovered another side of her – one that wasn't as intense as her public persona.

Through the years, she had fleetingly wondered what he was like outside of work. Now, those thoughts turned to wondering what he was like in bed.

One night, they talked about it. About how – or whether – a sexual relationship could work. Both of them were concerned about their work interfering with their fun. He was more cautious than she was.

As far as she was concerned, anything personal between them would have to be separate from their jobs. She knew she could do that, because she had before.

Her professional life might be very public, but her personal life was off the record. **************** She lay back on the bed as he explored her with his hands, lips and teeth, listening for the quickening of breath that told him he'd hit a sweet spot. He slid her panties down and tossed them on the floor.

He didn't say a word as he fingered her pussy. She was already so wet. He felt the physical rush of realization - sucking his cock had turned her on. 

Stroking her clit with his thumb, he looked up at her face. Her eyes were closed. She arched her back slightly, forcing his fingers deeper into her pussy as she caressed her breasts, fingers tweaking her nipples.

"Oh, yes. Harder, baby."

He rubbed her clit harder, and was rewarded with a gasp of pleasure as her eyes flew open.

"Oh, gawd yes. Yes."

He bent and inhaled her scent. Still fucking her with his fingers, he sucked her swollen clit into his mouth, and his tongue teased her with rapid flicks. As he felt her hand cradle his head, he knew she was close. His cock stiffened with each of her moans.

She felt her pussy tightening on his fingers. "Oh now, baby...now!"

Her world exploded in a rush of sensation, wave after incredible wave radiating from her pussy and resonating deep into her belly. She moaned aloud, and grabbed his shoulders, wordlessly pulling him up toward her.

Instinctively, he knew what she wanted. She wanted to feel his cock inside her while her orgasm still rippled through her body.

As he plunged into her velvet depth with slow, steady strokes, she whispered into his mouth. "Baby, fuck me deep."

He thrust deeper into her tight heat and her hips rose to meet him with each stroke. She grabbed his ass with both hands, urging him on. She tightened her pussy around his shaft and arched her back, hair splayed over the pillow beneath her. 

He began cumming as soon as he felt the walls of her pussy milking his cock. His throaty moans mingled with her cries of delight and he continued to stroke as long as he could before he stopped, pulling her close to him as he rolled onto his side with his cock still twitching, buried inside her. ***************** Afterword, she nestled next to him, listening to his heartbeat as it gradually slowed. Together, they shifted slightly until they found companionable comfort.

"Question," she said.

"Answer," came his sleepy reply.

"Will you still respect me in the morning?"

His laughter rang out, filling the room.

With a satisfied smile, she settled next to him again.

"Good night."

"Damn good night," he replied.

They slept, each one thinking of the next rendezvous.

Which would be – of course – off the record.
