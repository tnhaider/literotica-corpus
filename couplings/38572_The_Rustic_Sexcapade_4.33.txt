 This is purely a work of fiction.

Vidya:

The entire village was abuzz with the arrival of a new dame, married to the village chieftains son Prakash. Prakash was a young and dashing son of the most progressive village chieftain. Not only was he educated in the neighbouring town and had completed graduation but also married the lady of his choice which was approved by the chief, which in nearby villages was unheard of. The lady that Prakash had chosen to be his lawfully wedded wife, Vidya, was studying in his college and belonged to an affluent family. She was drop dead gorgeous. Though not very fair, she made up for it with her immaculate curves and well blessed assets. This is what was being discussed not only by the village rowdies but also by the belles seething with jealously. 

Although it was a picture perfect match between families of the same class in terms of standard of living and affluence. There were some idealogical differences which had to be ironed out through compromises. The chieftain wanted Prakash and Vidya to reside in the village and look after the agri-based family business. However, the newly wedded couple wanted to stay in the town at least for the first few years. Much to the bride's chagrin, it was settled that they would settle in a village though in a separate smaller house. 

But this story is not about Prakash and Vidya, it is about Manoj. 

Manoj:

Manoj was a 50yr old, potbellied dark and bald, potter and craftsman who used to stay next to the newly married couple. Though once a part of a flourishing family, Manoj was the sole custodian of dying art having been abandoned by his immediate family including his wife. Manoj spent his days practising his art and reminiscing the past days of glory. Though he was not a simpleton, he did not have any addictions and his carnal desires had dried up with his wealth and desertion of his family. However, the sight of his new neighbour had aroused something in Manoj that he could not correctly place in the spectrum of his feelings. But whatever it was, he felt happy to see her around. 

Vidya:

After settling in her new humble residence, Vidya had commenced her domestic life and professional life by joining as a teacher in the neighbouring village's school. Though the rustic life was uninteresting, the predictability it offered was comforting. The entire day proceeded like clockwork - morning chores, the work, the evening cooking and the late night copulation. All of it had a set cadence had satiated Vidya and made her drop her guard unaware that her actions were being observed from a distance.

The harvest season was soon arriving with departing showers. The weather that day was an anti-climax for that time of the year. What usually is a bright sunny day turned in to a dull gloomy one. And fearing for the damage to the ripened crops all the men rushed to their farms to salvage whatever they could. By evening it started raining cats and dogs. A worried Vidya stayed back in school waiting for it to subside cursing herself for not carrying an umbrella. Around early evening she decided it wasn't going to stop raining and she might as well try her luck out there rather than waiting in the school. While she was about to step out, Prakash called her saying he will be spending the night on the farm with all the others. If there was anything that would have annoyed her, it was that. She stepped out into the rain and was drenched to the bone within few steps. 

Manoj:

It was getting unusually dark for that time of the day! With the twilight just the horizon, Manoj was anxiously waiting for his daily dose of visual entitlement. He longed everyday to watch Vidya walk across his house towards her. The way her hips swayed with each step made those long forgotten emotions stir. Today was not different. The patter of rain was fuelling his anxiety. The darkness was engulfing the sky with each passing moment and with that his hope of watching her pass by was also diminishing. He convinced himself that she might spend the night with her in-laws and that he will have to wait another day, but somehow his heart wasn't convinced. Every few seconds his eyes would dart back to the lane that she traversed daily. Finally after a long wait he could finally see a faint hint of her. And it did not disappoint him for even a second. It wasn't the daily graceful sway, but a rushed walk. But somehow this looked more appealing than anything he had seen before. Vidya was drenched from top to toe. Her saree clinging tightly to her body accentuate her curves. He did not know if he actually saw it or his mind was imagining the raindrops rolling over her waist and neck. He could see every curve of hers and it was just the way he had imagined it. He was grappling all that he could with his eyes. 

Vidya: 

Vidya was cursing her luck with every step and her temper at this point knew no bounds. Her trip back home was not uneventful. After much effort, a rickshawala traveling with his family finally chose to give her a lift till the entrance of the village on the main road. Once she was uncomfortable inside the already cramped up rickshaw, she could not help but notice that the driver was ogling at her, which even the driver's wife noticed and Vidya was unceremoniously asked to get down by her within a few minutes. The remaining part of the journey was spent walking in heel deep mud. She didn't even realise when her chapals came apart. Now her only fear was getting hurt. 

As she neared her house she saw the ugly old fart standing in the veranda of his house and staring at her unabashedly. She had seen her ogling at her many times lustily and noticed him hanging around the compound of their house trying catch a glimpse of her. But she had let it all go unnoticed owing to his old age. However, her foul mood made this blatant staring intolerable and she stared back at him angrily spitting venom. Somewhere during this stare, she tripped and fell in the mud. Though the fall was hard, the soft ground ensured that she wasn't injured. 

But before she could gauge the situation and come to her senses, a pair of hands grabbed her by the shoulder and lifted her up. 

She didn't know what snapped in her, but as soon as she was up on her feet, she wheeled around and gave on tight slap to Manoj. Then without looking back she rushed to her house.

Manoj:

He had all the right intentions of helping a lady in distress, but it had all turned upside down. Instead of gratitude he had received a dose of humiliation. The slap on his cheek had cut-in deep and hurt him deep down. He looked around to see if anyone else had seen what had just transpired but the darkness had befallen had made it difficult to decipher. He saw her rush towards her house within a flash. But that was the last thing on his mind. An usually quiet and happy go lucky guy was seething with anger. The blood rushed to his brain leaving little room for rational thinking and he dragged himself towards her house with bloodshot eyes, tightened mouth and clenched fists. He pushed the door open and walked in.

Vidya:

In her rush to avoid confrontation and not creating a ruckus, Vidya rushed in without bothering to latch the door of her house. She straight away rushed to her bedroom to get rid off her soiled clothes and prevent herself from soiling the floor. There was no electricity, so she quickly switched on the emergency light in the room and began undressing. As she removed her pallu and turned around to see herself in the mirror, she got a rude shock. Instead of sharing at her own reflection, she was looking in the eyes of a monster. That pot bellied, dark skinned, bald individual with thick skin was familiar but this moment the blood shot eyes betrayed every bit of familiarity. Within a fraction of a second his hand was around her neck trying to squeeze the life out of her.

Manoj:

At that moment all Manoj wanted was revenge for the slap. But the feel of her soft skin in his roungh palms, the terrified look in her eyes, the way the droplets trickled down her face, her neck and her heaving chest. And lastly her sight of her bosom in her blouse melted his heart. He loosened his grip slowly and moved his thumb slowly up her neck wiping the glistening drops of water and sweat. Vidya had closed her eyes by now. Eventually he moved his thumb across her luscious lips slowly relishing the feel of it. His loins started stirring. Slowly Vidya opened her eyes and they looked in each others eyes. That's when reality hit him like a rock. His stomach lurched. He was in the house of chieftain's son alone with his wife in what may seem like a compromising position. It was her word against his. He realised the consequences of this will never end in his favour so without much ado he ran out of the house.

Vidya:

His departure left Vidya confused. She wanted this to end but did want him to go. Maybe it was the guilt. But why did her guilt arouse her. She saw herself in the mirror and kept staring at the way she looked. The long hooked nose. The heaving well endowed breasts in the drenched blouse accentuating her bra. The visible cleavage. The hourglass waist which was glistening in the dim light. The deep set navel. Even the shadow cast by her looked appealing. At that moment she had clarity which made her take the next step. She knew exactly what she wanted. She wrapped her pallu and walked out of her house towards Manoj's. 

As soon as she reached there she noticed that the door was ajar and Manoj was standing in the centre if the candle lit room facing the door. She confidently walked in the room. Her heart was beating fast and there butterflies in her stomach were wreaking havoc of anxiety but she still portrayed to keep her calm. She locked the door behind her and walked straight upto him all the while staring in his eyes. The water dripping from both their bodies soiling the floor. He suddenly went down on his knees not even looking in her eyes and asking for forgiveness. She had him where she wanted. The heat emanating from her did betray any emotion though. She started pulling up her saree exposing her feet with anklets in them. Then her perfectly curved calves and lastly the well toned thighs. All the while, Manoj was staring at the floor with his eyes closed and begging for forgiveness. 

Vidya bunched up her saree near her waist and held it in one hand and with the other she grabbed his bald head and pulled him closer towards his pussy. Instinctively he smelled the scent emanating for it and kissed it lightly over her wet panty. He moved his fat rough palms on her ass and gently squeezed them. Then he put his fingers in the waistband of her panty and slowly pulled it down. All this while he was planting soft kisses on her panty. Vidya was relishing the feel of opposite gender's skin on hers. 

Finally when Manoj kissed her bare hairy pussy with his thick lips, she let out a huge sigh. She put her head back and started enjoying the way Manoj was kissing her pussy. She opened her legs wider and let him in. He was doing magic with his tongue and lips rolling it across the length of the pussy. Within minutes Vidya was seething with pleasure and moaning away to glory though Manoj had not ever inserted his tongue. Maybe it was the weather and erotic nature of their recently established relationship but those ripples of orgasm shook Vidya to the core.

Once the orgasm subsided she pushed him aside and started walking towards the inner room taking of her clothes one by one.

Manoj:

Manoj was dumbfounded to watch her walk inside while stripping. First the blouse and bra came off followed by her saree. By the time he could see her completely naked from behind she was already in the dark room. He grabbed the candle and followed her in. When he saw her next she was basking in her naked glory in the dimly lit room. Manoj place the candle and took off his clothes. The contrast in their naked bodies would have been visible even to a blind person. There was Vidya - well toned body, hour glass figure and perfectly shaped ripe breasts with brown nipples. Then there was Manoj- stout, dark ugly. The exact opposite of Vidya. 

Vidya held the base if his mid-sized cock and pulled him closer towards her, while she her self was lying down on the floor. He was on top of her, with his thick frame leaning on her delicate one and his dick being guided to her moist pussy. As soon as the tip of his cock touched the entrance of her cunt, Manoj winced. She held him closer in an embrace and planted her lips on his and then moved her hands over his back towards his hips gently nudging him to push. Manoj responded by kissing her back and pushing his cock in. He could feel his foreskin role back as his dark cock was being engulfed in the folds of her pussy. The juices from both their bodies were covering their inner thighs. The peculiar smell of juices, bodies and sex was thick in the room. Vidya gasped as the entire length of the cock entered her. 

Manoj could feel the velvety folds of her young tight pussy on his cock. He started pounding her gradually increasing his pace. With each stroke of his he could see her taut flesh ripple and her tits bounce. He went down on her boobs and sucked them while pounding her.

Vidya:

The feel of his dick was heavenly. The discomfort initially caused by his belly had vanished. She was lost in the pleasure of each stroke. Moaning her heart out. Her moans were somehow drowned in the thunder and rain. The way he sucked her nipples made her cringe with ecstasy. She could feel her orgasm building up. Soon Manoj arched his back, squeezed his ass and shoved his dick in harder and deeper. With a loud moan and some swear words he pumped his seed in her fertile pussy. She could feel the tension building in his cock as it twitched. As soon as his cum touched her pussy she came with loud guttural moan arching her back against the floor and tears of pleasure in her eyes. 

Soon both of them recovered from their orgasms and lay next to each other panting and their combined juices stuck to their genitals thinking about the future of this relationship.
