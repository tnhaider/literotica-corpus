 The day had finally come to meet. They had talked and tantalize each other for weeks and now they would be finally able to put their imaginations to use. Sandy kept looking at the clock at work knowing that there was a good chance Tom was at the motel be then. Tom also was continually looking at the clock with the same thoughts running thru his mind. Not soon enough the hour struck and Sandy quickly went to change and freshen up. The timing was finaly right. Her husband was away on a trip and Tom had a business meeting in her town on the same day.

The two of them had dreamed about this day and had planned what and where they would meet if the opportunity every came up. Now was the day and soon would be the time. Both were in a very nervous state. Sandy parked her car and went into the restaurant to meet him. All sorts of fears were racing thru her head. "Will he like what he sees? Am I too Fat? Does these outfit look to sleazy?" These and so much more was troubling her. 

As she walk into the room her eyes adjusted to the lower light and she tried to look casual as she scanned the room. There in the corner was the man she had come to know and respect as a kind and gentle soul. She knew with that first glance into his eyes that this was exactly what she had been needing for so long. She could tell that he felt the same way. His eyes softened and a look of relief came over his face. He too was relieved to know that she would not hurt him emotionally. He had been afraid that she would stand him up, or turn and run at the sight of him. He saw in her eyes a look of a friend that had been lost for so long and now was found.

Tom stood up as gentleman does to greet Sandy as she approached the table. He reached out at first just to shake hands but as she continued to step closer he took her into his arms and hugged her as if they truly were old friends. It was hard to believe that this was the first physical meeting. Sandy smiled up at Tom and stretched to kiss him on th cheek and then thought differently and gave him a kiss filled with innocence and want.

After the first moments of nervousness they sat down and started to cautiously chat. The waitress brought them their food but it grew cold as they talked and became more comfortable with each other. finaly the time came to move on. Sandy grinned and ask him how his room was and if she could see it. This startled Tom and he stuttered for a moment and then said "lets go check it out". 

His room was not to far away and they soon where at his door. They stopped and there was a moment of silence. Sandy laughed a little and told him "It might help to unlock the door so we can go in" To which Tom said "That would be a good idea" and laughed also. The tension was broken again as they entered the room. 

Once inside Sandy turned around and with a twinkle in her eye put her arms around his neck and gave him a kiss that put the first to shame. Never in his life had he been kissed so deeply or so passionately. He could tell that this was no ordinary woman. This was a women that most men dreamed of. He felt suddenly drunk and knew that that wasn't possible because he hadn't had a drop to drink.

He returned her kiss and tried to match her passion. This only encouraged her and she continued to kiss him. Soon he found himself sitting on the edge of the bed and Sandy was standing looking at him. He could smell her scent and was aroused even more. She smelled like a combination of Lilacs, Roses and Vanilla all stirred together. It was a scent that both aroused and relaxed the senses. Her hands were on his shoulders and for a moment she just looked into his eyes and smiled.

Now it was his move. He gently pulled her down till she too was sitting on the bed. He felt the silkiness of her long hair and the memory of something she told him once came to mind. She had told him that she would show him what long hair was best for, and he could hardly wait. 

As they kissed he found himself slowly undoing her blouse and at the same time she was working on his clothes. The difference was that she was having more luck in exposing him. Soon her hand was resting on the core of his being, and it having a mind of it's own was rising to the occasion. Sandy stopped but only for a moment to move into another position. She was now down on the floor on her knees and was extracting him from him pants. Once he was exposed she stopped again and just enjoyed the sight of him. Then with a smile and another twinkle she took him into her mouth and he felt her tongue licking the underside of his cock. Slowly she licked much like she would a lollypop. Up and down, sometimes in a straight line and others in circles. She seem to greatly enjoy the head of his cock. Each time she got there she would moan very softly and he could feel the vibrations vibrating all along the length of him. With each lick she took him a little deeper into her throat. All of a sudden he noticed that she was sucking him with the back of her throat. It was a new experience. At the same time she was caressing him with her lips also. It was as if there were two mouths working on him instead of just one. It soon became too much for him to take and with an explosion so violent he came deep in her mouth. But that wasn't the end. Unlike most women Sandy continued to suck and lick until all of his cum had been extracted form him.

Exhausted and spent he laid back to relax and gather himself. Sandy took this opportunity to slip his pants on off. He hadn't realized that he was still for the most part dressed. Sandy then gently slipped off the rest of his clothes and tucked him into bed. He quickly fell asleep exhausted. 

Sandy smiled and kissed him on the forehead and he gave a grin. She then went into the bathroom and took a shower. She was by no way finished with him. Sandy took her time in the shower enjoying the feeling as the water ran over her body. She loved showers, they always reminded her of a waterfall, so refreshing. As she stepped out of the shower she heard him stir. This brought a smile to her face and she thought now for me.

Sandy returned to the bed and dropped her towel and climbed into the bed with him. As she cuddled close his arm reached out for her and she snuggled closer. She allowed her fingers to wander all over his body, slowly so as to not wake him to quickly, but enough that he would wake up. As soon as he was in a state of dozing she bent over him and once again took him into her mouth, this time it was just to get things started. As soon as he was awake enough that he was joining in, and he had risen to the task at hand she straddled him and slowly ever so slowly descended onto him. This was another thing she truly enjoyed. There was nothing as exquisite as a first entry as far as she was concerned. She loved how a cock would spread her pussy open. Stretching it to just the right fit. And then the feeling of being total full of cock. It felt so good that she had to just sit there and scrum just a little. Had to get every last piece inside. Ahhhhh! the joy of it all. Now slowly she began to move, up....and....down....up and down, slowly going a little faster. Now Tom was completely awake and he too began to move. Soon they were in "the lovers dance" and realizing that all the wait was worth every moment. He loved how her hair would caress his balls every time she came down on her stroke. It tickled and he loved her hair. 

Before he knew it Sandy had leaned over and started to nibble on his ear never missing a beat. From his ear she continued on to his neck and then almost bent in half to nip at his nipples. This was getting to be too much he thought and took control. It was his turn to show her what he could do. He flipped her over onto her back and quickly returned to her warmth. By this time he was so hot he thrust into her, never stopping to think that he could hurt her like that. All he could think of was getting back inside of her. But it was not a problem because as he thrust into her she moaned and he knew that she wanted ever inch he had to offer. She wrapped her legs around his and held on. He had never felt this hot in his life. It was a feeling he could get used to very easily. Soon he was near his limit and he could tell she was too. He had this sudden urge to burry himself in her and he grabbed hold of her butt and pulled towards himself with all his might over and over until they both came with and earth shattering explosion.

Exhausted they lay there not disconnecting until he had shrunk enough to fall out. When he did he heard the strangest thing. Sandy moaned with a sad little moan. He asked her what was wrong and she laughed and told him that it had felt so good that she hated for it to end. He laughed at that and told her that "we will just have to see if we can go again in awhile." "That's a promise" she winked at him as she got out of bed to get in the shower again.

Laying there in the bed gathering his wits he decided that a shower would feel so good and maybe things would start again in the shower. He smiled as he walked into the bathroom and stepped into the shower with her. She had heard him enter the room and had smile as the same thoughts went thru her head. This was turning out to be a great day.

She felt rather than heard him get into the shower with her. The next thing she felt was his hands caressing her back as she lathered up her body. He reached around her and took the soap from her hands. Then soaped up her back lingering on her ass and reaching thru to her pussy with the soap. She was already wet and not just from the soap. The next thing he knew the soap dropped to the floor and she bent over to pick it up. The sight she made was too much for him and he grabbed her waist and with one swift stroke entered her. Her sigh was so sensual and full of desire that he almost came on the spot. As she stood back up and tossed her hair back, it stuck to her back mixing with the soap and water. He had to just stand there for a moment to keep from erupting. This was too much for her and she began to move ever so slowly. Her hands by now were on the wall to support herself or she would have collapse right then and there. He too began to thrust into her enjoying the lather they were making. Soon the sensations got the best of him and he erupted filling her with his seed once again. Never in his life had he produced this much cum in such a short time frame. She truly was a special woman.

Stepping form the shower they wrapped the massive towel around themselves and went back into the bedroom. Laying down on the bed he hoped she wouldn't want more because he was having serious doubts as to if he would be able to rise again. As it turned out this was not to be a problem. Sandy cuddled up to Tom and quickly fell asleep Exhausted. Sometime during the night Sandy must have gotten up, dressed and left to go home. When Tom awoke the next morning all that was left of their meeting was a long stem rose on the pillow and an ache in his loins. A sweet reminder of the night of passion they had shared.
