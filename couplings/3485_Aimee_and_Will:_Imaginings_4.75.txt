Dear Will,

I want to share my most recent imagining with you:

I walk into the bedroom ...
see you lying in the bed ... 
sound asleep.  

You are lying on your back ...
with only your boxers on.  

I tip-toe into the room ...
remove my clothes ...
climb onto the bed ...
prop myself up on a hand ...
and gaze at you.

My eyes drink in your brown hair ...
graying at the temples ...
rumpled from sleep ...
the night's growth of beard on your face ...
your slightly rounded abdomen.

I slowly pull down your boxers.  
You move and mumble ...
I pause ...
waiting for you to fall back into a deep sleep.

I eye your magnificent cock ...
semi-erect ...
making my mouth water.  

It draws me to itself.  
I lean over ...
lick around its head.  

You stir ...
I wait. 

I lick along the sides of your cock.
It hardens. 

I take your cock into my mouth ...
moving it past my lips.

I suck first down ...
then up ...
drawing my cheeks in ...
I squeeze ...
take it out ...
lick all around.

I feel you move.  
With your cock still in my mouth ...
I look up and into your beautiful blue eyes.

A smile appears on your face.

You reach down and cup my breast ...
flicking my nipples ...
rolling them between your finger tips ...
making them hard.

You pull me close to you and kiss my lips
You roll me onto my back ...
lean over me ...
kiss me deeply ...
yet gently.

You move your head down my body ...
kissing and licking ...
everywhere you pass.

You slip a finger into me ...
smile that I am wet already ...
expecting you.

Your head moves to where your finger was ...
your tongue replaces your finger.
You draw my clitoris with your lips ...
grunt approval when I moan. 

You pull me on top of you ...
your cock flattens against your abdomen ...
presses against my pussy ...
between my thighs.

I place my hands on your chest ...
rub my pussy along your cock.

I rotate my hips ...
sliding slowly ...
teasingly.

You lift my hips...
bring me down ...
against the tip of your cock.

You watch my face ...
smile as my eyes widen ...
when your cock enters me.

I sit upright ...
your cock slides deep inside.
I reach behind me ...
massage your balls.

Hearing you moan ...
makes me happy.

Bringing you pleasure ...
satisfies me.

You roll me over ...
hover over me ...
push your cock into my pussy ...
hard ...
strong ...
deep.

You hold my face in your hands ...
rock into me ...
with me ...
as I rock back.

Your cock feels so good ...
fills me ...
deep inside.

We gaze into each other’s eyes ...
We build to climax. 

Moans escape our mouths ...
enter and fill the room.

You push down on my shoulders ...
I wrap my legs around your hips ... 
we come together!

You roll off ...
lay next to me ...
hold me in your arms.

Looking at you ...
I smile.  

You know what I’m feeling ...
you know what I need ...
you understand me!

We lie still for a few moments, resting ...


before starting all over again!

Dear Aimee,

Your imagining encouraged me to experience one of my own.  Here it is:

Taking your hand, I escorted you into the bedroom.

I pulled you tight against me, leaned down, and lovingly kissed your lips.

I reached around behind you, raised your shirt, and unsnapped your bra.
I unbuttoned each button while looking deep into your own blue eyes.
I pulled off your shirt and your bra dropped to the floor.

I unsnapped your pants, bent down, and pulled them to the floor.  
Taking your hand, I helped you step out of them.

Kneeling, and with my teeth, I began pulling down your panties.
Reaching behind you, I squeezed your buttocks then pulled your panties the rest of the way down.
I gave your pussy a playful lick.

You took my hands and pulled me to my feet.
I stood a moment admiring your body.

You pulled my polo over my head. ...
You leaned forward and licked each nipple.

You unbuttoned my shorts.
As you pulled them down, you knelt before me.
Your hand gave my cock a squeeze through my boxers shorts.
Then you pulled them off.

Looking up into my eyes, you gave my cock a lick.
Then you kissed its tip.
Then you took it, just once, deep down your throat.

Standing up, you led me to the bed.
You lay down on your back.

Your hands drew me toward the bed.
You positioned me so that my head was facing your toes.
You tugged and pulled at me until I was above you.
Raising your hips, told me you wanted me to make love to your pussy.

I leaned down and breathed in the scent of your cleanly-shaven pussy.

I began licking and sucking your pussy.
You took my cock fully into your mouth.

Time stood still as we licked and sucked.
You took my cock deep.
I tongued your clitoris and probed your pussy.
You rolled on top of me.
Time stood still as we licked and sucked.

Our bodies became aroused.

I crawled from beneath you, between your legs
I turned and knelt behind you.

You raised your hips and rested on your hands and knees.
You wiggled your hips, inviting me to enter you from behind.

My cock, wet from your saliva, slipped easily into your saturated pussy.
I began to thrust my cock slowly in and out of your pussy.
You pressed back against each thrust. 

I grabbed your hips and increased our tempo.

You reached between your legs and massaged my balls.
I reached around you and fingered your clitoris.
With my free hand, I pulled your nipples.

Faster and faster we went.

Our bodies tensed.
Our orgasms came at the same time.

We screamed as our fluids erupted, mingling together in your pussy.

I grabbed your hips and pulled your body against mine.
You pushed back.

We held ourselves, immobile, until our bodies stopped trembling. 
Then we collapsed.

We turned on our sides with my cock still deeply ensconced in your pussy.
You snuggled back against me.
I put my right arm under your neck and my left around your waist.
I pulled you tight.

"Thank you," I whispered.
"Thank you," you whispered back

The afterglow of my orgasm was intensified because I knew that I had left something of me inside of you.

We sighed contentedly, then drifted off to sleep together.
