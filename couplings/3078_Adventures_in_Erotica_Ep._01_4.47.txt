She saw him across the hall from the office. Mark was the new, attractive guy; he was tall, masculine, and had a nice jaw line. Most of the girls were talking about him during hushed conversations, or during lunch. Sara didn't pay much attention to him until she overheard from a coworker that he had broken up with his very serious girlfriend about 9 months ago, and he hadn't been on a date since. This piqued Sara's curiosity, so she started scoping him out and paying more attention.

Sara started to dress more provocatively. She wore tight skirts that sometimes only came to her mid thigh, exposing quite a bit of her perfectly toned legs. To show off more of her ample cleavage, she wore tops that were low cut. Everything she wore was still professional, but very close.

That week, she came up with a plan to seduce him. There was a big meeting in the afternoon with most everyone in the building. She knew there would be some slides and probably some boring speeches, but Sara had a way to liven things up. Early that morning, she walked into Mark's office shortly after seeing him arrive. She noticed that he was on the phone, and waited for him to finish. Sara made sure to seem carefree, and not at all impatient about having to wait. She simply looked around the office from where she stood near the entrance. Fiddling with the hem of her skirt drew a quick glance from Mark, and when Sara picked some imaginary lint off her top, she knew he was looking.

Sara was about 5'6", with deep red hair that went a little past the middle of her back. It was curled in long, large locks that seemed to bounce whenever she moved. Nothing she wore could completely hide her form, but what she was wearing that day simply accentuated it. She had on a black skirt that stopped just short of her mid thigh. Her shoes where a dark red, matching her hair. They were high heels, but very delicate looking. Straps looped around her ankles and further showed them off.

Mark's phone call was business, but when it seemed she wasn't paying attention, Sara noticed him stealing glances. She peeked at him, then moved off the left to inspect his book shelf. While facing away, she casually glanced at the titles, mostly office books. Slowly, she looked at books lower and lower on the shelves. Sara bent lithely at the waist, knowing that her perfect heart-shaped ass was pointed in Mark's general direction. When she began to thumb through the books on the lowest shelf, she thought she heard a very subtle groan, perhaps a grunt of surprise. The redhead's skirt cinched up just a bit while she was bent over, and he could see more of her tanned thighs. Sara could hear him clearing his throat again while on the phone, and finally a hasty goodbye.

After clearing his throat again, he waited. Sara stood up, not too fast, sensuously When she straightened, Mark could see that her gray top shifted a bit, exposing just a sliver of well-toned back above the top of her skirt. Finally, she turned quickly around, and sauntered over to stand in front of his desk. "Um, how can I help you...?" he stammered out quickly, trying to maintain eye contact. Mark shifted in his seat, and Sara wondered if he was already starting to lose blood flow to his brain.

Smiling, showing off a perfect set of white teeth behind full, pouting lips. "This is your first week here, right? I'm Sara," she grinned while proffering her hand, palm down, almost as if she was daring him to kiss it. Before he gripped her though, she straightened it out and gave him a regular shake. "Now that the formalities are out of the way, Mark, we should go to the meeting together. It will be a good way to get know the people you work with." Leaning down on the desk, she knew he could see deeply into her top, her bountiful chest on display, barely constrained within the lacy black bra Mark could just see hints of.

Sara watched his eyes, and noticed that they only strayed to her chest once. She mentally commended him. "S-sure." He cleared his throat again readjusted his legs on his chair. "What time should we meet, and where?"

She smiled coyly at him, "We'll meet here, I'll come get you. I'll see if we can find a good seat in the auditorium." Sara winked at him, then stood up, and started walking towards the door. Her rear sashayed back and forth, hypnotizing Mark. After she walked out the door, Sara heard him release a deep breath, and she smiled.

It was almost too late when Sara came to his office to get him. When they finally arrived at the auditorium, there was only standing room in the back. Sara beamed inwardly, noting that her plan had worked perfectly. The host was just showing a very lengthy presentation, and the lights were dim. "C'mon, follow me," she said to Mark, and grabbing his hand and pulling him along behind a large group of people standing and watching.

   Mark followed along, and she settled in a particular spot, and maneuvered him directly behind her. There was little elbow room, since the auditorium was so full, so the two were standing very close, almost touching. Sara pretended to pay close attention to the speaker, while she shifted imperceptibly back, brushing her ass against him. It was just a feather-light touch, but she heard him gasp behind her. He didn't have anywhere to back up. People later than them to arrive had already filled in behind them, so he was stuck. Sara could feel him try to move around, try to back away, but he couldn't. She smiled, and started to very subtly swish her hips back and forth, acting as if she was just being jostled by the crowd.

   Very soon, she felt him. She knew he couldn't help himself as she pressed more firmly against him. Sara's taut rear end began to slide up and down Mark's crotch. He was rock hard in an instant, and she liked the way he felt against her. Her breath quickened as she started to get warm. Sara ran her tongue quickly over her lips and realized she was starting to get very turned on. He was bigger than she assumed.

   "Um, Sara?" He whispered as he leaned forward, while at the same time trying to pull his hips away from hers, unsuccessfully. "I, uh, I have to go do something real quick. I'll be..."

   "Shhhh," she whispered back, using the communication as an excuse to push back firmly against him. Mark was so turned on, he could barely whisper coherently. With no female contact in nine months, she was pretty sure he was about to explode right inside his pants. She motioned for him to lean down so she could whisper in his ear. As he did so, she gyrated her ass in a circle, pressing against his tool. She heard him cut off a groan. She moved her head so she was whispering directly into his ear, and very quietly said, "If you need to leave, I can go with you, and help out with.. whatever, since it's so important. Or, we can stay here." As she said this, Sara stepped up on her toes, pretending to look over someone blocking her sight. The motion caused more friction where they touched. Mark shuddered and looked around helplessly, though it was obvious everyone was paying attention to the speaker.

   Sara settled back down from her tiptoes, and slid her rear against the entire length of his shaft through his thin slacks. Mark could feel her muscles flexing, pressing against him. He begun to breathe harder, almost panting. Finally, Sara whispered again, right into his ear, "So, are we staying, or going?" With that, her red lips were so close to his ear, he could feel her breath. She flicked out her pink tongue and brushed the tip against his ear, eliciting a quiet gasp.

   Able to take no more, Mark motioned to the people behind him that they needed a way through. The throng parted a little, and he squeezed through, Sara right on his heels. When they were out of the auditorium he spun to face her, "What were you doing in there? You could have gotten us both fired!"

   Sara began to pout. The corner of her lips curled into a cute frown, and her eyes, became downcast, almost looking embarrassed. She walked up slowly to him, apologizing. "I'm sorry, I didn't mean to, we were just packed so tightly in there." She was standing close to him now, so she reached out a hand, and slid her palm against his still raging erection. "Oh! He doesn't seem to mind, why do you?" Sara became coy as she gripped him through his pants, lightly rubbing him. "Everyone is in the meeting, you know. No one is going to be here in this hallway." With that, she used her finger tips to circle the head of his manhood, gently, teasing. Mark groaned loudly as she used her other hand to slide down his zipper, still looking at him with her huge eyes.

   "Please... This isn't right," he panted as she reached into the opening and slipped her fingers around his thick shaft, pulling it out. He fell back against the wall, unable to resist anymore. Sara's soft hands enveloped him. He felt like an ember against her cool hands. As she pumped slowly, she glanced down and saw that he was close to orgasm already. Moisture was oozing out of his slit, and she used her thumb to swirl it around the glans, wrenching a moan from him.

   Sara grinned wickedly as she began to slide down his body, crouching down in front of him. She stared, unblinking, right into his fearful eyes, as she guided the head to her lips. The shine from Mark's tip matched the gloss of Sara's lips as they slowly parted and she kissed him wetly. Mark looked on mesmerized as she stared directly at him, and he felt her tongue begin to swirl against the tip, as bit by bit of his head slipped inside her puckered lips.

   Sara savored the taste, and wiggled her tongue just inside his slit to coax more. She needn't have worried, however, because more and more precum was trickling out. She slurped at his member and slid one hand around to his ass, pulling him towards her. Her other hand snaked out and began to caress his balls. She lifted one, then the other, then palmed them both. As her lips slipped over the entire crown of his twitching member, she stopped, gently sucking and slowly swirling her tongue over just his tip. 

   Ignoring his feeble attempts to resist, she pushed him gently against the wall. As she followed, her head didn't stop when he did. Mark watched as Sara's incredible lips wrapped around his shaft, then slid wetly down the entire length without stopping. She could feel his head push against the back of her throat, so she swallowed, and let him in the rest of the way. Her slick tongue was sliding up and down the length of his cock, pressing hard against him. She started to pull off him, just to swallow him completely, over and over again, but very slowly.

   Mark was shaking and panting, moaning and groaning. "Y-you ha-ave to stop-p." He trailed off to incoherency as she began humming happily. Sara pushed her head all the way against his crotch, lips forming a tight circle around the very base of his cock while her tongue dance madly underneath. She felt her own body spasm lightly. She brought a finger down to her thighs, and slipped inside the skirt. Having worn no underwear, her finger made immediate contact with her sopping gash. She was so turned on, she had to stop or she would take this too far, too soon.

   Sara could tell that Mark was about to cum. There was a constant stream of precum that she constantly swallowed, he was jerking and grunting, his balls were tightening up in her palm, ready to let loose. The only reason he hadn't exploded yet was because the sexy redhead had been moving so teasingly slow. Suddenly, she pulled off him, and released him completely with a loud smack of her lips. Mark gasped as she slipped his rock hard member back in his pants, and zipped him up. Standing up quickly, Sara said, "Ok, I guess I went a little far. I'm sorry, I'll stop." She was pressed against him, and panting gently. Her lips were puffed up and thick from her recent ministrations. Her tongue slipped out and ran over her full lips, and she rested her hands on his chest.

   Mark was leaning against the wall, confused, and still jerking slightly as all stimulation stopped. Reflexively, he gripped her slender waist, pulling her closer, grinding his still engorged tool against her hips With just a little more contact, he would have slipped past the point of no return. Sara thought about letting him dry hump her and cum in his own pants, but instead pulled back slightly and said, "Calm down now, Skippy, this is neither the time, nor the place for that. If you're a good boy, I may let you inside, soon." She paused and reached down to the hem of her skirt, slipped inside. Her eyes closed and she moaned quietly while she slid her fingers over her smooth skin, and slipped two fingers inside her soggy slit.

   Pulling them back up, she reached up and touched her fingers to Mark's lips, tracing them, leaving them shiny with her excitement. Her hand snaked around behind his head, and pulled him down to her as she devoured his lips with hers. Sara eagerly sucked his lips clean of her sweet juices, swirling her tongue against his, pushing inside, she moaned into his mouth and pressed her entire body tightly against his.

   Breaking the kiss, she whispered in his ear, "You want to be a good boy, right? You want to get inside me, don't you? I bet you can just imagine my skirt pulled up to my waist, and you sliding deep inside, feeling me around you while you cum. Don't you want to just explode deep inside my dripping wet snatch?" She finished by pushing her tongue against his ear, running along the edge, and sucking his lobe. With that, she turned around and walked back into the auditorium, adjusting her skirt as she walked. Before she disappeared, she turned her head back to Mark, who rested panting and confused against the wall, and blew him a kiss.
