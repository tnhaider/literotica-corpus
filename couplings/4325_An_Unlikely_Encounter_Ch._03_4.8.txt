 Do not reprint this work on any other website, or any medium, without the express consent of the author (me!).

Author's note: This story is the third (and final) part of a series that has two earlier submissions. It is a direct continuation of the last story, and assumes the reader already knows the previous events and has had a chance to have the characters introduced. Read alone at your own risk!

I would like to express a special thanks to Meg, who took the time to suffer through my writing and offer invaluable feedback. She is responsible for the death of many superfluous ellipses.

Synopsis: In the previous submissions, a high school English teacher (the protagonist) finds himself being pursued by Autumn, one of his students. She slowly breaks his will, and engages him in a series of compromising encounters, forcing him to admit and give into his attraction to her. Despite this, he still attempts to resist her to avoid getting caught. The last story left off with her seducing him into her bedroom. The afterglow of their tryst is shattered by the realization that her parents just arrived home.
