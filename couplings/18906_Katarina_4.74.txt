 "So what kind of name is 'Katarina'?" I asked my roommate.

"What do you mean, 'what kind of name is Katarina?'" replied Katarina tartly.

"I dunno, just seems kind of exotic..." I said.

"Could I ask you a favor?" said Katarina. "Would you mind just not talking to me for the rest of the night? I have a lot of homework to do."

I stared at her from my bunk, narrowing my eyes and shaking my head. How did I get stuck living with a such a bitch--a woman no less! Would my entire first year be like this? Would I constantly be getting the short end of the stick?

I turned back to my physics textbook and tried to concentrate on my own homework. To hell with trying to make friends with her.

"It's Russian," she said finally without looking up from her book.
