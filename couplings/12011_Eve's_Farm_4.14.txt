Romantics argue that the modern custom of marriage arose from the emotion of love; and that throughout the millions of years of our evolution, humans have always gravitated to exclusive pair bonding. Realists, on the other hand, argue that while love is nice, for millions of years marriage has always been more about male possessiveness and the female need for support and protection --a matter of security more than emotion. I argue that neither of these is correct. What actually caused the invention of marriage was something else entirely. ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~ ~~~~~~
