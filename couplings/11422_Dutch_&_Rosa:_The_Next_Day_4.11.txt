"If you don't mind," she said quietly, "I need to sleep on the left side."

"Sure," he said unconcernedly.

Rosa felt she needed to explain herself and whispered, "The phone and the alarm clock are there. If they go off I can shut them off without disturbing you too much."

He laughed as he rolled to the right side of the bed. "I wake up around five-thirty every day regardless of how late I fall asleep, must have an alarm clock in my brain."

Hanging her dress up in the closet, Rosa nodded and said, "Me too. Only mine goes off at six. But every once in a while I'll oversleep." Chuckling, she added, "Like after a night like this, I might sleep for two or three days I feel so good." 

"Came a few times did you?" He laughed and reached out to her.

"Ummm, I usually count them, but for some reason tonight I lost track."

"Really?"

"Oh yeah . . . you're good, ya know?"

"Go to sleep baby, morning comes all too soon and we've gotta go to work."

"Yeah, work... our salvation and the bane of our existence.
