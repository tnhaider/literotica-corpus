 Chapter 2

Life just keeps getting better

Tom's new duties had redefined his position in the company. Yes, he still worked in a cubicle farm. Yes, he ostensibly was still a project manager who on occasion actually managed projects. But as Gayle had pointed out, that was a job he could do in his sleep, and his boss still underutilized him.

His new responsibilities were the real reason he came to work every day. Gayle was fascinated by his ability to eat her pussy, and frequently called him for what she deemed "private conferences," which generally consisted of him on his knees between her legs, her skirt hiked up to her waist, and his face buried in her dripping box. On one occasion she had him go down on her while she participated in a conference call, a situation he found very amusing when she came in the middle of a conversation. He could prolong her orgasm almost at will, bringing her just to that point then back down several times before her final, pulsating release. She loved it.
