 You may wish to read the prequel to this story, "Making Love on an Island in a Wine Dark Sea" which tells of Maggie's previous adventures on a Greek island. 

Before Rory left her alone in a hotel room on Skiathos, he told her that he had a friend on the island of Skopelos. 

"Actually, he's my boss. A professor of archaeology and a nice, gentle guy. I'll call him and see if he has time to show you around Skopelos."

Maggie was gushing tears -- her idyllic twenty-four hour love affair with Rory at an end as he had to go back to Australia. "I don't know," she wailed. "I'm sorry I'm crying. It's so silly. What will he think? A woman just showing up to see him?"

"He'll think you're cool. Cause I'll tell him. Indulge yourself. You're not in Kansas anymore -- and your preacher husband is a long way away."

Rory made the telephone call. "Okay," he said when he hung up. "You can catch the one p.m. ferry and you'll be there about two. He'll meet you at the ferry landing and take you to lunch. He's tall and skinny, brown hair, 40 years old, and always smiling."

After Rory left, Maggie dried her tears and packed her bags. She dressed in shorts, sandals, and a bikini top which she covered it with a sheer white blouse that she tied under her breasts. For her it was a revealing outfit. She checked out of the hotel, and walked with determination to the ferry landing a few blocks away. "Five days left on my vacation," she said to herself. "I must move along. Goodbye, Rory. Hello, who knows what."
