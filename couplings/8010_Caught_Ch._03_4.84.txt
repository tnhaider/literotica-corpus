***********************************

On Saturday afternoon Brian received a phone call.

"Hello," he said.

"Hi, it's me Evelyn."

"Hey," he said brightly, "how are you?"

"I'm okay," she said in a quiet voice. "I'm sorry I was so abrupt with you earlier today."

"That's okay," he said, "I'm sorry if I said something to upset you."

"No!" she said quickly. "It wasn't you. I, I mean, you said something about, uh, your story that, uh, well, it just made me think of something. It had nothing to do with you."

"Oh," he said slowly, "well, I guess I, uh, well, I'm still sorry you were upset."

"Thanks," she said with a bit of a chuckle. "Well, you're a nice guy and, uh, I shouldn't have taken it out on you."

"Well," he said, struggling to find the right words, "I guess if you ever need to talk..."

"No," she interrupted, "It's just, well, I was a little upset and, uh, it's a really personal thing."

"Okay," he said, "but the offer still stands."

"Thanks," she said with a sigh.

There was a long pause where neither of them spoke, but neither of them wanted the call to end.

"I have to ask you," she said suddenly, "when you said that about Yvette's marriage, uh, you know, that she was, uh, she needed excitement, where did that come from?"

Brian paused and tried to think about what to say.

"Was it," she said quickly, "was it someone you know, or, uh, is it something you heard about, or maybe, uh. I'm having a lot of trouble here! I don't know how to ask this. Maybe it's because English is my second language."

"No, I understand." He said. "You want to know if I made this up or if it was from personal experience."

"Well," she said slowly, "sort of."

"It came into my mind," he said. "It's in books and movies all the time, and you see it a lot in that sort of thing."

"I have to ask you something else that's really difficult," she said.

Again there was a long pause.

"Did you write this with anyone in mind?" she asked. "Is it someone you know or maybe someone you met?"

Brian sighed heavily. He was afraid she would eventually recognize things about Yvette's appearance or mannerisms. 

He stammered a little bit and tried to say something but nothing would come out.

"Is it about me?" she said in a weak voice.

He groaned out loud and his hand holding the phone lowered to his side for a second. He put his other hand to his forehead and pinched the top of his nose. He raised the phone to his ear again.

"Evelyn," he said.

"Really!" she said hurriedly, "is it about me?"

"Look," he said, still struggling to find the words, "I always thought you were so beautiful and, well, it was never meant to actually be you."

"So it is about me," she said. "Yvette is me."

"Only in appearance!" he said desperately. "I modeled her appearance after you. All the other stuff, that was all in my imagination!"

"So," she said slowly, "Stuart is you."

"Not really!" he replied defensively. "It was all a fantasy!"

"You fantasize about me?" she asked with a shaky voice.

He sighed again and fought to say what needed to be said. He was at a loss.

She let out a deep breath and didn't say anything. 

"Look Evelyn," he said, "I really like you and I really enjoy talking to you. But that's all! I know you're married and I know you have the right to be offended for me writing this stuff, but I truly never meant any harm by it!"

She sighed again and stammered something he couldn't understand.

"Evelyn?" he said. "Are you still there?"

"Yes," she said after a moment of agonizing silence, "I'm still here."

"I'm sorry," he said. "I never meant to upset you and I certainly don't want you to feel, well, that you would need to avoid me. I know you might be feeling, well, feeling a little creeped out, but I don't want you to hate me."

"I don't hate you," she said quietly. "My husband goes out every weekend til late at night to play golf and have drinks with his friends. Our phone calls make my weekends a little more enjoyable. I just have to figure out how to deal with, well, that you have fantasies about me."

"They are truly just my imagination," he said. "I'm a normal man. Every man thinks about the women in his life like that. If they say they don't, they're lying!"

She chuckled a little and sighed again.

"Yes," she said, "I guess that's true."

"I hope you don't think less of me," he said. 

"No," she said softly, "I don't think less of you."

"Thank you," he said, "I wouldn't want this to drive a wedge between us."

"There's something else," she said warily.

"Yes?"

"Well," she said hesitantly, "that part about the marriage, where she needs excitement because, well, her husband is not, well, exciting enough?"

"Uh huh?" 

"Did you know?" she said so quickly the words tripped over each other.

"Know what?" he asked in confusion.

"About me?" she said so quietly he almost didn't hear.

"About you?" he said. "What about you?"

"About me and," she said, almost choking on a tear as she did, "well, my situation; with my marriage I mean."

Brian was at a complete loss. He stammered a couple of words but sentences were beyond his capabilities.

"I like to read those novels I told you about," she said as if stating her confession to a priest, "because they tell of, you know, the women in those stories, well, they seem to experience things that, uh, I don't."

Sudden understanding came to him and he swallowed hard. With some surprise he realized he was feeling guilt; guilt for exposing Evelyn's secret, even if he did it inadvertently.

He stammered a few words and then tried again. Still, nothing intelligible came out.

"It's okay," she said softly, "I can see you didn't know anything about it."

"No," he finally managed to say, "It never even occurred to me."

"But it did!" she insisted. "You wrote about it in your story! So it obviously occurred to you!"

"But that was from my imagination!" he said, "I told you, Yvette looks like you, but she's not you!"

Evelyn gave a sad chuckle.

"It turns out," she said, "she is."

Brian closed his eyes and, once again, regretted ever writing this story in the first place. Although he very much enjoyed writing it, and had revelled in the fact that Evelyn enjoyed reading it, he now realized it led to this point. She was now completely downhearted because she thought he had guessed at her biggest secret. Who wants the people in their lives to know their marriages are unhappy? Or that they may have made a mistake in choosing their mates?

"She must be feeling completely exposed and humiliated," he thought.

"Brian," she said in a choked voice, "I need to go now. I'm feeling kind of down and I have to go."

"I understand," he said quietly. "Call me if you, you know, if you feel like talking some more."

He heard her choke out a rueful laugh and then she said goodbye. When the line went dead he put down his phone and stared out at the balcony for a while.

************************************************************

A few hours later Brian received a text message. "Send me your picture?"

He studied it for a moment and his eyebrows furrowed in thought.

"I want to see your cock!"

The second text popped up and his eyebrows now went up. 

He looked back through some of the photos in the same text stream and felt himself getting hard. 

"I want to look at it while I think about sucking it."

That did it. He dropped his pants and took a quick photo of his now very erect penis. He sent it and a few minutes later received a picture in return. It was a close-up of the woman's mouth. She was holding what looked like a rubber dildo. It was a very life-like model of a real penis. The head was in her mouth and her lips were clamped down on the shaft just beneath it.

"I'm looking at your cock and sucking it!"

"You're so sexy!" he typed in reply.

"Do you like seeing me sucking you?"

"I'm really hard thinking about you."

"When you cum, you'll be cumming in my mouth!"

"That will be soon," he said as he began stroking himself.

The next text told him to stop masturbating. It also gave him an address. "Be there in twenty minutes," it said.

He fastened his slacks and grabbed his keys and he was out the door.

He arrived at what looked like a professional building. He got out of his car and looked up at the address to make sure he had the right place. Another text arrived as he stood outside the building.

"Go to the third floor to room 304. Don't turn on the lights!"

He did as instructed; thinking as he went it was like some sort of treasure hunt. When he arrived at the door he looked up and down the hall, wondering if this were a setup. With misgivings he opened the door. 

Inside it was completely dark. Only the area immediately inside the door was lit by the lights in the hall. 

He went inside and a whispered voice told him to close the door. He searched the gloom looking for the source of the voice but could see nothing. He frowned but closed the door behind him.

As soon as he did he felt a pair of hands reach around to his belly from behind. He felt a body pressing against his back and reached with his own hands to explore. They immediately fell onto a very well formed girl's buttocks. Reaching down a little further he touched the bare skin of her thighs. Moving back up he squeezed her bum and she sighed into his ear. He turned and found himself face to face with someone only inches away. A soft pair of lips touched his lightly. 

He put his hands on her back and pulled her close. She melted into him as their kiss grew from one of discovery to a passionate embrace. Her tongue pushed past his lips and he responded.

She put one hand on the side of his neck and it traveled up to ruffle his hair. Her other hand rested on the small of his back and pulled him close.

He allowed his hands to trail down past her buttocks where he gripped the hem of her mini-skirt and pulled it up to her waist. 

"I left my panties at home!" she whispered hotly against his cheek.

He growled in response and moved his hands all over her bum and between her thighs. She was soaking wet!

She took a few steps back and he felt a table behind her. She scooted up onto the table and spread her thighs. He kissed her once more and then fell to his knees. With a voracious passion he buried his head into her pubis. She gasped and gripped his thoroughly messed up hair with both hands. He pushed his lips against her labia and plunged his tongue deeply inside her. She groaned and he felt her lean back as one hand left the top of his head, presumably so she could lean back on it.

For the next few minutes he moved his face up and back against her, licking and lapping at her with gusto. The whole time she purred and sighed as the sensations built her toward climax. He pushed his tongue against her clitoris and then nipped at it lightly with his teeth. 

She cried out as her thighs clamped against his back. He felt her shudder and quiver as her orgasm rippled through her. After her grip relaxed he stood once again. 

He felt her hands fumble with his belt and zipper. She giggled softly as she fought with the fastenings and then pushed his slacks to the floor. 

She kissed him hungrily as she gripped his cock with a soft hand. She stroked it deftly and laughed softly against his lips as their kiss went on. 

With a gentle shove she urged him to step back. She fell to her knees and then his cock was engulfed in the warmest mouth he could remember.

Just as he savored the feel of her over his cockhead she moved down slowly but inexorably to the root. He was now completely in her mouth and he gasped as her tongue explored the underside.

She moved back up to the head and then it popped out of her mouth.

"Will you cum in my mouth?" she said pleadingly. 

The soft huskiness of her voice almost made him cum right then. She plunged his cock back into her mouth and began a slow sensual blowjob. Her lips locked onto it like a vice all while her tongue rolled around and stroked it.

He leaned back against the table and closed his eyes in bliss. This woman knew how to give a blowjob! 

She put one hand on the shaft and stroked it up and down, now wet with her saliva. At the same time she rolled the hand around in a twisting motion. The motion of her hand combined with the sucking action on his head was driving him quickly to completion. 

When his cockhead began to swell in anticipation of shooting she placed both hands on his bum and drove her mouth back and forth along its whole length. He grunted and then gasped; and then it came.

His balls seemed to wrinkle into themselves as they shot their contents up his member. He felt a burning as they emptied and then the semen blasted into her mouth.

She grunted and held on as he came. Her lips locked onto him and her mouth grew warmer as his semen filled it. He felt her cheeks puffing in and out as she sucked everything out of him.

He let out a huge breath as he finished and leaned back against the table completely spent. 

She was on her feet before he knew it. She scurried to the door and opened it. He caught a quick glimpse of her from behind as she was silhouetted against the lights in the hall. She was not tall; probably about five foot two. Her hair was black and cut to about shoulder length. She was wearing the turquoise, yellow and green floral print mini-skirt he had come to know so well. He couldn't see her blouse; she was wearing a white waist-length jacket up top. He wondered if she even had a blouse on underneath.

After that one quick glance she was gone. He heard the click of her heels as she ran down the hall outside the door.

He reached for his slacks and pulled them up as he made for the door. He looked quickly in both directions up the hall but there was no sign of her.

His phone buzzed and he was not surprised to see a new text message. The attached picture showed her mouth up close. There was a film of white fluid coating the lips. A second picture arrived showing her tongue swabbing at the white film on her lips. Now a trail of white showed down the side of her lips that led to her chin.

"That was delicious!" the next message read. "You made me cum just like you promised! Amazing! I really enjoyed making you cum in my mouth."

"I must see you again!" he wrote in response.

"Soon!" the reply came. 

He turned back into the room, this time turning the lights on. It was a plain small office with a cheap table and straight backed chair against one wall. That was the only furniture in there, the same table on which they had given each other oral.

He sighed, though he could not determine whether it was a sigh of pleasure, resignation or frustration. He smiled and left the room and the building. When he got to his car he looked around to see if there were any cars with black-haired women sitting in them. He saw no one; just a few cars parked here and there with no sign of any people for at least a half block.

He put the car in gear and headed for home. He got no further than a couple of blocks when his phone rang.

"Hello," he said after the Bluetooth engaged.

"Brian!" The voice said happily. It boomed through his car stereo and he could tell she seemed almost to be laughing.

"Evelyn?" he asked.

"Yes it's me!" she said. "Who did you think?"

He laughed as he heard her chuckle at her own joke.

"I know," she went on, "you weren't really expecting me to call back so soon were you."

"Well," he said, "no. I thought you weren't feeling very happy so I didn't expect to hear from you til Monday."

"That's true," she said, "I wasn't feeling very good, but I've been doing some things that made me happy; very happy in fact!"

"Really?" he said. "What kinds of things?"

"Oh," she said evasively, "nothing you need to know about. I just feel better and I wanted to talk to you."

"That's okay by me," he said. 

"You know," she said, "I read the passage you sent to me earlier."

"Really?" he said, "what did you think?"

"I think Yvette is a bit of a slut sometimes!" she said with an uproarious laugh. "She took the waiter and the taxi driver! Not to mention what she did with Stuart in the backseat!"

"I think she wanted to get even," Brian said.

"Well she really did!" she said, still laughing. 

"Did you enjoy reading it?" he asked. "Did it pass muster?"

"I really did!" she said. "And I especially liked when she laid down the law at the end!"

"I thought you'd like that part," he said with a grin.

"I should go now," she said. "I'm driving home so I should concentrate on the road."

"Oh yeah?" he said. "Where are you coming from?"

"None of your business," she said in a mock stern voice.

"Okay," he said, "I get it. But a guy has to try."

"Sure you do," she said with a chuckle. "See you later."

The line went dead just as he was pulling into his apartment parking garage.

************************************************************

-I've done something terrible! I shared your story with Maria.

-Evelyn

-

-

Brian read the email and couldn't help but grin. Maria was the office receptionist. She was a short Latina, only about five feet tall, if that. She was very pretty with long auburn hair that she typically wore over her shoulders. Sometimes she tied braids into each side of her head letting the braids fall forward over her chest. Although she was probably not much more than a C up, on her small frame they looked much bigger. She also had curvy hips that made her legs look extra short.

-Does she know who wrote it?

-B

-

-

He wondered if that would be a bad thing. He decided it probably would be.

-I don't know. I might have hinted that I knew the writer, but I didn't get specific.

-Evelyn

-

-

He shrugged and decided if they were going to share the story around the office, it couldn't be much worse if he was found out as the writer. 

-Oh well. Did she say anything about it?

-B

-

-

-She loved it!

-Evelyn

-

-

Brian grinned again. At least he was helping the ladies in the office. 

"It could almost be said to be a public service," he thought to himself and then laughed at his own joke.

-I guess that's a good thing.

-B

-

-

-Are you kidding? She asked me if there was more.

-Evelyn

-

-

He really did laugh out loud after that.

-I'll see what I can do.

-B

-

-

************************************************************

Brian went to the office lunch room to heat up the cup of coffee he had been nursing for the last hour. As he waited for the microwave to finish he heard giggling.

Just then Maria walked into the room wearing a big grin. She looked at him with bright eyes and chuckled a bit.

"Hi Brian," she said.

"Hi," he said with a suspicious expression.

"How's it going?" she said playfully.

"Okay," he replied, still giving her a wary eye. "Is there something...?"

"Something?" she said with a smirk. "Yeah there's something."

She leaned against the table. In her oversized beige sweater and her white denim slacks she looked adorably cute. Her hair today was loose as usual but a single wide braid was pulled forward to hang over her chest and reached down almost to her belly. 

"Okay," he said with a suspicious grin, "what is it?"

"You know," she said in hushed tones. Her smile was wide and beguiling.
