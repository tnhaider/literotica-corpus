 Mary had just finished braiding her long dark hair back and turned to check her reflection in the mirror. Not bad. Her full breasts filled the navy blue bikini cups perfectly and the dark fabric created a V between her newly svelte hips. The navy blue really brought out her dark blue eyes as well. She slipped the navy blue and white polka dot sundress on over the bikini and tied the halter-top around her neck. It too showed off her cleavage to its best advantage and the hem ended just above her knees. 

She sighed happily. This was the beginning of a new life for her. She had shed the extra weight and had laser surgery on her eyes before moving to New Zealand. She had also taken a vow... no more regrets. She would take chances. She would say yes to life. She might just say yes to Chris, even though she had only met him the night before.
