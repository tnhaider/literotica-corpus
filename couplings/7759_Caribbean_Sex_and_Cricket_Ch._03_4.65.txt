 My story so far: Flying to the Caribbean to watch part of the England cricket tour of the West Indies I had entered into conversation with my seated partner Julie.

Chaperoning her much younger sister Sara, elsewhere in the plane, Julie was not so interested in the sport but more in getting time away from her errant husband, and intent upon visiting a previous lover on an adjoining island. Meantime Sara, although making it obvious she was interested in me, had hitched up with a married couple and I had taken her attractive married sister to dinner on our first night in the hope that things might develop sexually between us. Our conversation over the delightful meal in romantic surroundings had, after two bottles of Californian Chablis, descended to a sexual level. We both agreed that we should have sex, but at a later stage when Julie had come to terms with her marital morals.

We were sharing the same hotel and had arranged to meet by the pool for breakfast, but in the middle of the night, the telephone beside my bed rang softly, the highly erotic conversations with Julie had kept me from sleeping deeply. I had tried masturbating without success, with my new married friend I wanted the real thing. It was about to happen much sooner than either of us had planned.

"Mmm?" I had muttered sleepily into the mouthpiece.

Of course it was Julie.

"It's me."

"Hello, Julie, what's up?"

At her next words I sat bolt upright, my head clearing instantly, my cock saying 'Yes!'

"Tom, I can't sleep."

I laughed softly, "Nor me, I wonder why?"

I heard her sigh softly into the phone, "I want to talk, Tom."

I switched on the bedside light, looked again at the time, and frowned, "Go on then, I am a good listener."

"No, I meant face to face. I've just come off the phone to my husband."

Instantly awake, I leapt out of bed, searching for something to wear.
