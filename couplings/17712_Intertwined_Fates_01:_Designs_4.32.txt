 Chapter 1/30

Full Summary: Joy Velasquez's life was the ordinary normal life of an office secretary until her sexy boss Carl Knight seduced her. Who knew having a bit of fun late at night in the office could turn into something so wonderful and great, but also terrifying? Carl and Joy soon find themselves immersed in a fight to save humanity. Carl's slightly un-hinged ex-wife, Miranda, opens a dark ancient portal to gain unstoppable power and unleashes an unspeakable evil onto the world while the royalty of vampires threatened by the hundreds years old prophecy come after them from another side. Torn between two worlds and two fights, they ride a rollercoaster of love, life, death and destruction, all the while, trying to figure out how to stay together. A tale of love, lust, and the fight for humanity.
