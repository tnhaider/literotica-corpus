Report Begins...

On September xx, 1974, I was sent to xxxxxxxx to bring back to the States a young female named Kxxxx. Being the xxxxxxx xxxxx that she was, she needed to come home now that the xxxxxxx war was ending and everyone was going to be moved back to the States or the Philippines, but she was needed back in the states to be xxxxxxxxx so she would be able to function at home or placed where her innate skills could be utilized. What was so special about her. She couldn't xxxxx any disease. She was able to carry them for a xxxxx, after that, she was no longer xxxxxxxxx.
