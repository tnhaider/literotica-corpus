 HIAWATHA'S WOOING
By SexyGeek with homage to
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow

The mighty hunter, Hiawatha,
Through the dark and gloomy forest, 
Sought his prey and shot his arrows,
Brought the meat to old Nokomis
By the shores of Gitchee-Gumee,
By the shining big sea water.
All the tribe knew of his prowess,
Recognized the mighty hunter.
And when Hiawatha's hunting
full of meat had filled the storehouse,
then he turned to other pleasure.

Of the women in the village
Hiawatha could call to him
Any one which caught his fancy
For they all knew of his talent
In the bed as well as hunting.
Mighty stood his cock at evening,
Strong his strokes again at sunrise, 
All the day it rose up ready,
And throughout his lusty screwing
many maidens felt orgasms.

As the little Wah-wah-tay-see,
As the fire fly, shining insect,
flashes always in a new place,
So the cock of Hiawatha
Mighty organ to fill pussies,
Moved among the village women,
Giving pleasure to a new cunt
Every time he sunk it deeply.
But even as he took his pleasure,
Every time he sucked a nipple, 
Every clit that felt his licking,
Every pussy brought to climax,
His thoughts turned yet into the distance,
dreaming still of Minnehaha, 
of the lovely Laughing Water
in the land of the Dacotahs.

“Wed a maiden of your people,”
warning said the old Nokomis,
“Are there not some beauteous boobies
and fine pussies in our village?
Like a fire upon the hearth stone
Is the screwing of a neighbor.”

And then Hiawatha answered,
“All the pussies of our people
To my cock have yielded nicely
And my thrusting have enfolded
'Til my climax filled within them.
Fine these cunts are to my member
Fine its hardness deep within them.
But yet my thoughts turn from their wetness
To the beauteous Minnehaha
Laughing Waters of the Dacotah,
Most beautiful of all the women,
Sexiest of all the women.

“Tits she has of rounded beauty, 
Soft as the plump grouse Mushkoda'sa,
Soft and yielding to my fingers.
Nipples on them grow up strongly
As Miskodeed sprouts in springtime,
The Spring-Beauty flower which rises
Above the snow drifts, standing proudly,
As they stiffen, pretty nipples,
When my tongue does roll around them.
Ah, the softness of her belly
and below it full of beauty
The soft fur upon her pussy, 
Soft as skin of  Adjidau'mo,
Like the fur of little red squirrel.
Then the pink lips of her pussy
Flash below it, calling, tempting,
And my cock springs into hardness
Thinking now of Laughing Waters,
Yearning for my Minnehaha.
To the land of the Dacotah
I must go and heed her calling.”

Then departed Hiawatha
To the land of the Dacotah,
To the land of lusty women;
And he journeyed without resting
Til he heard the water falling,
Heard the Falls of Minnehaha
Calling his cock through the silence.
In the water she stood laughing,
She stood naked in the water,
Waiting for her Hiawatha.
Down the water poured upon her,
O'er her shoulders gleaming naked,
Down it rippled cross her titties,
Rolling wild around her nipples,
Bringing them to full erection
So they stood in hardened glory.
Then the water crossed her belly,
Rippling over gentle roundness,
And found the soft hair of her pussy,
Gently wetted mound that lay there
And then trickled past the soft lips
Swelling now as there she waited
For Hiawatha's hard cock coming.

With soft hands she rubbed her boobies,
Teased her nipples into hardness,
Squeezed them there for her excitement.
Then her fingers sought the softness
Of her slit between her soft thighs
And rubbed its soft pink wetness.
Round her clit she traced a circle,
Hard her hips thrust as she rubbed it,
Soft she moaned and closed her eyes tight.
But before she reached her climax,
Round her waist she felt his strong arms,
Mighty muscles folded round her,
Reaching forth to grab her titties,
Squeezing hard her standing nipples.
Startled, turned then Minnehaha
To behold her Hiawatha.
Into his strong arms she melted,
Pressing close her naked body
To the strong chest of her lover.
Hiawatha reached behind her,
Pressed her soft ass toward his body,
Pulled her tight against his manhood.
Softly in her ear he whispered,
“Lead me now unto your father.”
With a final press against him,
Minnehaha drew him shoreward,
Donned the dress she had forsaken,
Turned unto her father's wigwam.

There sat the ancient arrow-maker
of the land of the Dacotah.
Of the past the old man's thoughts were,
And the maiden's of the future.
How she longed for Hiawatha,
How she wanted strong hands on her,
How she dreamed his cock was throbbing
in her virgin dripping pussy.
And Hiawatha's thoughts the same were,
Of his hardened member thrusting
Deep in Minnehaha's vessel,
Of his semen spurting from it
Filling her with new life starting,
Giving her Hiawatha's future.

To the ancient arrow-maker
in the land of the Dacotah
Hiawatha gave his presents.
Skins of Kenabeek the serpent,
Made for showy decoration
of the clothing of a leader;
Mahnahbe'zee yielded feathers,
White swan feathers for a headdress
Fitting a chief of the Dacotah;
Skin of Ahmeek, soft and warming,
From the beaver of the waters
For a bed old men can dream in;
A new Chemaun, made of birchwood,
A fine canoe to ply the river;
Dried meat in plenty, flesh of Ahdeek,
Reindeer jerky for his eating;
These and many gifts of richness
Hiawatha gave for Minnehaha,
Gave for soft and rounded titties,
Gave for ass of glorious beauty,
Gave for pussy like a flower's bloom,
Waiting for his shaft to enter.

So with the arrow-makers pleasure
Hiawatha took the maiden,
Took the beauteous Laughing Waters
From the land of the Dacotah
To the shores of Gitchee-Gumee,
To the wigwam of Nokomis,
Daughter of the Moon, Nokomis.
“Now,” said mighty Hiawatha,
Let a feast be made and ready,
Let the hunters bring their bounty,
Let the women tend their cookpots,
Let the beer be brewed and heady,
Let us honor Minnehaha!”

For seven days the tribe made ready,
And seven nights did Hiawatha
Pass outside Nokomis' wigwam
As in the dark his Minnehaha
Was watched well by the old woman.
Mighty cock and virgin pussy,
Each of them yearned to the other,
Hiawatha and Minnehaha,
Each of them dreamt dreams of coupling,
But not yet they came together.

Hiawatha, on his pallet,
Felt his cock grow to full hardness,
Felt his dick throb for her pussy,
Felt it seeking to reach climax.
But no soft pussy was around it,
Only his hand had Hiawatha, 
So he jerked his hungry member,
Rubbed it softly, teased it gently,
Rolled his thumb around the opening,
Pulled it faster, pulled it harder,
Dreaming of his Minnehaha,
Thinking of her soft wet pussy.
Harder, harder, now he rubbed it,
Til it spurted on his bedroll,
Til his sperm flowed forth all milky.
Then all sated did Hiawatha
Fall asleep outside the wigwam.

Minnehaha lay down restless,
Thinking of her Hiawatha,
Dreaming of his hardening member
Deep inside her soaking pussy.
She listened to the old Nokomis
Til the woman's softened breathing
Told the maid that she was sleeping.
Then so softly Minnehaha
Stole her hand beneath the covers,
Ran it over her soft belly,
Let it travel to her round mound,
Let it linger on the soft fur
Lying just above her pussy.
Then she gently ran a finger
Down her slit which opened gladly
To feel the gentle stimulation
of Minnehaha's masturbation.
Round and round she moved her fingers,
Sought the hardened bump of pleasure,
Ran them down around her hard clit,
Rubbed it softly and then faster
Until with pleasure she moaned gently.
Careful not to wake Nokomis,
Thinking of her Hiawatha,
Higher she rose in her excitement
And her hips rolled in their pleasure.
Gently now she sought her wet cunt,
Putting her two fingers in it,
Pressing lightly but not deeply,
Touching not her maiden's glory,
Her maidenhead for Hiawatha.
Fast she rubbed, and with fast breathing
She was rushing to her climax.
With a smothered gasp she reached it,
Felt the waves of pleasure rippling
Cross her wet and throbbing pussy.
Then, like the waiting Hiawatha,
All alone slipped into dreaming.
Thus the separated lovers
Spent the week before their wedding.

HIAWATHA'S DANCING

On the day before their wedding
Came the dancer, Pau-Puk-Keewis,
Greatest friend of Hiawatha,
Took the hand of Hiawatha,
Led him off into the forest.
There the friends of Hiawatha 
Waited for him to give him honor,
With much dancing for his honor,
For his cock they gave him honor.
Pounding drums set forth the dancing
And the men danced in the forest,
Danced until their heads were pounding
Like the drums played in the forest.
Then unto them came the women,
Came the most beauteous of the women,
Came to dance for Hiawatha,
Naked came into the forest,
Naked danced for Hiawatha
One last dance for Hiawatha.
Their oiled bodies to the rhythm
Of the drums they turned and twisted
Swinging titties, moving asses,
Thrusting pussies for Hiawatha.
The men watching felt their hard cocks
Throb with lust for dancing women.

To the great hunter came the women, 
To Hiawatha naked bodies,
Rubbed boobs on his hard chest muscles,
Rubbed their pussies on his hard thighs
Pulled his loincloth off his body.
Then his mighty member sprang forth
And the women gasped with pleasure,
Seized his dick and stroked with soft hands,
Rubbed his cock for his arousal.
To her knees then fell the boldest,
Knelt in front of Hiawatha,
And drew his cock between her titties,
Placed it in the soft warm cleavage,
Rubbed it softly with her titties.
Hiawatha put his hand out
to the second of the women
With her large soft bouncing boobies
And pulled one to his waiting lips,
Sucked the nipple in his warm lips,
Sucked and pulled upon the nipple.
His other hand he thrust forward
And opening then another's soft thighs,
Felt for the soft and dripping pussy,
Deep into the waiting pussy,
Wet his fingers dipped into it.
On his cock he now felt soft lips,
In her mouth he thrust his hardness,
Let her suck him for his pleasure
As the warriors clapped and shouted.
With excitement Hiawatha
Felt that blowjob on his hard cock,
Sucked with lust on hardened nipple,
Thrust his fingers in that wet cunt.

Then the women changed position,
Sat Hiawatha on a blanket,
New pleasures to give Hiawatha.
One pushed her ass against his peter,
Rubbed his dick between the soft cheeks,
Twisted her butt to rub his hard cock.
Another spread her legs above him,
Let her pussy down upon him,
Pushed her cunt where his tongue waited.
On his chest the third rubbed titties,
Rubbed her nipples hard against him.
Seeing Hiawatha thus excited
All his friends grabbed their own cocks,
Rubbed their own cocks for their pleasure.

Now the women pushed Hiawatha
Til he laid down on the blanket,
Laid with hard cock springing upward,
With his shaft up throbbing quickly,
With his dick seeking a pussy.
Wet and warm it was enfolded
In a soft and clenching pussy.
Deep he thrust into that wetness
And all around him saw the women
Likewise treating all the warriors.
One pussy left his throbbing manhood
And another turned her soft ass
To his face and clenched his hard cock
With her cunt and twisted on it,
Up and down she twisted on it
While he plunged deep in her pussy.
Soon another took his cock in,
Squeezing hard her cunt around it,
Pulling its shaft deep within her,
Letting wetness grab and hold it,
As Hiawatha drove to climax.
But she slipped from his hard throbbing,
Moved off his cock as it strained upward,
And another cunt enfolded it,
Wrapped her sweet pussy all around it
While his cock throbbed deep within her.
Thrusting hard into that pussy, 
In his hands he felt two others,
Probed with fingers in two warm cunts,
While soft boobs met his wet lips
And soft titties rubbed against him.
All the women of the village
Honor did to Hiawatha
On the night before his wedding.
Teasing, tempting, thrusting, licking,
Clenching pussies on his hard rod,
Every woman taking pleasure
One last time from Hiawatha.
Deep he thrust into each pussy
Til he felt his climax building,
Grabbed the hips of one upon him,
Arched his back and high his hips raised,
Shot his cum into the pussy,
Filled the warm and waiting pussy
With his semen as his dick throbbed.

Then he laid back on the blanket,
Saw around him all the warriors
Taking pleasure with the women.
Even the devoted drummers
Stopped their rhythm for some fucking,
Were beating now into a pussy
While the pounding drums went silent.
In her wigwam old Nokomis
Smiled a knowing smile on hearing
All the drums go into silence.
But the beauteous Minnehaha
Did not know that in the forest
Hiawatha and the warriors
Screwed with all the village women
One last time before the wedding.

HIAWATHA'S WEDDING

Sumptuous was the feast Nokomis
Made at Hiawatha's wedding
As the wedding guests assembled 
Clad in all their richest raiment.
Then they said to Chibiabos,
To the sweetest of all singers,
“Sing to us, Oh Chibiabos!
Songs of love and songs of longing.”

And the gentle Chibiabos
Sang he softly, sang in this wise:
“Onaway, awake beloved!
Thou the daughter of the waters,
Thou the wondrous Laughing Waters!
Thou with eyes so soft and fawn like,
Thou whose hair falls round thy shoulders
Like the Waters of the river
Fall o'er the rocks with sounds of laughter.
Thou whose breasts rise up like young deer
Playing together in the forest.
Let thy nipples rise and harden
With the thoughts of Hiawatha,
When in love he shall embrace you.
Thou whose soft and rounded buttocks
Sway before him to entice him,
Rub against him to raise ardor,
Bring his organ to its hardness.
Thou whose pubic mound is covered
With soft hair like small Wabas'so,
Silky hair of the little rabbit.
Thou whose woman's parts are comely
Like red Odah'min the strawberry,
Like a flower when they swell open
Waiting for entrance of Hiawatha.

As unto the bow the cord is,
So unto the man is woman.
Though she bends him, she obeys him,
Useless each without the other.
Join now with Hiawatha,
Minnehaha, Laughing Waters,
Yield thy softness to his hardness,
Draw him into your deep wetness,
Let his organ throb inside you
Til it shall give life unto you,
Til Hiawatha's child is started
By your love shared on the blankets.”
Thus the song for Hiawatha
And his lovely Minnehaha
That the gentle Chibiabos
Sang in tones of deep emotion.

When the wedding feast was over,
When the last guest had departed,
Then the mighty Hiawatha 
Looked upon his Laughing Waters,
Held his wife, his Minnehaha
Closely to him, pressed against him.
Softly then he led her
To the bed he had made for them,
To the furs piled soft and waiting,
To the soft hide of Pezhekee',
Warm wool of the giant bison;
To the yielding skin of Ahmeek,
Smooth caressing fur of beaver;
To the pillow stuffed with feathers
from the owlet Ko'ko-ko'ho;
To the bed prepared for loving,
Made to receive their first combining.

From her lithe and curving body
Hiawatha took her dress off,
Left her naked on the bedding,
Left her enticing in her nudeness,
And he looked there down upon her
Whose gentle beauty made his rod hard.
Reaching up she tore his loincloth
Off his mighty thews and left him
Nude as she was, ready for her,
Ready to consummate their wedding.
Hiawatha knelt beside her
And his hands sought out her beauty,
Sought her rounded tits enticing,
Rubbed them softly and then harder,
Rubbed the nipples til they stood up.
Minnehaha moaned with pleasure
As he stroked her pretty nipples,
As he squeezed her soft round boobies.

Reaching up a hand she held him,
Held his hard rod standing forward.
Soft she stroked it, felt its hardness,
Felt it throb for yearning for her.
Then she rubbed it harder, faster,
Jerked his cock and pulled it to her,
Ran her hand over all its hardness.
Hiawatha felt her hands upon him,
Felt his dick react with pleasure,
Felt his hardened cock enjoy it.
With one hand still on a titty
Down the other roamed across her, 
Down across her flat hard belly,
Down onto her nest of soft hair, 
And below it found her wet slit.
Gently gently his finger found it,
Rubbed it softly and felt wetness
Growing there beneath his rubbing,
Wet and swelling was her pussy
As he rubbed his hand across it.
With his thumb and with one finger
He grasped gently the hardened bump
And rolled it between his fingers
Giving her exquisite pleasure.
Softly gasped then Minnehaha
As he rolled and rubbed her hard clit,
Round and round he softly rubbed it.

Now her hips rose up to meet him,
Begging for more stimulation
Of her pretty virgin pussy.
So Hiawatha's mouth moved downward
Til his tongue could deeply lick her,
Til his lips could suck her hard clit,
Til he tasted her salty cunt juice.
Then he straddled Minnehaha
So his cock was bound for her lips
And she could suck hard upon it.
Deep in her mouth she took the hard rod,
Ran her tongue around the shaft's head,
Licked the ridge which gave him pleasure
As his tongue ran in her pussy.
Both of them were thus excited,
But Hiawatha had the wisdom
Of much experience with women
To know that fucking is best done slowly.
So he pulled his cock from her mouth,
Took his tongue out from her pussy,
Lay beside her softly stroking
Gently up and down her body.

Then he rose and lay atop her,
Spread her legs and laid his rod on,
Rubbed his cock against her pussy,

Soft his cock rubbed swelling cunt lips,
Up and down he rubbed her pussy.
Slowly slowly he pushed further
Into the wet depths with his hard cock.
Felt with the tip what lay before it,
Felt inside her virgin hymen.
All along her quaking body
Now he pressed his hard firm muscles,
Pressed himself against her
So she felt his strength all over.
Hard she held him, pulled him to her,
Raised her hips against his driving
Sought his hard cock deep inside her.
Now Hiawatha drove into her,
Hard he shot his cock down deeply,
Found and tore the virgin's doorway,
Broke her maidenhead with one stroke.
He heard her gasp and felt her hips twist,
But then she pulled him even closer,
Pulled him deep into her wet cunt,
Holding his cock with tightened pussy,
Rising to meet his throbbing member,
Locking her legs over his legs,
Twisting her hips to give him pleasure,
She held to her Hiawatha.
With his cock plunged deep into her
He jerked it hard and twisted strongly
So they both felt great excitement.
Then to tease he drew it outward,
Drew it out to pussy's entrance, 
Drew it almost out of contact
With the wet soft depths before him.
Held it waiting, throbbing gently 
Against the swollen lips it rubbed on.
Both tensed then, waiting, waiting,
Feeling together anticipation
Of their screwing's final moment.
And then with a mighty shudder
Hiawatha thrust into her, 
Forced his mighty dick into her,
Drove his hard shaft deep into her,
Reached the depths of her soft pussy,
Thrust its length all in her pussy.
Hard they pressed their hips together
As each then reached a mighty climax,
With soft moans they reached their climax.
His dick throbbed as forth cum spurted,
Filled him with the greatest pleasure
In the depth of that warm pussy.
Minnehaha felt contractions
Deep within her soft warm pussy
As she had never felt before this
And she clutched her lover's member
Tightly as she felt her pleasure.
Hiawatha's sperm shot into her
As her pussy clenched around him
And drew it to her womb awaiting.
Then spent in all their sexual pleasure,
In each others arms they rested,
With his cock laid next her pussy,
Sharing the warmth of their first fucking,
Sleeping softly for the first time
As a wedded pair of lovers.

Next morning old Nokomis
Softly sought their bed of pleasure,
Found the white skin of the rabbit
