Alexis Vaughn 

...The Arrival... 

It was late afternoon on a Thursday when Alexis' plane touched down in Las Vegas. Sin City was a place she had never been. The bright lights of the strip were starting to gleam as her limo pulled down the center of the strip. She was a bit in awe of the experience already. This was the first time she had ever arrived at the airport to a limousine waiting for her; a man holding a piece of paper with her name, "Vaughn, Alexis" on it, just like in the movies. "Alexis Vaughn" wasn't her real name, but for the course of this story it will be her alias. Soon you will find out why. 

She sipped on a bottle of water even though she had rights to the entire mini bar. She was very nervous but very surprised at the graciousness of her hosts. The man drove quickly down the busy street. Alexis was a little in awe of the hotels and the lights. The whole scene wasn't something she was used to. 

She saw her hotel, "The Grand", which was in the center of the strip. She couldn't believe it when she looked up. Forty floors, three buildings, one of the newest hotels in Las Vegas. The limo driver pulled up right at the entrance and opened the door for Alexis. He removed her luggage from the trunk area and walked her up to the concierge desk. He thanked her and walked back to the limousine. I guess you could say this was the no turning point for Alexis as she gave the concierge her name. The room, a suite on the twenty-seventh floor, was paid for by her host. It was booked for three nights. She had an early flight back to Ohio on Sunday morning. The concierge spent a few minutes explaining the hotel and all its amenities. Alexis was trying her best to pay attention, however, she was overwhelmed by the beauty of the hotel and the situation she was in. The concierge walked her up to the elevator and gave her the key card. She boarded the elevator, alone, and rode up to her floor. She walked to her room and slid her card in. Walking in, she saw her luggage on the dining table in the kitchen area. She couldn't believe the room; it was larger and much more luxurious than her condo. She sat her belongings down and drew a bath. She was a little jet lagged and very anxious about her next few days. 

...Alexis.... 

She had grown up in a small industrial town in Ohio. She was married for twenty-three years to her now ex-husband, Josh. Their marriage became stale and her children had left for college. She thought it would perk up once they were out of the house, but it only became more of a bore for her. Alexis was a month shy of turning forty-three and three years removed from her divorce. Her youngest child had just enrolled to a large college in the south. Her oldest of the two was a junior now at a local state college. They were off on their own. She would receive a few text messages here and there and the standard visit on the holidays. She hadn't seen her ex-husband in a few months. She still felt partly responsible for the divorce, but she was trying to move on. 

Alexis was living alone in a small condo a few blocks from her job. She was an office coordinator for a shipping company. The company had been around for eighty plus years. An old building, not remodeled for a good twenty years before Alexis started there. Her coworkers were, for the most part, pleasant but also, honestly, very boring. It was a boring town to begin with. The stories from everyone at work, her friends, were becoming very repetitive. Alexis, after the divorce, became a bit overweight and unhappy with herself. A friend suggested maybe she work with a physical trainer and get her life in order. After a few months, her confidence grew vastly. She was pleased with how she looked; she felt like she looked younger. Occasionally, when she was out for drinks with friends, a lot of younger men approached her. She was always flattered but never willing to admit she was interested; maybe because she was nervous, or she just didn't know what to do. She felt like she didn't know how to live after all those years married. 

Alexis, as she became thinner with a very attractive physique, began to notice attractive people more. She loved how some women looked in a dress; imagining herself in it. She loved the looks she got from the fit gentleman at the gym. She felt a part of this new club. She was beginning to enjoy being looked at and noticed. 

Something was lacking: sex. She had a few toys and that worked okay for her. She had gone out with a few gentleman but all of them her age were looking to settle down; not something she was interested in. Occasionally, a younger man would approach her. She couldn't get past their age, usually barely older than her own kids. She always felt that someone she knew could be one of their parents and couldn't fathom the shame of being caught up in something like that. 

One night, while enjoying a glass of wine, a special airing on HBO caught the eye of Alexis. Her movie ended and she was about to call it an evening when a deep voice spoke, "The secret life of a porn star." She turned and looked at the screen, a bit shocked. Not really noticing her actions as her eyes were glued to the TV, she poured herself another wine and sat back on the couch. Apparently, it was part of a series and this episode was women over forty in porn. Alexis was stunned but also interested. Most of the documentary was interview, one-on-one based. A man was asking each of the women why they started in the lifestyle, what they enjoyed about it, and the negatives, etc. Each time they brought up a new actress, they would show a few minute clip of them in a movie. Usually the clip had sex but nothing too hardcore given that it was just HBO. Alexis felt aroused by the idea and by the end of the show knew more about these three strange women than she ever imagined. Two of the women had been in the industry most of their adult lives. The third joined when she turned thirty-five. Like Alexis, she was divorced, but her new boyfriend worked for a pornography company. A producer at the company had noticed her and asked her boyfriend to bring her by. She couldn't believe it at all but was very interested by the opportunity. She said it was partly for the money, and partly for the sex and adventure. She liked having fun, and this was safe and controlled. She talked about the first time she ever heard the term "MILF" or "Cougar." She found the whole idea unrealistic and hysterical. Finally, she ended up doing an audition and signing a contract with the company. Now, at forty-five, she has made over 50 movies and garnered close to five million dollars in money earned from movies, private events, and merchandising. During most of the interview she openly talked about her love for sex, exploring sex, and how she honestly couldn't wait to be in more movies. 

The next couple of weeks at work, Alexis frequently found herself thinking about that special she watched. She thought of how she always thought that pornography was a negative thing but how now she saw it as natural and not so bad. 

On the Friday before a holiday weekend, Alexis' boss let the staff go a little early. Alexis was meeting a friend for a drink, but it wasn't for a few more hours. She found herself at a coffee shop, on her laptop, in the corner. She sipped her coffee and was staring blankly at her computer screen. Her fingers moved to the keyboard as she typed a very blank but dangerous combination of words into the search engine, "porn star auditions." After she hit enter she quickly shut the monitor to her keyboard. She looked around in a bit of panic wondering if anyone saw. It was a slow afternoon in the coffee shop and no one could see her monitor let alone even have a conversation with her. She opened it back up and started to scroll down the search. She finally came across a link and clicked it. "Sin City Adult Stars," the banner across the top read. She clicked on the part that said female actresses wanted. There was a pretty descriptive questionnaire asking a lot about her body, how she looked, and what she was possibly into. Alexis spent the next half hour filling it out, thinking about each question, imaging herself as that woman on the special she watched. The last section asked for a set of pictures, in different poses. She couldn't believe it; she had very few pictures of herself. She closed her laptop and stood up. Just then, her friend showed up and attempted to sit down. Alexis quickly blurted out she had an emergency and had to go. Her friend, shocked and worried, begged Alexis to tell her what was wrong. She told her it was nothing serious but she had to run. She quickly walked out the coffee shop with her laptop in hand, cord dragging behind her, as she walked out. 

She got home and opened up the website. The company wanted a couple face shots, full body clothed shots, in a bra and panties, and, lastly, nude. She took all of the pictures on her phone in a mirror. She hesitated for a good hour as she contemplated the nude shot. She thought heavily about just sending the application without it. She didn't ever imagine she would receive a call back or even be seriously considered. She figured that there would be no need for a nude. She finished the application and sent it off. She wasn't all that worried she didn't include a picture. Hell, she didn't even know if she wanted any of this to even have a realistic chance of happening. 

Later that week, in her office, she received a call. It was an out of state number so she didn't answer. She stepped out into the hallway to listen to the voice mail: 

"This message is for Alexis Vaughn. Thank you for your application to Sin City Adult Stars. My name is Mitchel and I'm just calling to set up a phone interview with you. If at all possible, could you give me a call back at (915) 437-2248 ext. 488? The phone interview lasts about thirty minutes. Thanks again. Goodbye." 

She almost dropped her phone on the ground as she fumbled with it. Walking down the hallway to the bathroom she stepped inside. She looked around to see if there was anyone else in there but there was not. She played the message again, this time writing down the phone number. Alexis spent the next hour at her desk trying to do work but unable to concentrate. With a few hours left in the day, she asked her boss if she could leave work early. He told her that would be fine. She was in her car in the work parking lot when she called the number. 

...The Interview ...

Voice Mail: Thank you for calling Sin City Adult Stars. If you know your party's extension, please enter it now. 

Alexis quickly pressed 488. The phone rang four times until someone answered. 

Assistant: This is the desk of Mitchel Barnes, how can I help you? 

Alexis: Yes, I'm, um, returning a call to Mitchel. 

Assistant: And your name is? 

Alexis: Alexis Vaughn. 

Assistant: Please hold, Ms. Vaughn. 

Mitchel: Alexis! Hello, this is Mitchel. How are you doing? 

Alexis: Umm, I'm good. Is this a good time? 

Mitchel: This is a great time. So, you're interested in doing adult movies. Any experience? 

Alexis: Umm, no, not really. Is that okay? I'm not even sure if this is really for me. 

Mitchel: Doll, most women feel that way. You have to try it to know if it is for you. 

Alexis: Yeah, this just sort of happened on a whim. It probably isn't for me. 

Mitchel: Well, here is what I'm going to do, Alexis. I'm going to send you an email, and it has about 30 or so questions you have to answer. Also, I will need a nude shot of you. Answer all the questions to the best of your knowledge; don't lie. If you know you won't want to do something, say "no". 

Alexis: Umm, okay. 

Mitchel: Once you get all that information back over to me, give me a few days to get back to you. If we like what we see on our end, and you are absolutely interested, we'll have you come out on us; our treat. We will meet, talk a little bit, and have you do an audition shoot. You'll get paid for it, too. 

Alexis: How much does that shoot pay? 

Mitchel: $1,500 for the audition shoot. You will have to have sex, perform oral, and the basics. If it goes well, a contract would be $10,000 for 5 more shoots. Think it over, work on the email, and get it back to me. 

Alexis: Okay, um, I will look it over. Thanks. 

Mitchel: Great to hear from you, Alexis. Let me know if you have any more questions. Have a good weekend. 

Alexis: You, too. Bye. 

...Alexis finds out more about herself.... 

A week had gone by since Alexis received the email from Mitchel. She had been curiously going through the questions. Some of the stuff, she looked up pictures or movies about the topics. Some, she just said flat out "no". She thought about hiring someone for the nude photo shoot but one night, after a few glasses of wine, she opted to do a picture session with her camera again. She did the best frontal nude she could do and the best back nude she could do. She was very nervous about sending them to Mitchel. He could just go ahead and post them, do whatever he wanted to them. She read through the disclaimers in the lengthy email and decided the whole thing did seem legit. 

The first section was about sex with other females. She didn't think too long on this one. She had kissed a girl in college but that had been it. She thought about it for a minute, then decided to approach it as if she'd go through with it; but only if she had to. She marked a "no" in that column. 

The sex with males' part was a bit crude for her. She had to read more about some of the stuff, but ultimately decided she was okay with the list. She thought how some of the stuff, like facials, was a bit degrading but she understand the value of how much of a turn on it was. She hadn't done that before, but still checked "yes". She had rough sex in college, and she remembered it turned her on, so she checked a "yes" there, too. Each time she looked through the questions and checked "yes" or "no", she got highly turned on. 

The last part of the questionnaire did a little to turn her on, and off, at the same time. It was the fetish section. Some of the things were a bit odd but she took her time on the section just like the last two parts. She mostly clicked "unsure" for all the questions. Some of the stuff like multiple partners and gang bang freaked her out, but she was curious. Bondage was something she did read a little bit about and said that light stuff was okay. She checked "yes" for some of the simple fetishes like submission, smoking, public. 

She was done with the email. She spent a couple of minutes talking herself into sending it. Finally, she clicked "send" and couldn't back out. Alexis was distant from her work. Her productivity was slipping as she just thought about a response from Mitchel and what it would lead to. Finally, the call came while she was at lunch. 

Alexis: Hello. 

Mitchel: Alexis, how are you? It's Mitchel over at Sin City Adult Stars. Is this a good time? 

Alexis: Yes, it's fine. Umm, so what's up? 

Mitchel: Well, you will be happy to know, Alexis that we are going to bring you in for an audition. 

Alexis: Wow, that's great. So, what do I do now? 

Mitchel: I'm going to email you some forms to read through and sign. We will fly you out to Vegas; put you up in a hotel. You and I will do a meet and greet. Then, you will do an audition taping. 

Alexis: So, at the taping, I will be having sex? 

Mitchel: Yes. It would be one scene; usually takes 3 or so hours to shoot. Any questions? 

Alexis: When will it happen? 

Mitchel: Well, how soon until you could get out here? Next week too soon? 

Alexis: Well, umm, I have some vacation days. I would have to check with my boss. 

Mitchel: Okay, just send me over an email if this will be okay. Then, I will send you the itinerary. You don't have to bring anything, really. Just clothes and toiletries. We will supply the transport to and from the airport and to and from the shoot. Sound good? 

Alexis: Okay, sounds great. (She paused after saying that) I will talk to you later. 

Alexis went into work and told her boss she had some family issues out of town, with a close cousin, and asked if she could take the last three days of next week off. Her boss allowed it. The next couple of days at work just dragged. She couldn't focus, given the situation at hand. She wasn't really talking with her friends or family, either. She went home each night and just kept reading about the porn industry and everything. She was excited, but very scared. She got out of the cab and boarded her plane. She had very little luggage, like expected. She wanted a drink on the plane ride but felt she should stay professional. She got off the plane and headed down to the luggage. She wanted to head back on a plane back home but she noticed a man holding a piece of paper up with her name on it. 

...The start of a new adventure.... 

Alexis heard her hotel phone ring. She quickly got up out of the tub and wrapped a towel around herself as she answered it. It was the concierge letting her know that her limousine had arrived. She quickly dried off and changed into a nice pair of jeans and a nice blouse. She didn't want to overdo it and figured this wouldn't be the attire for her scene anyways. She sat in the back of the limo, a bit nervously, as it drove to an industrial looking area in town. She got out and walked into the entrance area. It was a waiting room with a fairly attractive receptionist. Alexis walked up to her and told the receptionist her name and that Mitchel was expecting her. 

Mitchel: (Opened a door to the reception area and greeted Alexis.) How was your flight? How's the hotel? 

Alexis: Everything is great. You are so nice for being this accommodating. 

Mitchel: Well, come on back and let's talk. 

...They went back into an interview area that was heavily lit with lots of cameras... 

Mitchel: Have a seat on the couch, Alexis. (He sat in a chair across from her.) So, from this point forward, we will always be recording. 

Alexis: Okay. 

Mitchel: Great, so just relax. We will go slowly. We're just going to do a little Q & A, for right now. It will be on the sexual side obviously... But let's not forget why you're here. 

Alexis: I'm still not sure... (She laughed and sat back on the couch.) 

Mitchel: At any time you need a break just let me know and we'll stop for a little bit. (He sets a water down on the table in front of her.) A couple of other people will be coming into the room right now. Like I said, we will go slowly. 

.....The production crew came in. At that time, it was only 3 other men besides Mitchel. Two of them each went to a camera as the third went to a microphone. Mitchel gave them a countdown with his fingers, then he started.... 

Mitchel: So, here with me, today, is the wonderful Alexis. Say hello to all your fans out there! 

Alexis: Hello, everyone. (She blushed red and tensed up a little bit.)

Mitchel: I have to say, you are gorgeous, doll. Younger forties you said, right? 

Alexis: Forty-two. 

Mitchel: You don't look it. You are in great shape. Okay, if you say you're forty-two. So, you are from the Midwest. Married? 

Alexis: Divorced. 

Mitchel: I'd have to say that he made a big mistake there. Any kids? 

Alexis: Yes, two. 

Mitchel: So, we can officially classify you as a "MILF." 

Alexis: (She laughed.) Yes, you can. 

Mitchel: Does that term offend you? 

Alexis: No, not really. I guess it does some women. I see it as more flattering. 

Mitchel: So, boyfriend now? 

Alexis: No. (She leaned forward and took a sip of water from the glass on the table.) 

Mitchel: So, sex life? How is it? 

Alexis: It's been sparse lately.
