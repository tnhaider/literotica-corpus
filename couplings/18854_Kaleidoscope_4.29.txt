 she is startled awake by something
heart pounding
the sheet tangled around her soaked
she looks around her studio apartment
she is the only one there 
nothing is out of place
her cat meows as she trips over him on her way to the bathroom for a drink

she flips the light on
and notices her reflection in the mirror
a gasp escapes her lips
her neck is a kaleidoscope of colors
red
blue
purple
brown
tiny blood vessels broken due to a drastic change in pressure

she reaches up to touch one of the marks
it is tender
and it stings a bit under the weight of her fingers
a smile spreads across her face
as she remembers what happened two nights ago
and realizes what is wrong
something is missing

he is missing

she lays back down in her bed
and feels completely alone with out him next to her.
she closes her eyes and tries to remember
the smell of his hair
the touch of his skin
the look in his eyes
the sound of his breathing
the taste of his lips

she sighs and rolls over 
curling up into a ball
and tries to recall that night

they were walking back to her apartment
after drinking at a friends place
it was late
around 2:30 am
they were walking down the street
holding hands
talking
during an awkward silence in conversation
he asks if he may be bold
she answers yes

he stops suddenly 
turning her to face him
leans in 
and kisses her on the lips
when they break apart
a smile is on both of there faces

when they reach her apartment 
the awkwardness returns
they get ready to sleep
and she puts a movie in to break the silences
as they lay there side by side
all she can think about is touching him
but for some reason
she cannot bring herself to reach out
so she lays there 
as still as she can
faking concentration on the screen
wishing that he would move 
two inches to his left
closer to her

eventually she gets her wish 
as he leans over to kiss her again
she whimpers 
his hand moving up to caress her cheek
she tilts her head 
and he trails his kisses down her neck
gentle
then he stops to look at her
she pulls down the neckline of her shirt
and tells him harder
he kisses her lips again
before moving back to her neck
biting hard enough to make her gasp
he looks at her 
and she is smiling

she finally found someone willing to bruise her skin
to leave their mark

she sits up
needing more from him
and takes off her shirt
pausing just for a second
as thoughts of rejection flash across her mind

she lays back down
and his hands and lips are back on her skin within seconds

moments later he sits up 
removing his shirt
and lays down beside her
she rolls over to her side
and lightly touches his chest
fingers traveling down his body
she leans closer 
and licks his neck
kisses him
lets her teeth graze his skin
biting
a sound that is a cross between a moan and a sigh escapes his lips
as he holds her head closer to him 
urging her on

they switch positions again 
so that now he is in control
he is on top of her
kissing
biting
caressing
thrusting his cock against her thigh
he takes ahold of her right hand
and slowly raises it above her head
and then does the same with her left
pinning her down 
kissing her lips
biting her neck

he moves down her body 
to her breasts
kissing
licking
sucking
biting
he pulls her nipple into his mouth
she whimpers
his hand slides down her side
over her hips
across her inner thigh
he pushes the material of her shorts to the side
and slowly lets his fingers slide between her pussy lips
lightly across her clit
her back arches
and she moans

his fingers slid inside of her
and then out again
he starts fucking her with his hand
and all she can think about is how she does not want him to stop


but he does
and again she takes over

she bites his neck 
and licks the place where a bruise will eventually form
she cant recall when he became naked
but she is happy for it
as she lightly touches his cock

her kisses trail down his chest
licking his nipples
kissing his rib cage
the hallow of his stomach 
the spot right above the base of his cock
before licking his cock from base to tip

she smiles as he moans

she licks the head of his cock again
before sliding him between her lips
circling him with her tongue
and sliding him down her throat
as far as he will go
she gags

she loves the way he tastes
the noises that he makes
knowing that she is the reason

her head bobs up and down
her hands in rhythm
she wants him to cum
she wants to taste all of him
but for some reason he holds back

"your good at that," he says as his sits up
bringing her up to kiss him
"i know," she says as he lays her down again
biting her neck
kissing her breasts 
sucking on her nipples

he moves down farther this time
kissing her stomach
moving between her legs
kissing her inner thigh
his tongue making contact with her clit

she moans as she tries to find something to hold on to
arching her back as he slides his fingers inside of her yet again
she calls out his name as the tension inside of her builds
her legs begin to shake
and she tosses her head to the side

she cums 
as she says his name under her breath

he lays back down next to her
kisses her forehead
her cheek
her lips
he asks her if she wants to go to sleep now
she nods
and falls asleep in his arms
