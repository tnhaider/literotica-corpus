 Though it was no later than 4 p.m, not a ray of light could be seen in Sophia's bedroom. There were dark, heavy blankets covering the window and the door was shut. Even though the computer was on, its monitor was shut off. Sophia herself was sprawled across her bed, staring up at the ceiling that she couldn't see. There were times in her life that she found the darkness to be suffocating. Now, however, it served as a private, timeless haven. The absence of light felt pure because nothing contrary to that feeling could be revealed.

There were only two sounds that could be heard in the room; the first was the depressing rock music that emanated from the speakers of her computer. The second was coming from Sophia herself. Though her eyes had long since run dry of tears, the occasional dry sob leapt from her throat. Were there light, one would surely notice the wet streams on her face where the tears had fallen only moments before. She made no attempt to stop the crying and no resolve to control her emotions. Indeed, she barely even noticed when a sob escaped from her lips. Her mind was far too occupied with embracing the nothingness that surrounded her. The blackness allowed her to feel completely numb, which was all that she wanted.

The only thing that had the potential to distract her was the melancholic songs serenading her. It had served its purpose in enhancing the atmosphere, but now it was corrupting the purity of the haven, forcing her to think about the lyrics. Just as she found the strength to sit up, a ringing coming from beside her made her jump with surprise. The rapid flashing light that matched the pattern of the ring reminded her that she had set her phone next to her head in foolish hopes that her ex-boyfriend would call. Yet, perhaps she was not so foolish after all.

"Hello?" She answered, unsuccessfully forcing her voice to sound as though it wasn't hoarse from crying continuously for the past two hours.

"Hey sweetheart," came a female voice from the phone. It was Amelia.

Sophia froze. She had not expected a call from one of the girls.

"Hello?" Amelia said after a moment of silence.

"What do you want?" Sophia said as matter-of-factly as she could.

"You know, your attempt to sound cold only make you sound more cute."

"Fuck you," Sophia said calmly, without a hint of anger in her voice.

"What's your problem?" Amelia said, offended.

"What's my problem? I'll tell what my problem is," Sophia retorted while staring into the nothingness in front of her, "That little stunt you pulled cost me my boyfriend. He never wants to see me again. Or either of you."

"What the fuck? Just cos he passed out at a -"

"I told him."

"You...told him."

"Yes."

"You stupid fuck. What's wrong with you? What did you think would happen if you told him?"

"Maybe..." Sophia paused to mask the tears that were coming back to her now, "maybe relationships mean something to you and little miss whore-toy, but to me they're based on trust." She held her hand over the receiver after saying this to hide the sound of the sobs.

"Trust? What makes you think that just because Estelle and I have a healthy sex life that there isn't any trust involved? That's a hell of an assumption for you to make. And by the way, are we keeping score, because I have a friend who says that your boyfriend and her had -"

"It was only one time!" Sophia yelled before she could stop herself. She added, more calmly, "It was a mistake. He swore he'd never do it again."

"Yeah, well he lied."

Amelia must have known that this statement would cause an extended pause because she made no attempt to break the silence. Sophia's mind tried to process the motive behind this statement. She knew that if she could convince herself that Amelia was lying then she wouldn't have to feel its effects.

"Why would you say that?" Sophia said, returning to her matter-of-fact voice.

"Because it's true."

"No it's not."

"Look, I'm sorry, but I talked to her the other day, and..." Amelia paused, half-expecting to be cut off before she could finish the sentence, "he went over to her house one night when you were studying for finals."

"I have to go."

"Sophia, wait -"

Click.

Sophia made sure to turn the phone off so that she could not receive phone calls at all. The music crept its way back into the front of her mind, but she no longer had the will to get up and turn it off. With the light from her cell phone gone, she found herself once again surrounded by complete darkness. However, the darkness had lost its purity. Nothing was pure anymore. Not the tears that slid down her cheek now, nor the dry sobs that would escape her lips later.

The unmistakable sounds of raw lust could be heard quite clearly through the bedroom window by anyone who passed by. There were a wide array of sounds to be heard, from low, guttural moans to high-pitched squeals of ecstasy. The reactions from passing pedestrians were equally varied. One person stopped and stared, wide-eyed, before breaking into a brisk pace. An older woman refused to show any sings of acknowledgement other than a disapproving snort. A young man considered how unfortunate it was that the blinds were closed before deciding against trying to sneak a peek at the action.

Were he to have succeeded in peering into the bedroom, he would have seen a blonde woman with rather large breasts and thin hips rocking back and forth wildly on an dark-haired man. Sweat glistened from every inch of their bodies, as though they had kept up this pace all afternoon. The look on the woman's face was one of fierce determination. She stared down at her lover, taking great pleasure in knowing that he loved every second of what she was doing to him. She knew that the trick of using her muscles inside her pussy to squeeze his cock as it thrust in and out rapidly would have the desired effect on him.

"You like that baby?" Kaylin said with complete confidence that she knew the answer.

"Oh fuck yeah! Oh...you're gonna make me cum!" Trevor responded breathlessly.

"Fuck yeah I am! Cum for me baby!" She said as she watched his face with wicked satisfaction. 

Trevor grabbed the corners of the pillow under his head while pushing his head back. His eyes were clenched tight and his breath was trapped in his lungs for several seconds. Kaylin felt the pressure of his hips dig into hers and she knew that he had just come. She continued to gyrate her hips on his hard cock slowly while he suddenly gasped for air.

She made sure to keep him inside her as she spoke, "now, isn't that better than that bitch you used to go out with?"

"Oh God, she doesn't even compare to you."

After she was sure that he felt the last of the orgasm's aftershocks, Kaylin slid off of Trevor's body and lied down next to him on the bed. She took her fingers and lightly scraped her nails across his chest, occasionally running over a nipple.

"You know, I know exactly how you feel," Kaylin spoke softly, "in fact, that whore Amelia stole my girlfriend from me, too."

"You were with that other one?" Trevor turned his head to ask, confused, "so then...you were a lesbian?"

This caused Kaylin to roll her eyes and reply in mock surprise, "Oh shit! You mean you're not a chick? I thought this was a strap-on!" she said while grabbing his penis and waving it back and forth.

Trevor gave her a look that made her pause in mid-swing. "I'm bisexual," she stated simply. "got a problem with that?" she continued as she took her thumb and forefinger and rubbed the head of his cock.

"Mmm, no I don't think I do," Trevor replied as his eyelids fell slightly.

Kaylin grinned slyly as she tightened her grip just a little and began stroking. "You wanna get back at her?"

Trevor paused for a moment before answering, "How?"

"Well, you could start by fucking me again."
