 Welcome to the exciting Adventures of Chase Cooder - Bush Pilot! This offering is far different from my other stories. The kernels of a thin plot took hold, character development took shallow root and...Chase Cooder â€“ Bush Pilot! was born. But before we depart, I want to give a heartfelt thanks to Stella Omega for her early support and encouragement, to AsylumSeeker for his invaluable editing advice, and to Teschan for his insightful fine tuning. Are you ready? Well, climb aboard, buckle up and enjoy the ride!
