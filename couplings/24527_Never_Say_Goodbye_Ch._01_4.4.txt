 Here is the first chapter of my work on The story with Jakobi and Aiden. It focuses mainly on character development and the suspense of the two reconnecting. More to come (hopefully)

The bright glow of the stadium was like a firefly in the distance. She sucked in a deep breath, stepping out of the truck and locking the door behind her. How long had it been since she'd even been on this campus? Freshman year seemed like a lifetime ago. Here she was a senior, almost an adult, and she was back where she started. Back to square one.

Starting towards the bright speck in the distance, she reflected on the past four years. How quickly they had passed! The Highland campus still felt like home, though she'd only spent a single semester here as a freshman. Long enough to change everything for you, Aiden, she reminded herself.

She had been heartbroken when her parents pulled her out of public school and began homeschooling her after that first semester. High school had been some sort of blessing for her. Aiden had always been the odd girl out, the one that never quite fit. Her first year of high school had changed everything for her. Finally, she had a place where her geeky fun-loving self had a place to fit in and find herself.

Aiden found herself reminiscing as she walked through the campus toward the stadium. How young and na√Øve she had been in her time here... She was a loud, bright teenager, who was ready to take on the big bad world at fourteen. At the thought of that now, her eighteen year old self had to laugh at her youthful innocence.

Her fond memories were not the only thing that drew her back, not by a long shot.

Especially not tonight.
