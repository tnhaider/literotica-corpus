 I rap my knuckles one, two, three on the open door. Bodhi looks away from Judge Judy on the ceiling-mounted TV and beams at me.

"Hey, girl! You like my new digs?"

I run over and jump on the hospital bed. He groans and pulls me in close for a kiss.

"Oof, go easy on me. The drugs aren't that good."

"Sorry, sorry." I kiss the tip of his nose. "Maybe you have a high tolerance."

"Ha, probably. Is a little fentanyl too much to ask?"

"Don't even."

I touch the thick white cast covering his entire leg up to his thigh. It's hard and papery at the same time.

"You have to be more careful! Who's going to carry the groceries now?"

"Could've been worse. My bike is wrecked."

"I don't care about your dumb bicycle. I care about you."

"It was a Proline!"

"Yeah, yeah. By the way, I brought candy and iTunes gift cards. You're welcome."

"Aw, thank you sweetie! I'm only going to be here a couple days, though."

"That's a long time to be stuck in bed. Now you have provisions."

Bodhi takes my hands in his and kisses me again. 

"Wanda just made her rounds. We're all alone."

"Won't she be mad if I get your heart rate up?"

"I like to live dangerously."

"Obviously."

I look to the flimsy blue curtain bisecting the room. Bodhi follows my gaze.

"He's passed out. He got the good stuff."

"You drive a hard bargain..."

"Yes I do."

I quietly close the door and lean over the bed. I touch Bodhi's neck and give him a slight smile.

"Nurse Julissa is gonna make you feel all better."

I put my hands on the side of his face and kiss him deeply. He starts to unbutton my blouse while we make out. I sit back down on the bed and put my leg on top of his good one. I grind my pussy against his thigh.

Bodhi kisses my cleavage and caresses my breasts over my bra. I rub his pecs, suck his earlobe. I stop when I hear rustling on the other side of the divider. The other guy snores and we resume. 

I take a small bottle of juniper-scented lotion out of my purse and squirt it into my palm.

"What are you going to do with that?"

I slip my hand under his hospital gown and slide it up and down his shaft. I play with the smooth barbell at the head of his cock. Bodhi unbuttons my shirt the rest of the way and snaps the front of my bra open. I clench my fist tighter.

"Mmm. I like that."

"Yeah you do."

"You're making me feel so much better..."

Bodhi kisses my shoulder, plays with my nipples. He leans into me and breathes heavily into my ear. I move my thumb around as I jerk him off. He pushes up my pencil skirt and fingers me through my underwear.

"Get on top of me."

"No! I don't want to break you."

"I'm tough. Hop on up."

"Babe! Your leg is in a sling!"

"Eh. I've had worse."

"Do I want to know?"

"Probably not."

I hike my skirt up all the way and carefully straddle him. I put my arms around his shoulders. He slides in easily, and I shiver as he enters me. I bury my face in his neck. 

Bodhi moves slowly inside me. We try to keep still to keep the bed from shaking. 

"How's your leg? Does it hurt?"

He kisses me again.

"Not a bit."

Bodhi holds my hips as I gently rock bath and forth. He leans his head back against the pillow and moans quietly. I clench tightly around his cock. He grips my ass. I plant my hands on his chest.

"You can go harder."

"This bed is about to snap in half." I kiss his forehead. "Besides, this is nice."

"Yeah. It is."

He kisses my chest. I hold his head close. His breath is hot on my skin. 

"We should finish," I say. "Someone's going to see us."

"And?"

"I don't really care either."

I pick up the pace just a bit. The bed creaks. I lick my finger and tease my clitoris. 

"I'm close. How should I..."

"Cum inside me."

"Are you sure?"

"Yeah."

He kisses me hard, crushing my arm between us. I bite his lower lip. He pulls my hair. I rub myself harder.

"I'm cumming," I pant. "Are you ready?"

"Fuck yeah."

Bodhi shudders and climaxes too. Cum drips out of me and onto his leg. He passes me tissues and I lie back down. I kiss his chest and cuddle up next to him. He squeezes my arm and picks up the remote.

"Maury?" 

"Do you even need to ask? Let's see who the father is."
