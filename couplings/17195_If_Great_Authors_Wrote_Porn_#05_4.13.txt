 If Great Authors Wrote Porn #05 Shakespeare, The Merchant of Venice

AUTHOR'S NOTE: Many scholarly theses have been written on the subject of Shakespearean bawdry. The Bard of Avon was no prude and sprinkled rude jokes through his plays for the edification of the audience in the pit. However, the majority of them are obscure to the modern reader because of changes in vulgar slang over the centuries. Herewith I offer my humble imagination of how he might write porn for the modern mind. I have no doubt it will be the subject of much criticism as even the original has over the centuries. 

ACT IScene I A Street in Venice.

(Enter ANTONIO and Bassanio, in conversation)

ANTONIOWell, tell me now what lady is the sameTo whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,To bring her pussy's sweetness soft to bedThat you to-day promised to tell me of?

BASSANIOOf all of men who chase the fairest flowerThat ever women hid between their legs,I owe the most, in money and in love,And from your love I have a warrantyTo unburden all my plots and purposesHow to get clear of all the debts I owe.

ANTONIOI pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;And if it stand, as yet your cock still doesTo pierce the depth of this maid's pussy sweet,My purse, my person, my extremest means,Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.

BASSANIOIn Belmont is a lady richly left;And she is fair, and so doth have such boobs,Of wondrous virtue: sometimes from her eyesI did receive fair speechless messages:Her name is Portia, nothing undervaluedTo Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:Nor is the wide world ignorant of her cunt,For the four winds blow in from every coastHard cocked suitors, and her sunny hairLies fair upon her pussy down below.O my Antonio, had I but the meansTo hold my cock along with one of them,I have a mind presages me such thrift,That I should questionless be fucking her anon!

ANTONIOThat shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,To furnish thee to Portia's boobs and ass.Go, presently inquire, and so will I,Where money is, and I no question makeTo have it of my trust or for my sake.

(Exeunt)

SCENE II Portia's bedchamber

PORTIAThe length of a cock may be the measure of a man,But this reasoning is not in the fashion tochoose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I mayneither choose which cock I like nor dislike;so is the will of a daughter's pussy curbedby the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,Yea, as hard as the cocks which do stand waiting for me,Jessica, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?

JESSICAMy father Shylock is a Jew and a money-lender;And yet tween you and me true friendship grows.As our fathers were different so are we alike.My father is strict and allows me no cock to seek.Your father was ever virtuous; therefore the lottery,that his will devised in these three cloths of gold,silver and linen, whereof who chooses your pussyshall have thy troth. But those whose cocks drive them,these princely suitors that are already herethough here they have not yet come,what now, when do they hazard a choice?

PORTIAI pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namestthem, I will describe their rods; and, according to mydescription, level at my affection.

JESSICAFirst, there is the Moorish prince.

PORTIAAy, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing buttalk of his horse; and vaunts it about that he ise'en so hung himself. I am much afeard my lady hismother was fucked by a blacksmith.

JESSICAThen how likes thou the Count of Arragon?

PORTIAVery vilely in the morning, when he is sober, andmost vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: whenhe arises his shaft is hard and he doth piss it away, andwhen he is drunk it doth fall so low I cannot find it.He is little better than a beast:and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shallmake shift to not be fucked by him.

JESSICAIf he should offer to choose, and choose the rightcloth, you should refuse to perform your father'swill, if you should refuse to give him your cunt.

PORTIAIf I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die aschaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the mannerof my father's will. Therefore, for fear of the worst,set a deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary drape,for if the devil be within and that temptationwithout, I know he will choose it rather than my pussy.

JESSICAAnd Bassiano, he who makes the thirdTo lust to taste thy cunt juice, lady?

PORTIANow of the lot, methinks he pleases best,If only his prick does have the length ofthose lonesome shanks, and if only hispurse did have the length of his prick,then should I wish that he may endeavorto lift the cloth that doth my pussy hide.

(Enter a Serving-man)

How now! what news?

SERVANTTonight, Madam, they shall make their choices.

(Exit serving man)

PORTIASo tonight is my pussy to be displayed for allAnd hard cocks to make play to enter itBy this auction of choosing cloths.

(Exeunt)

SCENE III. Venice. A public place.

(Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK )

SHYLOCKThree thousand ducats; well.

BASSANIOAy, sir, for three months. For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.

SHYLOCKAntonio shall become bound; well.

BASSANIOMay you stead me? will you say me yes? shall Iknow your answer?

SHYLOCKAntonio is a good man. Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is agood man is to have you understand me that he issufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I maytake his bond. I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?

(Enter ANTONIO)

BASSANIOThis is Signior Antonio.

SHYLOCKThis kindness will I show.Go with me to a notary, seal me thereYour single bond; and, in a merry sport,If you repay me not on such a day,In such a place, such sum or sums as areExpress'd in the condition, let the forfeitBe nominated for an equal poundOf your fair flesh, to be cut off and takenFrom the very end of your fine Christian cock.

ANTONIOContent, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bondAnd say there is much kindness in the Jew.

BASSANIOYou shall not seal to such a bond for me:I'll rather dwell in my necessity.Portia's cunt spread on my couch I long to seeBut not so much to take thy cock from thee.

ANTONIOCome on: in this there can be no dismay;My ships come home a month before the day.And when my well filled ship lies at the dockHe shall never have his pound from off my cock.

(Exeunt)

ACT II

SCENE I Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

(Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO and his train; JESSICA, and others attending )

MOROCCOMislike me not for my complexion,The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.The best-regarded virgins of our climeHave loved it too: I would not change this hue,Except to steal the pussy of fair Portia.

JESSICAGo into the bedroom now and discoverThere several curtains, oh my noble prince.Now make your choice.

MOROCCOThe first, of gold, who this inscription bears,'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'The second, silver, which this promise carries,'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'This third, plain linen, with warning all as blunt,'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'How shall I know if I do choose the right?

JESSICAWell shall you know, my lord, by Portia's pussyfound behind the curtain. I doubt not you will know it.

MOROCCOWhat many men desire? Shall I try the gold?O sinful thought! Never so rich a gemWas set in worse than gold. They have in EnglandA coin that bears the figure of an angelStamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;Behind the cloth of gold, what I desire must lie.

JESSICAThere, open it, prince; and if her cunt is there,Then she is yours. Raise the cloth but as highas your girdle, and feel what doth ensue beneath.

(He raises the cloth of gold.)

MOROCCOWhat! Whose hands are these that grasping my crotchDo draw me under the cloth so fair? Forsooth, my tights are down,And my cock springs forth ready. Can she abide its length,its girth, its thrusting force? Soft around it I feel wet and warm.But hold, is this a pussy here? What tickles the tip of my rod,So like a busy tongue? Methinks behind the cloth of gold,Soft lips enwrap my cock and take it deep. No fair slit here,But a blow job strong is my reward. Ah, suck and suck,Fair maid, and with thy hands stroke the shaft even as thy mouthDoes take it deep and warm. And faster speed, upwards, down,Until I shoot my juices thus, Aha, I come! And so am spent.But now from soft hands a parchment's giv'n me. Now let me read.

(Reads)

"All that glitters is not gold;Often have you heard that told:Many a man his life hath soldBut a fair cunt to behold:But let soft lips your cock enfold.Had you been as wise as bold,Your answer had not been inscroll'd:Fare you well; your suit is cold."

(Pulling up his tights)

Cold, indeed; and labour lost:Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!Portia, adieu. I have too soft a prickTo take a tedious leave: thus losers part.

(Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets)

(The curtain opens and Portia, unclothed, looks out.)

PORTIAA gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.Let all of his complexion choose me so.

(Exeunt)

SCENE II. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

(Enter JESSICA to PORTIA, nude on the bed)

JESSICAQuick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,And comes to his election presently.

(Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON with his train)

JESSICABehold, there are the curtains, noble prince:If you choose that wherein her pussy lies,Straight shall you nuptial rites be solemnized:But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,You must be gone from hence immediately.

ARRAGON

Now to my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and linen white.'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.What says the golden sheet? ha! let me see:'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'What many men desire! that 'many' may be meantBy the fool multitude, that choose by show,I will not choose what many men desire,And rank me with the ass licking multitudes.Why, then to thee, thou silver curtain fair;Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'I will take what I deserve. That curtain I will lift,For my cock throbs to feel what it deserves.

(He lifts the silver curtain)

Soft are the hands that pull my cock inside,Now it does find a place to rest also soft,But not so warm and wet that pussy it might be.I think her boobs do now enfold my shaft,And a tit job my reward 'neath silver cloth.Ay, there's the rub, between those soft mounds fair,And nipples hard do tickle the tip of my shaftWhile it works its way into that soft valley.Now rolls around, now thrusts, now throbs, and yet againMoves back and forth with pleasure in each nerve.Ay, hard grasp it and firmly press each boob,As I jerk forth and back and reach my peak.And now between soft tits I climb the height,And milky boobs appear from what I loose.So fine, so fair, so soft, but cunt they never be.I came, I looked, anon I came again, and lost.

What is here? A parchment. I shall read.

(Reads)

"I fear that thou did choose amiss.Some there be that titties kiss;Such have but a boob job's bliss:There be fools alive, I wis,Silver'd o'er; and so was this."

(Exeunt Arragon and train)

PORTIAThus hath the candle singed the moth.O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.

JESSICAThe ancient saying is no heresy,Hanging and screwing goes by destiny.

PORTIACome, draw the curtain, Jessica.

ACT III

SCENE I. Venice. A street.

(Enter SALANIO and SALARINO )

SALANIONow, what news on the Rialto?

SALARINOWhy, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hatha ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;And I fear with his ship being wrecked,So is his fortune lost and with it his cock also.Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross myprayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.

(Enter SHYLOCK)

How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?

SHYLOCKYou know, none so well, none so well as you, of mydaughter Jessica's flight. She has gone to Portiaso each may find some strange dick strong enoughto penetrate their virginities.

SALARINO(aside) And even now she makes the beast with two backswith that Gratiano who has stolen her pussy.

(To Shylock) But tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had anyloss at sea or no?

SHYLOCKThere I have another bad match: a bankrupt, aprodigal, who dare scarce show his head on theRialto; let him look to his cock: he was wont tocall me usurer; I shall call him as a woman cut.

SALARINO

Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not takehis dick: what's that good for?

SHYLOCKTo bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,it will feed my revenge. He hates me because I am a Jew. Hathnot a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, a cock,dimensions, senses, passions? If you prick us, do we not bleed?If you jerk our dick, do we not come? and if you wrong us, shall we notrevenge? I shall go and fee me an officer; Iwill have the cock of him, if he forfeit; for, werehe out of Venice, I can make what merchandise Iwill.

(Exeunt)

SCENE II. Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.

(Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, JESSICA and Attendants )

BASSANIOLet me chooseFor as I am, my cock lives hard and throbs.But let me to my fortune and the curtains.

PORTIAAway, then! I spread my pussy 'hind one of them:If you do love me, you will find me out.Jessica and the rest, stand all aloof.Let music sound while he doth make his choice.

(exit Portia)

BASSANIOCloth of gold, and silver bright, and then of linen pure.Gold ornament is but the guiled shoreTo a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarfVeiling an Indian beauty's boobs; Therefore, thou gaudy gold,Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;Nor none of thee, silver pale and common drudge'Tween man and maid: but thou, thou linen white,Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;And here choose I; joy be the consequence!

(raises the linen curtain.)

What find I here? Fair Portia's slit indeed?Nay, I fear a beard I feel. Not Portia but a man?Though a youth's mouth may give a man his peak,Yet bearded elder never pleases my cock.But stay, what man hath a beard so soft and fine?Here between her legs the spider hath wovenA golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men.'Neath curly hairs I find two sweet lips,But set not like a mouth. Now do they kissand now they suck in my cock.Tis true warm wet depths I have found,And as I thrust my cock into this cuntI know that truly Portia I now fuck.Her hips she twists and holds my cock so tightI thrust in deep and do enjoy its rise.Moan, Portia, moan as I do swivven theeAnd now cry out as hard we come together.

(he falls exhausted across Portia's body)

But what writing she hands me now?

(reads)

"You that choose not by the view,Chance as fair and choose as true!Since this pussy falls to you,Be now content and seek no new,If you be well pleased with thisAnd thrust your cock thus for your bliss,Turn you where your lady isAnd claim her pussy with a kiss."

JESSICAMy lord and lady, it is now our time,That have stood by and seen you both well pleasured,To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!

GRATIANOMy lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,I wish you all fucking that you can wish;For I am sure that I do wish it too:And when your honours mean to solemnizeThe bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,Even at that time I may be married too.

BASSANIOWith all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.

GRATIANOI thank your lordship, you have got me one.My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:You saw her pussy, I beheld her friend's;You fucked there, and as you did I fucked her here.No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.I got a promise of this fair one hereTo have her pussy, provided that your fortuneAchieved her friend's cunt so well.

BASSANIOOur feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.

GRATIANOWe'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.

PORTIABut if that's the game, Jessica, we must fuck often and well.I think that even now we must begin this race.

(Exeunt)

SCENE III A room in Portia's house

(Enter Portia and Bassiano, and Jessica and Gratiano, but partly dressed)

PORTIAWhat now, Jessica, I fear thy boobs do show throughthat scanty fabric that thou display. It makes me eventhink you have sported through the night.And truly, that cloth wound round his hipsdoth scarcely conceal the cock thou lovest.

JESSICAAnd thou, Portia, doth show thy lovely legs evenup until that nest of golden hair that he so loves.I think he has sported in fair pastures the whole night long,but now his prick is worn and used and not upstanding.

(enter a servant)

BASSIANOWhat, interrupt our sport? Hath thou no heart?

SERVANTI did, my lord;And I have reason for it. Signior AntonioCommends him to you.

(Gives Bassanio a letter. Bassiano reads.)

PORTIAThere are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:

BASSIANOBut is it true, my man?Have Antonio's ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?

SERVANTNot one, my lord.And the Jew doth demand his bond, even his pound of fleshto be cut off from Antonio's long Christian cock.

JESSICAWhen I was with him I have heard him swearThat he would rather have Antonio's prickThan twenty times the value of the sum.It will go hard with poor Antonio.

PORTIAWhat sum owes he the Jew?

BASSANIOFor me three thousand ducats.

PORTIAWhat, no more?Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;Double six thousand, and then treble that,Before a friend of this descriptionShall lose his dick through Bassanio's fault.O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!And Gratiano you must with him too.

BASSANIOSince I have your good leave to go away,I will make haste: but, till I come again,No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,No pussy interposer 'twixt us twain,My cock will spurt itself only in thy cunt.Come, Gratiano, let us be dressed and off.

(Exeunt Bassiano and Gratiano)

PORTIACome on, Jessica; I have work in handThat you yet know not of: we'll see our husbandsBefore they think of us.

JESSICAShall they see us?

PORTIAThey shall, Jessica; but in such a habit,That they shall think we are accomplishedWith dicks we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,When we are both accoutred like young men,I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,And wear my stiff rod with the braver grace.
