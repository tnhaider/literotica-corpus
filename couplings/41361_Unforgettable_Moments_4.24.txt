 Author's Note: The very first comment on my first published story was from an enigmatic Literotarian appellationed madalice. She avered a fetish for blowjobs and offered the following challenge to those who perused her Biography tab.

Married, monogamous, occasionally bored and wanting to hear and ONLY hear what you would like to do if you were in a dark room with me on my knees in front of you and you had 20 minutes to do whatever you wanted before you had to leave. Not interested in meeting, emailing, or chatting, just want to hear your fantasies.

I wrote the following story in response to her challenge. When it was published I contacted her to tell her what I'd done. I never heard from her. Not once. But I still think of her fondly from time to time.
