 "Can't believe she's done this," I muttered after putting my phone back.

"What's up?" my cousin asked and I gave him the look.

"That clingy ex again?" Jess chimed in. She was nursing her baby, and she looked over at Chris with a quizzical look.

"Yeah," I responded with a roll of my eyes and a sigh of exasperation. She pat my hand gingerly, and I smiled at her.

"She hasn't met me, has she?" Jess asked with a smile. I shook my head and she piped up with, "I'm happy to pretend to be your girlfriend to make her jealous."

I nodded along with a smile, then I got an idea. Jess was a petite, but tall girl, while Megan, the ex, was on the shorter side, and was more than a tad overweight. She'd never have let me talk to someone who looked like Jess while we were together, she was way too insecure. The seeds were definitely planted now.

"Hey, how serious are you about that?" I asked her with an evil glint in my eye.
