Music

Krager slammed the dressing room door, laid his guitar in its case, grabbed an energy drink and slumped on the couch. He drained the bottle, sweat pouring from him. 'What a show, they really went wild tonight', he thought, the cheers and screams still ringing in his ears.

A soft tapping on the door evoked a curt "Yeah, what is it" as he sat up.

A pretty blonde girl of about eighteen years opened the door, smiled and said "Your drummer told me you'd sign my autograph book."

He nodded, seeing her eyes focused on his bulging crotch.

Music

Music should make you want to move. Perhaps a simple bob of the head in time to the beat, tapping your fingers or your toes as the song plays, or wild gyrations of your air guitar on the stage in that imaginary amphitheatre you headline in. A few songs carry with them the compulsion to dance, to glide across the room, held tight in a warm embrace. This song makes me want to feel your hands caressing me along with the guitar's chords, to feel you deep inside me, thrusting hard, in rhythm with the pulsing beat of the drum.

Music

Joe and Monica met at the Freshman Get Acquainted Dance. The chemistry was immediate. When the music changed to slow songs and the lights dimmed, they danced to an exit and slipped outside. Kissing passionately, they removed their clothing, the contact of their skins exciting. Shoulders braced against the wall, Joe lifted Monica and she guided his erect cock into her moist pussy. They moved in time with the music, tongues swirling. Monica tightened her grip and whispered, "I'm cumming." Joe erupted in her as she orgasmed, their ecstatic cries echoing across the campus. "Faithfully" would become 'their' song after that.

Music

She swayed slightly, eyes almost closed as the music from the band washed over her, drenching her in harmony. Her pulse echoed the steady pounding rhythm of the drums. The thrumming of the melody sang in her veins. She'd been watching him all night. She walked to the bandstand, the guitar player's chords pulling her forward until she stopped just inches from the bright stage lights. His eyes locked with hers, and for a brief moment his moving hands stilled, the music stopped and she felt the warmth of them on her body, a prelude of the night to come.

Cars

"And this one's third," he said patiently, guiding her hand into the proper position. "Easy does it."

"Like this?" she asked, forgetting to engage the clutch.

"No," he sighed. "You didn't push in the clutch. Try again."

She made another attempt, missing second and accidentally putting it into reverse instead of third.

"No," he sighed. "You didn't push in the clutch. Try again."

She made another attempt, missing second and accidentally putting it into reverse instead of third.

"I'm really glad we decided to practice shifting here at Lookout Point, instead of on the road."

"Me, too," she agreed. She'd learned to drive a stick shift sitting on her daddy's lap. A few more "errors" and he'd give up and they could practice their "parking" techniques.

Cars

Cheryl and I spent many warm summer evenings in the last row of the Moonlight Drive-In. It didn't matter what was playing, we were in the back seat. We'd undress and lick and suck each other. I'd slide between her legs and she'd gather me in, our sweaty bodies rocking together. We both cried out as we came. If others heard, we didn't care. Afterwards we would cuddle and talk about our future. The Moonlight opened last night after ten years. Guess where we were? In the SUV's back seat. In the last row. We still cry out too. 

-----

Cars

Since his breakup with Jerry, Phil was too distraught to have his Jeep serviced until today. The mechanic was handsome. A look passed between them. Phil winked. It was returned. In the Service Lounge the mechanic motioned to follow him. Entering a store room he said, "I'm Rob" and unzipped his coverall. Phil sucked Rob's cock then pulled down his pants and bent over. Rob lubed them and entered Phil with one thrust. Pumping hard, Rob shot his load as Phil spurted in Rob's callused hand.

"Now I know why they call you mechanics 'grease monkeys' said Phil. 

Rob laughed.

Cars

"Wait'll your parents see my Corvette," Randy said. 

"They'll wonder what it cost," Rita replied. "Why are we doing this? No sex for a week."

Randy laughed, "They don't know we're living together?"

"No," Rita sighed. "Gonna miss this," she said, rubbing Randy's cock.

He swung onto a dirt road and stopped. "Let's fuck," he cried. They stripped and she leaned over the car's hood. He thrust eagerly into her from behind, rubbing her clit as she pushed back against him. He shot his load as she climaxed.

"Nice car," her father remarked. "Hood's smeared. Needs waxin'. What's so funny?" 

-----

Clothing

Panties. She had dozens of them, strewn like a silken rainbow across her bed. She needed to decide which ones to wear tonight. Red lace? Black satin? Thong? Bikini? Boy shorts? The pink ones and the white lace ones had matching bras, but she wouldn't be wearing one with that dress. The violet silk ones were her favorites, but he'd seen those. She glanced at the clock.

Yikes! He'd be here any minute. Finally she made her decision and slid her dress over her head.

She whispered to her date as they finished their dessert. "I'm not wearing any panties."

-----

Clothing

Red "Fuck Me" pumps. Damn! He was rock hard and all he'd seen was her shoes as she stepped over the threshold of the elevator. He glanced down again and saw trim ankles encased in silk stockings. With those sexy seams up the back. He was never going to survive the ride up to his room.

"Thirty." Her voice interrupted his thoughts. He shifted his trench coat to cover his erection and tapped the button. He risked another look. A glimpse of red dress, snug and low cut. His hand yearned to cup the ass he knew was hidden there. 

-----

Clothing

The smell of honeysuckle and night-blooming flowers wafted through the window, heavy in the humid heat. She was sultry, a woman on a vintage paperback's cover. The outline of her legs was silhouetted through her translucent white satin slip. A small silver safety pin held up one of the straps. A fragrant flower was fastened in her hair, just above her left ear. A light sheen of perspiration glowed on her skin, a few drops sliding down the neckline of her slip and disappearing between her breasts. The fan oscillated on the dresser, blowing the slip tight against her body.

Clothing

Beth moved through the racks of skimpy lingerie. She had never shopped at Victoria's Secret before. 

"Hi, I'm Megan. Can I help you?" a salesgirl asked. Beth nodded.

Carrying bras and panties, Beth followed Megan to a dressing room. She watched as Beth undressed and tried things on. Their eyes met and Beth smiled shyly. Megan embraced her and they kissed. Megan stripped and they licked and fingered each other. Megan sucked Beth's pussy until she orgasmed. Beth licked Megan's pussy until she came on her face. They dressed and exchanged phone numbers. Soon they were inseparable, and no longer wore underwear. 

-----

Summer

She was eating peaches when he first saw her. Her mouth was sticky and shiny with the juice from the fruit. She licked her fingers one by one and then turned the page of the book she was reading. The striped canvas hammock swayed as her foot pushed against the ground, sending it gently swinging again and again. Bees buzzed around her, gathering nectar from the fragrant honeysuckle vines. Their steady drone a counterpart to the music quietly playing from the nearby boom box. She smiled, holding the last slice of peach up to his mouth. 

"Want a bite?"

Summer

"This is my secret fishing spot," said Mike, dropping the anchor. "I've caught some mighty big ones here."

"It's beautiful and so peaceful," Lisa replied.

"Just us and the fish, baby doll."

"Not so fast," Lisa said with a grin. "Your fishing widow wants some lovin' first." She removed her shirt revealing firm, brown-nippled breasts. Mike undressed hurriedly.

They made love, took a swim, made love again and lay naked in the warm summer sun.

"I think I caught the big one today," Lisa giggled, stroking Mike's chest.

"That's because you had the right bait," he replied, kissing her.

-----

Summer

In the waning days of summer, Roger and Debbie took a final cruise on the lake. The air was warm, but some leaves had already turned. They anchored, opened the wine and lay on the deck. They undressed, kissing passionately, Roger sucking her nipples as she pumped his throbbing cock. Debbie sighed as he entered her and they began a smooth rocking rhythm. His hands gripped her ass as her soaked pussy clenched his pounding hardness. In a glorious release, Debbie orgasmed as Roger spurted his cum. A month later they confirmed Debbie's pregnancy. They named their daughter Summer.

Summer

Heather and Tiffany dove in the secluded darkness of the camp pond. Everyone else was asleep and they slipped out for some fun. As counselors, they were earning money for college. Climbing on the raft, Heather impulsively kissed Tiffany who returned it eagerly. Heather's finger wiggled in Tiffany's pussy as Tiffany sucked Heather's nipples. Tiffany's tongue drove Heather wild until she came in her friend's mouth. Heather sucked Tiffany's pussy until she erupted in Heather's mouth. After more orgasms they swam to shore and crept into their cabin. They had arrived at camp as friends and returned to college as lovers.

Flying

She dreamt she was flying. He slept on beside her, his body against hers. He stirred and in that hazy state between sleep and wakefulness, began to caress her. His hands stroked her breasts, the nipples beading at his touch. Fingers dipped low onto her belly and into her moist center. His lips kissed the side of her neck, sending shivers down her spine. Slowly, slowly he entered her, fingers toying with her clit. She awoke as her body responded to his touch.

"I dreamt I was flying," she murmured drowsily. And then she flew, taking him along with her. 

-----

Flying

"I'm not sure, Rick. What if we get caught?"

"We won't be. Go on. I'll be there in a minute."

Lori eased into the planes cramped bathroom and slipped off her panties.

Two knocks and Rick was there, jeans and briefs around his ankles.

He thrust eagerly into Lori's warm wetness, her legs around his waist.

They rocked back and forth, her pussy gripping his cock like a velvety fist.

Joyfully they came together, cries muffled by a passionate kiss.

When Rick opened the door, a flight attendant was standing there.

"Welcome to the Mile High Club," she said winking.

-----

Flying

Rhienna banked over the rocky crags, powerful wings lifting her easily. She had never traveled north before. A shadow passed over and she turned to see a male. He swooped down and flew alongside, smiling.

"I am Parth."

"Rhienna. Fair winds, Parth."

"Fair winds, Rhienna. What do you seek?"

"A mate. It is my time."

She turned and spread her legs. Their bodies met and they kissed. He entered her and they spiraled upwards, hips moving smoothly, their ecstatic cries ringing among the peaks. They mated twice more and flew joyously among the clouds. Now, only death would separate them.

-----

Flying

Bruce stretched and yawned. He turned on the bed of pine boughs and looked at Shelley sleeping. It was a miracle they had landed safely among the trees, the wings shearing off as a clogged fuel line marooned them in the wild. Using their wits, they survived. Bathing in a stream, the current swept them together and desire took hold. Trying to outdo each other in the ingenuity of their lovemaking, they fell asleep each night exhausted. Becoming lean on a natural diet and brown from the sun, they hid from search planes. They didn't need rescue. Not yet anyway. 

-----

Night

He stretched out on the hammock, one foot over the side, lazily pushing, one hand reaching down for the can of beer he'd swiped on the way out. It was full dark now. Dark enough that he could stroke himself and not worry about any unwelcome eyes. He watched her bedroom window across the wide expanse of yard, his body hardening at the sight of her sweet young body, silhouetted against the filmy curtains. The lights went out and he couldn't see her any longer. 

"What took you so long?" he asked.

"I took off my panties," his wife replied. 

-----

Night

The thumping bass notes made Susan's body quiver as she sipped her drink. 'I feel so out of place. 42 years old. Divorced. But I'm so lonely.'

Offers of drinks and dances were refused. No one intrigued her.

Discouraged, she rose to leave when a voice said "I have been watching you all evening." She turned to see blue eyes and a welcoming smile.

Then they were dancing, moving to the music, bodies close as their lips met. All at once it seemed so right.

Susan sighed as Beth nuzzled her neck. She would not go home alone this night.

-----

Night

Hand in hand they walked onto the deck, night air cool on their bodies, the lapping waves soothing. How long had it been? Months that seemed like years since they were together. Lying on the blankets; lips met, hands caressed, bodies molded. Slowly, sweetly, they began the rhythms of lovemaking, the unity of their flesh and their souls. Tears of happiness glistened in her eyes as he entered her. His heart sang as she clasped him to her and in her. So hard, so wet, so wonderful, their cries of joyful release echoed over the water. They were complete again.

-----

Night

Gary tossed fitfully in bed, the night breezes cool on his skin. He couldn't stop thinking of her. Why couldn't she tell how much he loved her? A soft whispered "Shhhhhh," and she embraced him. Their lips met as suppressed desires exploded. Stroking and caressing, they explored each other. She moaned as his throbbing cock filled her juicy pussy, pink walls gripping throbbing flesh. An open-mouthed kiss stifled their ecstatic cries of mutual release.

Cuddling in the afterglow, he murmured, "I've wanted you for so long."

"I know," Michelle purred. "I love you Gary."

"I love you too, sis."

Games

"No, Mom. I'm not going to the bars every night."

"Your turn, Gina. You're blue." She rolled a seven, moved her piece the number of spaces and knocked Rob back to his home base. Rob unzipped his jeans and tossed them aside.

"Most of the time we stay in and play board games."

"Three for me. Great!" Sam was now totally naked.

"A bunch of us are playing Parcheesi right now. It's my roll. "

Carrie took her turn, smiling as she unfastened her bra.

"Of course. Parcheesi is fun. Bye, Mom."

"But Coed Strip Parcheesi is even more fun."

Games

"That's four Aces ladies," Bill said. "Let's see some flesh."

Samantha, Anne and Megan smiled at each other. They knew why they agreed to play strip poker with their husbands. Removing their bras and panties, they chose a different partner, undressing them and sucking their cocks. Bill took Anne from behind, Samantha impaled herself on Fred's hardness and Megan rode Bob's thick meat. They traded partners again for another round of fucking, finally finishing with their own husbands. Thus began The Saturday Night Poker Club, the subtle pun never failing to make them chuckle when it was mentioned in conversation. 

-----

Games

They adored sex games. Role playing, rape scenarios, all were exciting. Sexually adventurous, no act was taboo, enjoying their bodies and the extent to which they could take them for pleasure. One tied to the bed, the other the ravisher; helplessness bringing overwhelming delight. The night with the scarves was the best so far. He came with blinding intensity as he gasped for air. Then it was her turn. Her orgasms went on and on until she collapsed.

The cell door clanged open. "Peterson, exercise time," said the guard.

He sighed. If only he hadn't pulled the scarf so tight.

-----

Games

Allison ran happily down the hall. She loved playing Hide-and-Seek with her best friends. She ducked into a closet as Bill ran by calling her name. When he was gone she ran upstairs and hid under a bed. She heard someone enter the room and held her breath.

A hand grabbed her ankle and pulled. It was Cheryl!

"Tag, you're it."

They rolled on the bed, kissing and stroking, until their husbands ran in. They fucked each other's husband, then their own, then turned to each other. Allison and Cheryl were in love, but not with their husbands.

-----

Lipstick

Rick took a golf shirt from a hanger, an imprint of Lori's lipstick still on the collar. The memory of that morning returned. They had argued bitterly the night before. He was leaving for his game when she descended the stairs wearing a yellow sundress. They stared and then smiled. She was beautiful. They met halfway, hugging and kissing. Clothes were shed and they made love on the rug, her arms gripping him as he thrust into her. Crying out, they climaxed together. The memory fled as Lori stepped behind him and nuzzled his neck. He would play golf tomorrow.

-----

Lipstick

She was tired of being everyone's buddy. Always the one they thought of for third base on the softball diamond, but never in a back seat parking sort of way. Tonight was going to be different. Tonight everyone was going to know she was a girl.

She started with a tiny red thong. She didn't plan on anyone seeing it, but she'd know it was there. A clingy camisole the same color as her panties followed. She tugged on the denim mini skirt and slipped her feet into her new red sandals. The finishing touch, sparkly lipstick. Red, of course.

-----

Lipstick

"Darn. I forgot my lipstick."

"Here, use mine."

"Cheryl, we need to talk."

"I...I love you."

"I love you, too, Susan. We're friends."

"No. I mean I'm in love with you. I desire you. I want you."

"Susan! I don't know what to say. How long have...?"

"Over a year. Please Cheryl, can I kiss you? Please."

"Ahhh...okay...mmmmmm..."

"Hold me, Cheryl. I've waited so long."

"In the end stall, Susan. Hurry!"

"Ooohh...Cheryl...That feels so good..."

"Susan... Oh, god! Do me harder..."

***

"What's with women and bathrooms?"

"Takes forever. Girl talk probably."

-----

Lipstick

Brian saw a glint between the car's cushions. It was Gloria's lipstick. It must have fallen out last night. She had been eager to have sex, moaning as she rode his cock and he sucked her breasts. Walking up the stairs he heard the sounds of fucking. Opening the door he saw Gloria and Jason on the couch, her legs wrapped around him as he thrust into her. He whistled, then lobbed the lipstick underhand saying, "You forgot this." Ignoring her cries and pleas, he drove away. He headed for town, wanting to return the ring before the jeweler closed. 

-----

Imagination

I hear that song on the radio; you know the one I'm talking about. The one we've both decided is our song. I imagine that look in your eyes, sultry and deep and dark with the promise of what's to come and I write. I imagine your mouth on mine, hot and wet, tongues tangling, and I write. I imagine your hands, calloused and a bit rough, caressing me, sliding and gliding and skimming over my body and I write. I imagine your body, salty and sweaty and hard, on mine, in mine and I write. Oh, how I write.
