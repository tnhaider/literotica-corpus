 Welcome to my first instalment of my Scott MacLean series. I would just like to point that all characters were a figment of my imagination so if any similarities have occurred, it is merely coincidence and completely unintentional. Many thanks to SpongeRob and JoeyS69 for their help and suggestions. Please feel free to comment at the end of the story. All comments are gratefully received, no matter how critical they might be, as it shows that you have taken some time out to read my work.
