 Shannon sighed. The house was quiet now. The children were off to school. Her husband, Ryan, left shortly after the children boarded the school bus. She sat at the dining room table, a cooling cup of coffee beside her and opened the paper. Her eyes skimmed the front page, more bad news. That was the last thing she needed. Shannon flicked the paper open to retrieve the grocery inserts. Her movement was quick and sent the inserts cascading to the floor. She cursed then bent to retrieve them.

She arranged them neatly on the table in front of her by proximity to the house. The last few inserts made her pause. She stared down at a jewelry advertisement. Heart shaped trinkets and semi precious gems gleamed up at her within the Valentine's Day advertisement.

The conversation she had with Ryan the night before came back to her as she looked upon the glossy pamphlet.

"We should probably do something low key this year," Ryan said while pulling his pajama pants on.

"Low key," Shannon repeated with a neutral tone.

Ryan assisted Shannon with removing the accent pillows from the bed. "Yeah. Just you and me. Rent a movie. Kick back at home. Nothing too big or..." 

"Too expensive?" Shannon's neutral tone failed.

Ryan stopped and gave his wife a searching look. "Yes. Too expensive. I want to give you the same sort of gifts I've always given you." Ryan's face filled with worry. "The money's so tight right now."

"You're right." Shannon busied herself with tucking the fitted sheet under the mattress.

Ryan pulled back the sheets but didn't climb into bed. He stood at the bedside and looked at his wife. There was silence for a few moments before Shannon spoke.

"Something simple. We can do simple." Her eyes met Ryan's and she smiled. Ryan returned the smile then climbed into bed.

Shannon tossed the jewelry ad aside then began to work on her grocery list.
