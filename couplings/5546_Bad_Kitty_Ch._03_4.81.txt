 You might ask what the hell a guy like me knows about trying to woo a woman. Believe me, that's exactly what I've been asking myself since I first booted up my lap top this morning, before I'd even had even had my first fix of coffee. Pinching the bridge of my nose, and shaking my head, I can't believe I'm actually going online and looking this stuff up.
