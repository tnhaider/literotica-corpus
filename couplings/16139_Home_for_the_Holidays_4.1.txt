 The airport passenger lounge was beautifully decked out for the season. Garland glittered where it was tacked to the pony walls, Christmas trees stood regally in the corners, and Bing Crosby crooned out 'White Christmas' over the speakers. Outside, snowflakes the size of quarters gently fell in a steady drift, giving the view through the huge picture windows a postcard appearance.

Its intended effect, however, was lost on Sherrie. Christmas was not something she was looking forward to, in fact, she was dreading it. Sitting as far away as she could from the rest of the waiting passengers, Sherrie's thoughts kept going back to the painful events of late.
