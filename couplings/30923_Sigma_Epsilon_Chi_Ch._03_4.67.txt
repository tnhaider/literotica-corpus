 Sigma Epsilon Chi - Marsha 



I was lying across the bed, boning up on Sociology for a test Friday, when I heard the sound of the lock. This wasn't terribly surprising, since Karen or Melanie had been dropping by pretty much every day since I'd signed up as a "mascot" for Sigma Epsilon Chi. Hell, on occasion they'd even dropped by together. But it promised to be damned inconvenient (I couldn't believe I was thinking that!) if they were showing up for some boytoy action right now. I had to study for this test! 

I looked up and whatever I was going to say died in my throat. 

It was Marsha. 

Oh, shit.
