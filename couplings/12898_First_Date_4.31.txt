Eight â€“ The First Date

Rosa had Kathy's dinner ready almost an hour early, prompting Kathy to ask what was going on. Having no idea that her daughter had witnessed her and Dutch frolicking in bed earlier, Rosa was a little flip in answering.

"Got a date."

"With the guy you were screwing this morning?"

"What!"

Kathy blithely ignored her mother and turned a page of People's magazine.

Frozen in time and space, Rosa forced herself to react and firmly said, "Kathy, what did you just say to me?"

The teenager closed the magazine and looked directly at her mother. Her eyes were defiant. "I saw the two of you this morning," she said coldly. 

Rosa recovered well enough to respond, "Did you? Well if I have anything to say about it you'll be seeing a lot more of him."

"Well I hope he has his clothes on when I do," she spat out and ran to her room, slamming the door behind her and fell sobbing on her bed.

Rosa gave her a minute then entered the room. She sat on the edge of the bed and tried to comfort the girl. "Kathy, I didn't mean for you to see us like that. But it happened. We may have something beautiful going. His name is Bob, but he prefers Dutch. We like each other very much and God knows we could use a man around here."

Still full of rebellion, Kathy went for the heart, "Yeah, you were sure using him this morning, mother."

Angered by her daughter's attack, Rosa forgot to be diplomatic and shot back, "He may be moving in with us, so get used to it." Then left the room slamming the door behind her for emphasis, with Kathy's crying ringing in her ears. 

Rosa took a long, hot shower and when she came out she had calmed down and was ready to deal with Kathy, but her daughter remained in her room until Rosa left for her date with Dutch.
