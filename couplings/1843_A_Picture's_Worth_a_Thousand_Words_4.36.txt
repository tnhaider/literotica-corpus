 I'm an independent filmmaker and a photographer, which basically means I'm broke most of the time. I've always been great behind the camera, and terrible at everything else. Luckily I have a lot of friends that like to document their lives. They pay me to take family portraits, wedding pictures and video, I tape their kids' sporting events and put together highlight reels, you name it I do it and I do it well. When it comes to any family oriented event I get the first call when one of my friends wants to document it. For years I've been relying on my close friends to refer me to their friends and so on so that I could make enough money to live somewhat comfortably.

About a year ago I got a call that would change my life and ensure that I live quite comfortably.

My buddy Tom and his wife Lisa were getting close to their ten-year anniversary and Lisa wanted to give Tom a very special gift. She came to my studio, which is in my house, and asked me if we could talk business. I could see that she was nervous so I made small talk for awhile letting her build up to why she was there.

"Tom has been so good to me and I love him so much, I really want to give him a very special anniversary gift. Something that will really show him how much I love him." Lisa said finally.

"Okay, what did you have in mind?" I asked.

"Well, I was kind of hoping that you would be willing to take some very special pictures for me." Lisa said.

"You bet, you know I'm always happy to shoot pictures for you." I said.

"I know you are, it's just that what I have in mind aren't the kind of pictures you usually shoot for us." Lisa said.

"What do you...OH! You mean you want me to take some...for you to give to Tom." I said.

"Yes. I know that you aren't really one of those kind of photographers, but I trust you, and Tom trusts you, so if he gets angry about the pictures at least he can be sure that the photographer was a professional about it." Lisa said.

"Yeah, and then he'll try to kill me." I said.

"Oh no, I don't think you have anything to worry about. I really want to find a way to do this for him. He's always told me that he likes just looking at me and wanted me to show off more so I think he'd love the pictures." Lisa says.

"Just so I know what it is you're really asking, how risqu√© are you wanting these special pictures to be?" I asked.

"I haven't decided that yet. I definitely want some of me in his favorite outfits, like that red dress I wore to your birthday party last week, and since they'd be for him and him alone it wouldn't be that difficult to be a little more revealing." Lisa said.

"Well, you have just over a month until your anniversary to think about what you want to do, but remember I'm not just a photographer, I'm a filmmaker too. If Tom likes to look at you maybe he'd like to watch you put on that red dress, strut around and pose in it then take it off. I'm just throwing that out there, whatever you decide you just let me know and I'll prepare the proper backdrop." I said.

"You're right, he would like to watch me do things, there's one thing in particular that he's always wanted to watch me do that I could never bring myself to do in front of him." Lisa says.

"What's that?" I asked.

"I'm not telling you." Lisa said.

"Okay, I only ask because if you thought you wanted to do it as part of a video for Tom I could set up the remote camera and teach you how to use it so you could do it on your own." I said.

"So you could set it up so I could tape it myself and you wouldn't have to be there while I did what I did?" Lisa asked.

"That's right, you could tape whatever it is you wanted to do in complete privacy. The quality might not be as good as it would with an experienced cameraman, but you could film whatever it was that you were wanting to film, and I could put that piece of film into the final product completely blind so that only Tom would ever see it. The splicing might not be that great without me looking at it to smooth out the transition, but I would never see whatever it was that you did." I said.

"Well, I suppose that it doesn't matter if you know what it would be since you wouldn't see it. Tom has always wanted to watch me masturbate. He's asked me to do it for him many times, and I've tried but the few times I've tried to do it in front of him I've been too embarrassed. That's kind of a personal thing you know." Lisa said.

"I can understand how that could be difficult to do in front of another person. If you decide that you want to...do that on film for Tom I can get you set up to have a nice private session and then I'll splice it in blind and you can take it home to Tom." I said.

"The more we talk about this and the more I think about this the more I want to do a video for him on top of the pictures." Lisa said.

"Figure out what all you want to do and let me know so that I can get all of the necessary equipment in place and we can set a date. I would hope to do it at least a week in advance of your anniversary so that I would have time to edit the film together smoothly and develop the pictures." I said.

Four days later Lisa brought me a list of things she wanted to do and it turned out that she wanted to make a very dirty movie for Tom. On top of modeling his favorite outfits she wanted to model her sexy lingerie, including some new stuff she was buying for all the sex she anticipated after he got his gift. She decided that she did want to try to do the masturbation film and requested that we go over the operating instructions for the remote camera, which we did.

The big day was two Saturdays before their anniversary, Tom was out of town fishing with some other friends and their kids were at his parents' house for the weekend. Lisa showed up at my place at 6:30 in the morning. She parked in the garage so that nobody would know she was here.

She had several suitcases with her and I carried them to the studio. Lisa marveled at how I had transformed the room for her shoot.

"So, how do we get started?" Lisa asked.

"I've never done one of these before." I said.

"You're the creative one, think of something." Lisa said.

"Well, this is a gift for Tom right, why don't you start with a message for him." I suggested.

"Good idea, that will start things off right." Lisa said.

I fired up my main camera and gave her a signal to start.

"Hi baby. I can't believe it's been ten years already can you? I love you so much that I just had to give you a super special anniversary present, I hope you like it." Lisa said.

She had come over in a sweat suit and she was still a little nervous about changing in front of me or in front of the camera so she went to change behind the screen I had set up. When she came back she was in the red dress that Tom really liked.

"Where's your regular camera? I thought you were gonna take pictures too." Lisa said.

"I'm gonna do screen captures from the film, that way we can pick the absolute best pictures and not just rely on me pressing a button." I said.

"Okay, how should I do this?" Lisa asked.

"Pose for him, show off for him. Talk to him. You said this is his favorite dress, but what is it that he likes about the dress?" I asked.

"He likes the way my ass looks in it and the way it shows off most of my cleavage." Lisa said.

"Good, go with that, like bend over and give him a look down at your cleavage as you talk about it to him and stick your ass out and wiggle it for him as you look over your shoulder and tell him all about how much you love it when he looks at your ass. Stuff like that." I said.

Lisa took her position and I turned the camera back on.

"Hey baby, look what I'm wearing. Your favorite dress, it's so tight, I just love the way it feels against my skin. I don't have anything on under it because the dress is so tight a bra or panties would show." Lisa said.

She moved the dress off one shoulder to show that there was no bra strap and turned away from the camera and lifted the back hem to reveal the bottom of her ass proving that she wasn't wearing any panties.

"Do you like seeing the bottom of my ass coming out of my dress? I know you love how the dress makes my ass look, I like the way it feels against my ass." Lisa said.

She pulled the dress down tight across her ass and I focused the camera on the smooth fabric stretched across her gorgeous behind. She massaged the cheeks of her ass through the dress while talking to Tom.

"Don't you wish it was your hands on my ass right now? I do, I just love the way your powerful hands feel all over my body, and when I wear this dress they always find their way to my ass and to my breasts. Speaking of which my nipples are getting hard just thinking about how you'd play with them. Can you see them?" Lisa asked.

She turned so that her chest was facing the camera and sexily brought her hands up and cupped her breasts then using her thumbs and index fingers she gave both of her nipples a little squeeze through the dress.

"Oh baby, can you see them? You always tell me how hot I look with my nipples poking out like this." Lisa said.

If Tom would be able to see them on the film or not I had no idea, but I could sure as hell see them and damn they looked hot.

"Look at all that cleavage. I know that you love the way this dress shows my breasts off. How far down can you see?" Lisa asked.

I zoomed in on her cleavage peering as far down her dress as possible. She posed for a little while longer in the red dress and then headed behind the screen to change. She proceeded to pose in a couple more dresses and some other outfits that Tom liked, then when she was in the last one she changed gears.

"This dress is nice, but knowing you you're picturing what I have on under it. Well why imagine it when you can see it for real?" Lisa asked.

She unzipped the dress and let it fall to her ankles. I almost dropped the camera as I saw what she was wearing. She was wearing a set of white lingerie that was lacy and semi sheer. I could clearly see her nipples through the bra, and I could tell that she was totally shaved from just a quick glimpse at the panties.

"Do you remember this baby? Can you believe that it still fits after ten years and three kids? That's right, it's the lingerie I wore to our wedding, and more importantly it's the lingerie I took off that night when you made me a woman. Did you know I still had this? I haven't worn it since that night, but I pulled it back out just for this special occasion baby." Lisa said.

She modeled eight other lingerie outfits getting more and more daring and sexy in her motions and her words to Tom, after awhile she got to the point where she wasn't gonna be wanting me around any more.

"Okay baby, you've seen my in my clothes, you've seen me in lingerie, but now it's time for the really big part of your gift." Lisa said.

I took that as my cue to turn on the remote camera, give her the controls and give her the key to the padlock that would be on the inside of the only door so she could be sure nobody would barge in on her. I went out to my office to begin editing together the footage from the total of seven cameras that had recorded her modeling. Of course most of the footage would come from the main camera that I was operating, but the six stationary cameras had recorded some good material as well and by splicing in some of the different angles the end result would look a lot more professional than it would if it was all shot from a single camera.

For close to three hours I worked. I began to wonder what was taking her so long. Eventually I decided to go and knock at the door to see if everything was all right, but as I walked down the hall to check on her the door opened and Lisa came out crying.

"What's the matter?" I asked.

"I can't do it." Lisa said.

"Oh, well, you said you've had problems doing it when he was watching, it's probably just nerves." I said.

"Oh no, that's not the part that I'm having trouble with, in fact that part turned out to be really easy." Lisa said.

"Then what can't you do?" I asked.

"I can't control the camera and keep myself aroused at the same time, I just can't do both at the same time." Lisa said.

"Oh, that's too bad. Are you sure that you aren't doing a good job? I mean maybe you were getting so into the other thing you were doing that you controlled the camera good without knowing it." I said.

"No, it's bad, I stopped and looked at the tape a couple of times, it's terrible. I want to do this for him so bad, but I can't do it alone so I'm gonna have to have someone running the camera." Lisa said.

"Do you maybe wanna call Julie or Heather or one of your other friends to run the camera for you?" I asked.

"No way, I don't want anybody else to know about this. You're gonna have to be the one to film it." Lisa says.

"Are you sure that you'll be able to do it with me in there?" I asked.

"As long as you don't talk to me or do anything to distract me I should be able to play with myself pretty convincingly, but I don't know if I'll be able to cum and I so wanted to cum for Tom." Lisa said.

"Well I've got a ski mask that would hide my face if that would help." I said.

"That would be a big help, who knows maybe I'll surprise myself and be able to cum, I really need too, I teased myself so much before but the camera was too much of a distraction for me to ever reach orgasm." Lisa said.

We went back into the studio and she locked the door. I put on the ski mask and reloaded my camera.

"Do you want the other camera's on for other angles? It would take just a few minutes to reload and reposition them." I said.

"Well if you're gonna be here filming it you might as well edit together this part too so what the hell." Lisa said.

I quickly repositioned the stationary cameras so that they would also be recording the action.

"Okay, I'm just about set up. Just so we don't surprise one another, how close is too close because this baby has a zoom lens but the closer you are when you zoom the more detail you can show. If you want me on the other side of the room I'll shoot it as best as I can, but Tom won't have a front row seat for the show you're tying to give him. To give him the front row seat I'd need to be at the edge of the bed at the farthest, but it's up to you." I said.

"Well, if you're gonna see me naked you might as well do it close up so that the footage you shoot will be better for Tom so you can be at the edge of the bed, but unless you really need to get a certain shot stay off of the bed itself. And remember no talking." Lisa said.

"I have that covered." I said and I put a piece of tape over my mouth.

Lisa laughed, which was good because she was really nervous.

"Are you ready to shoot this?" Lisa asked.

I gave her a thumbs up and started rolling.

"Hey baby, I tried for three hours to give you this without any help behind the camera, but I couldn't do it so I enlisted a silent discreet camera operator to help. I hope that I can do it this time." Lisa said.

With that she opened the robe she had on leaving her totally naked. I was glad that I'd taped my mouth shut or I know I would have had to say DAMN!

Lisa walked over to the bed and climbed into the middle. The bed was disheveled and there was an assortment of sex toys on one side and a bottle of lubricant on the other.

I stood at the end of the bed doing a full body shot as she positioned the pillows so she could lean on them and then she propped herself up on them, and spread her legs as she drew her knees up so her feet were close to her ass.

She took a bottle of lubricant and dripped a good amount just above her pussy. It ran down over and between the lips of her pussy and she took her other hand and massaged the lube into her pussy slipping her fingers in and out of her pussy.

She rubbed her clit with one hand while using the other to probe her pussy for a few minutes then she reached for the first of the toys. What she grabbed first was one of those little lipstick sized vibrators, which she immediately placed against her clit as she continued to explore her pussy with her fingers.

The buzzing sound of the vibrator was the only sound in the room. I had been told not to speak and she didn't seem to want to. From time to time Lisa would move the vibrator up and hold it against her nipples for a few seconds and then back to her clit. 

The second toy she picked up was one of those silver metal vibrators that looks like an oversized bullet. She turned it on and began teasing the outer lips of her pussy with it and plunging the metal cylinder into the depths of her pussy. She continued to use the small vibrator on her clit and nipples and for about ten minutes she buzzed away with the two vibrators.

Then she looked over to the assortment of toys and reached for a butt plug. She covered it thoroughly with lubricant then put her left leg behind her head to hold her ass in the air as she applied a liberal amount of lubricant to her asshole itself.

When her asshole was well oiled she rolled over onto her stomach and raised up onto her hands and knees. I was directly behind her as she did this so I got a great shot of her ass as she rose up.

Lisa then took the butt plug in her hand and reaching between her legs she pressed it against her asshole. It didn't look like she was going to be able to get it in for a few minutes, then using both hands she was able to force it in past the tight ring of her anus. When it was in she flipped the switch on the bottom and the buttplug began to vibrate.

Lisa then grabbed a thick black dildo and pressed it into her pussy. She began vigorously jamming the dildo into her pussy and moaning. The view from the back was great, but it didn't tell the whole story so I moved to the left side of the bed, the side that Lisa was facing.

I caught every last expression on her face as she filled herself repeatedly with the rubber dick. I found an angle that allowed me to shoot back between her legs and see the dildo going in.

I moved all around the bed shooting her from every angle for nearly twenty minutes before she changed positions. Lisa pulled the dildo from her pussy and rolled over onto her back again. She took the dildo and started licking it and taking it into her mouth. She picked up the silver vibrator and resumed probing her pussy with the buzzing cylinder as the butt plug continued to hum in her ass.

She sucked the rubber dick and probed her pussy with the dildo for almost half an hour and I could tell she was getting close so I zoomed in and documented every last spasm and every last drop of juice that squirted out of Lisa's quivering pussy.

I made sure to keep rolling in case she had any post orgasmic messages for Tom, but I needed to go jerk off in the worst way.

"There you go baby, I hope you enjoyed it, I know I did, and from the looks of things so did our friend the camera man. You can go jerk off now." Lisa said.

I almost threw the camera to the ground as I ran off to the bathroom. It didn't take very long; I pretty much opened my pants, grabbed some toilet paper, held it in front of my dick and barely touched my fingers to my cock and boom. My cock erupted spurting forth huge amounts of cum. The toilet paper I had grabbed wasn't enough so cum shot onto the floor.

When my dick was finally done shooting cum I zipped up my pants, cleaned up the floor, washed my hands, and headed back to the studio.

Lisa was cleaning up the bed, and she was still totally naked. When she saw me come in she smiled.

"Did you make it or did you ruin your pants?" Lisa asked.

"I made it, but it was a close call, that was the hottest thing I've ever seen." I said.

"That was the hottest thing I've ever done without my husband. I don't know if it was because I was doing it for Tom, or if it had something to do with all of the teasing I did earlier when I tried to run the camera, or maybe it was because you were watching, but whatever it was that did it, that was the hardest orgasm I've ever had without actually having sex with Tom." Lisa said.
