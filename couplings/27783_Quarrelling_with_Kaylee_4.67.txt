Author's Note: I realize this story may seem a bit long at first glance. Please note that is has been divided into several small, manageable chapters. Since I wrote it as all once piece, I wanted to submit it that way.

Synopsis: It's spring break and Kaylee, a freshman in college, doesn't have the means to go on an exciting vacation like her classmates. Desperate to get away from her dorm, she decides to make the short trip to visit her older sister for the holiday. Once there, she resolves to try and seduce her sister's boyfriend, who also lives there. He finds himself reluctantly attracted to Kaylee, and tries his hardest to resist her advances for the next week. The story takes place from his point of viewâ€¦
