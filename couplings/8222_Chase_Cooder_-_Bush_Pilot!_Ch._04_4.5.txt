 Welcome back to the exciting adventures of Chase Cooder - Bush Pilot! In this episode Chase and Box confront the killers, discover clues about nefarious deeds, and more! 

But before we depart I must tell you that this is a special submission. I'm sad to say one of the characters did not want to have sex; they told me it just wasn't right for them or the tale. However, dear readers, fear not! As you might imagine by the story category, I've arranged something special for you. That's right! At the end of the chapter is the deleted sex scene for your pleasure and amusement. 

Please read the chapter, then vote and comment, then return to the deleted scene if you wish. Ready? Climb aboard, buckle up and enjoy the ride!
