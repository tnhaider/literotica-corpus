 Tanya sighed as she flopped down into bed and pulled up the sheets, covering up a taut, sexy body sadly clad in an old t-shirt and a pairs of drab shorts. No use dressing up pretty tonight, she thought, looking at the empty space next to her on the bed. She had told herself she would enjoy the holidays this year despite being single, but now it was Christmas Eve and she just felt so...lonely.

True, she had spent a great day with her family, and several of her wonderful friends had practically begged her to spend the night so she wouldn't be alone. So it wasn't some kind of pathetic, depressing holiday. She just wished she had someone cuddle up with on the couch to watch some Christmas movies.

Well, maybe that's not ALL I wish for. There was a persistent little tingle between her thighs. Reflexively, she reached down and lightly rubbed herself. Though it was just a brief touch, her body reacted instantly. Her clit throbbed and both nipples stiffened against her t-shirt as Tanya moaned in frustration. No, better not start that! The Latin beauty grabbed her extra pillow and clutched it tightly to her body as she rolled onto her right side. I've been nice this year, why doesn't Santa bring me a nice, hard cock? She giggled at herself, and she was sure she was blushing. What's gotten into me, thinking stuff like this! Feeling a little embarrassed, Tanya drifted off to sleep, visions definitely dancing in her headâ€”but it wasn't sugarplums she was picturing!
