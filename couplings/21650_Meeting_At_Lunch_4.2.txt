'Excuse me, mam. Is this seat free?'

'Yes.'

'Do you mind if I join you?'

'I never say "no" to a gentleman.'

'You NEVER say "no"?'

'Well, very rarely.'

'Then, thank you.'

'You're welcome.'

'The bar normally this full?'

'Only when the Lions have a home game. That what brings you here?'

'No, I had business in town. . . Good day for a game though, warm without being stifling.'

'I suppose so. I hadn't noticed.'

'Do you come here often?'

'Please, spare me the tired old cliches.'

'All right then, what would you like me to say?'

'Something to please me.'

'You're very attractive.'

'That's better.'

'I like your hair. I'm the one man who doesn't prefer blondes.'

'Anything else?'

'Your lips are just ripe for kissing.'

'We'll have to see about that.'

'I wonder what they taste of.'

'Play your cards right and maybe you'll find out.'

'You fill that blouse most attractively.'

'Oh, you flatterer. Go on.'

'I can't see much else while you're sitting down.'

'There, how's that?'

'What gorgeous long legs.'

'And?'

'Do they go all the way up?'

'That's for you to find out.'

'Oh, happy the man you part them for.'

'I always do my best to please.'

'You're altogether delightful, dazzling and desirable.'

'So you want me?'

'I cannot deny it. This bulge says it all.'

'Looks serious. A case for emergency treatment?'

'It's becoming that way.'

'Right then, pay the bill. Let's go.'

'Your place or mine?'

'Neither, I'm a child of nature and you said it was warm.'

'If you say so. My wheels are over there.'

'Right. To the woods. To the woods. Take me to the woods.'
