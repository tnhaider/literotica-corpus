 'Unbelievable!' Dutch told himself, recalling that memorable night. "Just fucking unbelievable," this he said aloud. 

Of course the four had never gotten together again. Marty had been killed in a mugging two days before Alice and Robert returned from their honeymoon. They were all stunned by it and it was quite a while before Dutch had joined Robert and Alice for some fairly decent threesomes, But after getting together several times, some of the luster had been lost, something new was needed.

The bartender approached Dutch who indicated that he wanted another scotch. And as the bartender filled his glass, Dutch's thoughts turned to Rosa and his brow furrowed.

'I should call her. She'll think all I wanted was a one night stand.' He told himself.

He was quiet for a time, not thinking about anything, absentmindedly sipping his drink. Then he found himself thinking about her again. He realized he missed her and wanted to be with her again.

'I better call," he thought, reliving her very uninhibited appetite. He slid off the barstool and headed for the phone, pausing to adjust himself, for he was now sporting an erection.

It took him several minutes to locate her number. He had to empty his wallet of all its contents and sift through tem before finding the tiny scrap of paper with her name and number on it.

She answered on the first ring. Five minutes later he delivered a solid kick to the door of his Volvo that produced what Dutch considered a handsome dent. Then he slipped behind the wheel and drove to Rosa's place.
