 0: The Fool

Genesis LeClair had a throbbing headache and her mouth felt like it was stuffed with cotton. A hangover. The pillow was so soft, if she could just go back to sleep, the pain was sure to go away eventually. She refused to concede to this reality. She wouldn't open her eyes. Beside her, someone groaned and turned over. 

Alex. 

Her eyes popped open of their own accord and she saw blue plaid sheets that were certainly not her own. She found that she was also very naked. 

Shit. 

Regardless of her headache and Alex's slumber, she leaped out of the bed. Alex slept on, ignorant to her distress. Her head pounded in response to the sudden movement. Water. Water would help. She started toward the bathroom. It didn't help that the layout of the house was still unfamiliar to her; she had moved in only the day before.
