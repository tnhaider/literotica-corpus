The day my divorce was final, my long-time friend and hairdresser, Stacy, and I decided to celebrate. Stacy had been through it all with me, from the planning of my wedding, through two years or so of wedded bliss, the loss of a job, the birth of my child, the slow death of my marriage during the six years that followed, and finally, the divorce. I only saw her every six weeks for my appointments, and it always amazed me how we could continue right where we left off with our friendship. We hadn't met until I was around thirty-five, but I felt like I'd known her all my life and could tell her anything.

I had an appointment the week before the big day. Upon hearing the news, Stacy exclaimed, "Girl, we should go out that night!"

As luck would have it, it was a Friday. My daughter would be spending the weekend with her grandparents, and I was free as a bird. Me. Free. I agreed that a celebration was definitely in order. 

After some discussion, we settled on the Cleveland Flats as our destination. I hadn't been to the Flats, the Cleveland warehouse district and a Mecca of bars and restaurants, since my college days nearly 20 years before. With some trepidation I said, "We need to find a place that has an older crowd though, okay?"

"Oh my God. Stop it," muttered Stacy. "You know guys love older women. Besides, I'm going to do your hair and makeup. You'll look hot." 

I love this woman. She makes me look good and feel good. As I was leaving, we hugged, and I thanked her and asked, "We're going for sure, right?"

"Fuck, yeah! And I'm driving," she replied. "Shit. Too bad we couldn't get a limo."

I thought about this for a moment. "Well, it's not a bachelorette party or anything." 

Stacy thought about it too and giggled, "It is. You're becoming a bachelorette again."
