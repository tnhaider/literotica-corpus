 Me and my partner found these last year while searching a missing person's apartment for clues. Who knows what happened to the guy. All I know is this was the best lead we had and the NYPD sure as hell ain't flying up to the North Pole to investigate. Long story short: I made me some copies before turning them over to evidence. Believe what you will. But these have stirred up my Christmas "feeling" ever since. - Cheers!
