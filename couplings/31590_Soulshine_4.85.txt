 There is a difference between having sex and making love. I would have been unconvinced of that, through any explanation or demonstration, no more than a few years ago. And not that there is anything wrong with having sex - I enjoy sex as often as I can, but making love is different. Making love is two souls touching, intertwined and wanting, until the wanting is so intense that the souls, even if for just moments, become one.

Rachel is a great example of a soul that, once touched, is now part of me. I carry a piece of her with me wherever I go. In the supermarket I sometimes wonder if she's shopping for potatoes; at the racetrack I ponder how many times her sweet clitoris ever bumped a saddle horn; whenever I see a couple, happy and glowing, I think about her and I hope that she is happy. And so on.

Wherever you are, Rachel, I hope that you are happy. I hope you have a man that manages to touch your soul once in a while. I hope you have a man that massages your soul whenever you need it.

I want that for you more than I want anything.
