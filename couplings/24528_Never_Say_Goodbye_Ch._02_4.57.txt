 Here is my second chapter of Aiden's and Jakobi's story. Thanks for all the wonderful comments I got on the first chapter! Hopefully you enjoy this one, as it focuses on Jakobi and Aiden's sexual tension and relationship returning to what it once was. Thanks.

Jakobi was a mess as he sprinted to the locker room, ignoring the screams of his coach in the distance. That was behind him. All he could think about was that girl in the tight blue dress waiting for him.

He reached the locker room, heading in and sliding off his uniform, still clean from not having played. His head was muddled with thoughts of Aiden, and how breathtaking she was. If she was still the quick-witted, sharped-tongued, smart ass that had driven him crazy in the best of ways freshman year, she was the whole package. His thoughts drifted to how close they'd been back then, how often he went to her when he could go to no one else. How would of guessed a few years later he would be fighting back lustful thoughts in a locker room with her waiting outside?

He forced himself to focus on changing into a black short sleeved shirt and long tan shorts. He was tying his sneakers when he heard her soft voice calling him outside. "Jakobi... you coming?"

Maybe a bit later. Maybe on your face. JAKOBI STOP IT. He scolded himself as he finished tying his shoe laces. Who's to say she wants any part of you anyway? He shoved all this things in his shoulder bag and jogged out of the locker room, leaving all his thoughts behind.

She was sitting on the steps outside the gym, humming to herself as she waited. Jakobi stopped for a minute, to stare at the way her dress hugged the subtle curve of her hips. It was a delicious sight. Everything about his old friend oozed catlike sexuality. Again, he had to shake the thoughts of her body wrapped around him from his head. Calm the fuck down, Jakob.

"Hey stranger." He said, offering his hand to help her up. She eyed it before accepting and letting him pull her to her feet. "Hey there." She said softly. She brushed the dirt from her jacket and stared at him. God, it had been a long time. Before he could say anything more, she stood on her tiptoes to put her arms around his neck and hug him tightly. He dropped his bag to hug her back. "I've missed you soo much Jakobi." She murmured, kissing his cheek lightly as she pulled away. He grinned, nodding. "We have a lot to catch up on, Connors," he said quietly. "Lets walk and talk."
