 ***** 1 *****

Being young and constantly broke happens to a lot of people, and I was no exception. One thing this leads to is needing to have roommates in order to afford rent on an apartment. One of my first apartments was shared with two guys I worked with. Not too long after we moved in, both of them had their girlfriends move in with us. I couldn't get a girlfriend to save my life -- sometimes being introverted can be a curse. Since I was single, we were now sharing the rent five ways -- now we could actually spend money on food other than Top Ramen.

I got along with all of them OK, but I always seemed to catch Mary stealing a look at me. Her boyfriend (Luke) was a lightweight and had a problem with passing out early after having a few beers. He could be anywhere -- the floor, the couch, and sometimes even making it to bed. Drinking either beer or coffee, I was always up late, so she and I would spend a lot of time just hanging out and chatting.

The other roommate and his girl were still fairly newly attached, so they rarely left their room. They were always the last ones up in the morning and the first ones to leave for the night. It didn't take a rocket scientist to know what they were up to all the time. They were quite bashful about showing any PDA except for holding hands and quick kisses.

Mary and Luke also stayed fairly busy in the bedroom, but he wouldn't usually last too long, and once he finished he was passed out for the night. I know this because I may have possibly watched a time or two. They were not at all shy about getting frisky, she liked to flaunt what she had.

Luke and Mary's bedroom was actually supposed to be an office, and it had a set of bi-fold doors, and they didn't always close properly, especially when Mary would made sure of it. I know that because our eyes met at least once as she was closing the doors. I saw her make a point of stopping the doors before they met, followed by a wink as she turned around. It helped that she liked to leave the lights on during sex. At least she did on the times the door didn't close all the way.

But I'm getting ahead of myself. Mary was about 10 years older than the rest of us, and I think she just wanted Luke for a boy toy, just to play with for a while. A few weeks after she moved in, and we had been quickly becoming friends, I noticed a change in her. I noticed that she did not seem to be 'into' him when he wasn't around.

The first time anything "happened" it was late on a Friday night. The three of us were watching TV, Luke and Mary were lying on the floor watching and I was on the couch to the side of them. They had been making out a little bit and not surprisingly, after about a half hour Luke fell asleep. I had worked up a thirst at work and was making good progress on a 12-pack of beer. They had a few drinks each, and once Mary saw him passed out she make a rude comment or three. She really was upset, but at least it was something we both got a (quiet) laugh out of.

Frustrated, she got up to get another drink. Out of the corner of my eye I saw her stop on the way back in, staring at me. I looked over and she continued back into the room, a silly grin on her face. She lay back down by Luke, but couldn't seem to get comfortable. Finally she asked me if she could have a pillow from the couch. 

I went to toss it to her, but she held up a hand. "No, you will spill my drink! Bring it here please?"

Acting put-upon, I got up and slowly walked it over to her. Her hand covered mine just for a moment as she looked into my eyes. She blushed a bit, took it from me and mumbled something that sounded like "Thanks hon."

I was a bit confused at this but thought the wine was getting to her. Once she finally got settled, Luke rolled over, putting an arm across her, his hand pushing up one breast. The look on her face said she didn't like that. It was still fairly warm and muggy out, and she made a face and said "Ugh. Too warm."

She gently moved his arm out of the way, and I could tell then she wasn't wearing a bra. His hand had rubbed a nipple the right way and made it stand up at attention. She scooted a foot or so closer to me, and I just stared. As a single guy not too successful in the women department, I had problems not looking at women's bodies. So I stared. Quite openly too. My eyes were glued to her pointed nipple, and her boobs softly bouncing as she moved.

Naturally I got caught staring. She looked down to see what had captured my interest. She looked back at me and cocked her head. "You shouldn't be staring like that. You know I'm taken."

But her body language didn't agree with her mouth. She just bounced a little more trying to get comfortable on the pillow. Maybe it was my imagination, but I think the other nipple started growing a bit too. I turned back to face the TV show, but I didn't watch. My mind was jumbled. What was happening here? Was she really getting turned on by me watching her boobs?

A minute later she started fanning the bottom of her shirt up and down a little. "Ahh, this is nice. Cool air feels good."

She left her shirt halfway up her torso, stopping at about the bottom of her ribs. Of course, I couldn't help but start staring again. Of course, she also caught me staring again. Feeling weird about it, I turned back to the TV. I still had issues watching, still fighting the thought that she was flirting with me.

A while later, I was finally able to distract myself with the TV show. The action movie was showing a love scene, and I saw something different out of the corner of my eye. Not turning my head I looked back at Mary, and saw she was staring intently at the show, rubbing her boobs. My eyes about popped out of my head seeing this, and that her shirt had ridden up further, now just barely covering the bottom of her breasts.

Trying to be discreet about staring was hopeless, I was now flat-out staring at her, eyes glued to her. Not until she stopped moving her hands did I break my stare. She was watching me stare. We locked eyes, and she just smiled. She pulled up one side of her shirt, fully exposing one breast.

"Close your mouth, silly! So do you like what you see?" she asked.

Whispering back, I said "Hell ya I'm liking this! But what the hell are you doing? Luke is sleeping right next to you!"

She glanced over at him. Looking back, she said "He is so out of it right now, he wouldn't move if I kicked him. So are you going to do anything about what you are seeing?"

I couldn't believe my eyes or ears. My mind was a jumble of question, a new one being asked before the previous thought finished: "This couldn't really be happening, could it?" "My roommate's girlfriend is really coming on to me?" "The one chance I get to play with this girl, and the 'guy code' is blocking me?"

Finally spitting out words instead of everything being said silently inside my head, I replied with "I'm sorry, but I can't do that Mary. Luke is my buddy! We would both regret this in the morning."

Putting her lower lip out faking a pout, she replied "Well fine then. So does this mean you aren't going to look anymore either?"

I didn't know what I was doing, but before I realized it, I went from lying down on the couch to starting to stand up. "Um, um, I need another beer."

Walking into the kitchen got me a minute to buy some time. I couldn't believe what was happening. This could not continue. This was not right. Turning to the fridge to get a fresh bottle, I noticed a bulge in my jeans. I suppressed a laugh as I realized that without knowing it I had walked past Mary like this, telling her exactly how much I had enjoyed her show.

Coming back to the couch, I could see that Mary's shirt was back down over her boobs, just her belly exposed. As I drew up even with her, she leaned her head back on the pillow and stared at me, then reached out to grab my leg. 

"Come down here for a sec, I need to tell you something" she whispered.

I really don't know why, but I sat down by her. She leaned up on one elbow and waggled her finger, telling me to come closer. I lay down next to her, up on my elbow, just like her. We were only about a foot away, and we leaned in towards each other.

Looking at me intently, she whispered "You need to touch me, just once. I'm gonna burst if you don't. Just once. No one will ever know, really."

She was begging me now! I felt her take my beer from my hand, then she grabbed my wrist. In one motion, she lay back on the pillow, pulled up her shirt showing me one boob, and put my hand on it. 

I was in shock. Maybe I should have expected it, but my brain was really buzzing with all these changes tonight.

I looked down, saw my hand on her breast, and her hand moving mine around. Her eyes were closed, biting her lower lip, and breathing deeply. She arched her back, pushing herself into my hand even more. 

She let go of my hand, but I didn't move it away. I couldn't! I thought I may as well, I'm here already and enjoying it. I tweaked her nipple and she shuddered. Leaning down, I brought my mouth to her and slowly sucked her nipple into my mouth, teasing it with my tongue. I nibbled just a bit, just a tiny bit of teeth.

Her whole body was writhing, her face had turned bright red. Suddenly, she pushed me away. Looking over quickly, I stared at Luke -- but no, he was still out cold. Mary was trying to control her breathing.

"Holy Shit.... You were not supposed to do that, I wasn't ready for you to do that. You have to stop right now -- or you won't be able to stop me from fucking your brains out right now."

She took my hand and yanked it down to the waistband of her shorts. She shoved my hand down her pants, under her panties, making me feel the heat from her pussy. Her pussy was soaking wet and hot as hell. Not thinking or realizing what I was doing before I did it, I just went with what felt good, and that was to slide two fingers up inside of her.

Hooking my fingers back to the front, I found her G spot, making every movement of mine send a shiver of pleasure up and down her body. No longer holding on to me, she put one hand in her mouth, biting down to keep from screaming. I pushed her shirt back up, giving me a nice view of both boobs. I just took a pinch of her nipple, moving it around. 

Stopping suddenly again, she grabbed my arms and took my hands off of her. "Stop it, stop it, stop it. We can't. Oh damn, we have to stop. We just can't.... no....."

She got up and quickly went to the bathroom. Confused and feeling guilty, I lay back down on the couch, staring at the TV but seeing nothing that was on. About 5 minutes later Mary came back out looking flushed and tried to scowl at me, but just ended up smiling. 

"You are bad, mister. Just bad. It sure took you long enough though."

She knelt down by Luke and shook him halfway awake, and took him to bed. A minute later she came back out wearing just a night shirt, turning off the bedroom light and closing the door. I wasn't sure what to expect when she walked over to me. She stopped a few feet from the couch and I sat up. She just stood there for a minute, then shook her head.

"Don't even think about it, buddy. I don't know why I'm thinking what I am, but it's all bad. We can't. But thank you for what you did earlier, that was intense."

She took a step towards me, leaned forward, and kissed me hard, forcing her tongue inside my mouth. Stepping back, she caught her breath, and turned to leave. She stopped to pick up the pillow, bending at the waist, just far enough down for her shirt to ride up, showing me her pussy. She stayed there for about 5 seconds. I know she knew exactly what she was doing.

Grabbing the pillow, she stood up and ended the show. She turned and gave me a quick smile and tossed the pillow at my head.

My mind was still reeling from what happened, so I knew I would have some issues getting to sleep nicely. Into the shower I went, replaying the past 10 minutes in my mind, but I was so turned on that my cock was hard before I turned the water on. Only two minutes later, I exploded, my energy running down the drain.

As I lay in bed, replayed the night in my head non-stop. After about an hour, I skipped over the sexy parts this time, but looking for other clues. Was she just messing with me? Or using me? Was I slated to make up for what Luke couldn't provide her with? Would I let myself do it? Could I ignore my friendship with Luke and allow myself to do stuff with his woman?

She was good looking, but that wasn't all. The fact that a woman wanted ME, of all people, she wanted ME! And she started it! That was almost enough right there to break down any barriers. Maybe...

***** 2 *****

The next morning, we did our best to pretend that nothing had happened the night before. I stole glances at her when I thought no one would notice. And I did catch her checking me out on a couple of occasions. Luckily she didn't seem upset at all, and that was a huge relief. Unfortunately I didn't get a chance to talk to her about what had happened the night before, so I wasn't totally sure how she was dealing with everything. 

Luke and Mary were going out that evening, so they went to take a shower before getting dressed up. Mary came out of the bathroom in a robe, needing to get something from their room. She did this often, so no one thought anything of it. From my spot on the chair, I had a straight line of sight into their bedroom, right into the closet. Naturally, that's right where she headed.

Turning around, she checked the view, and saw that only I could see her. The other two roommates were cuddling on the couch, oblivious to both of us. As I looked back, she untied her robe, letting it fall off her shoulders onto her arms. She just stood there, completely exposed, showing herself to me.

She put her robe back in place, got the handful of clothes she came in for, and headed back into the bathroom, not looking at anyone, acting as if nothing had happened. Well, my cock thought something had, that's for sure. I could barely cover the tent that had popped up in my jeans.

They were ready to head out, and the other roommates had gone away again, so I figured that I would just sit and watch TV all night. I got a wink from Mary as they walked out the door. About five minutes later, I heard their car pull up, and Mary came bouncing back in.

"Whoops, I seemed to have forgotten something" she said sarcastically as she went into the room.

She got something and put it into her purse. She walked back out and stood by me. She took my hand from the arm of the couch and held it for a minute.

She asked "So, do you like what I'm wearing?" 

"Damn right I do. I don't know if I have ever seen you in a skirt before. It wears you nicely."

"Well, I haven't worn one in a long time. Hey, you should feel my nylons." she said as she moved my hand to the inside of her thigh.

I moved my hand around saying it felt nice, but it wasn't enough. She pushed forward, and grabbed my arm. She moved my hand higher.

"So how high do my nylons go?"

My heart started pounding furiously, I couldn't believe this was happening! Our roommates were only in the other room, and her boyfriend, my buddy, was just in the car outside the door. And here I was with my hand up her skirt!

Apparently my morals went on vacation or something. Without a pause, my hand slid higher, gliding along her smooth thigh. I felt the top of her nylons -- connected to a garter belt! I kept going, and my hand stopped then it ran out of leg to feel, and just felt smooth skin. She also had no underwear on. Now instead of just having my hand up her skirt, now I was playing with her bare pussy. She was already soaking wet!

I moved my finger around her pussy lips, stroking gently, occasionally stopping to rub her clit. She started moving her hips, and she let out a soft moan. This time I stopped her, reluctantly pulling my hand away from her.

"Baby, you have got to go before Luke comes in. We can't be found like this" I whispered to her.

She backed away, just staring at me, a smile playing at the corners of her mouth.

As she got to the door I called softly to her. "Hey Mary, hell ya I like your outfit. Don't have too much fun tonight."

Her hand on the doorknob, she smiled and said "Of course we will have some fun, but we will see about later tonight!"

Now I was really curious, was she talking about while they were out or after they got back? Not just that, but who exactly is going to be involved?

About 3AM they came back, trying to be quiet but failing miserably. They went right into their room, but a minute later Luke came back out. He looked at me and rolled his eyes. "Damn she is forgetful tonight. I have to get something of hers from the car, be back in a sec."

He left their bedroom door open, and I saw Mary standing there by the closet. She saw me staring, but made no move to close the door. I knew it would not be long before Luke came back, and she must have thought the same thing. She quickly took all of her clothes off, but not so fast that she couldn't be a bit of a tease about it.

Totally naked, she just turned around a few times, letting me get a good view of what was going on. Grabbing the first things she could reach, she put on a pair of his workout clothes. A big t-shirt and a pair of loose gym shorts. Nothing else. She walked towards me, but stopped short. She put her finger up to her lips to say 'shush' and smiled as she finally closed the door.

Just then I heard Luke turning the door handle and quickly put my face back into the magazine I was reading (errr, hiding the tent in my jeans). He made a beeline from the door to his room, quickly mumbling "G'night man!" on his way by. 

Their light went off and the stereo went on, and I was glad that the music would cover their noises. Then the light went back on, and out she came. After a quick bathroom trip, she went back into the room. 

Stopping in the doorway, she said "I just forgot to go to the bathroom. Good night."

She closed the door, but didn't latch it. I swear that she left it like that on purpose since I caught her wink before she turned away.

Over the music, I could hear them tear into each other. Quiet exclamations and moans were coming through the door. Figuring that they would not get off the bed while making that kind of noise, I got up and crept to the door. I wanted to see why she seemed to want me to watch.

I looked through the middle gap in the bi-fold door and could get a decent view of what was going on. I couldn't help but think that the placement was intentional. He was laying on his back, sideways on the bed, with his head towards the door (and me). She was sideways to him (and me). Her left hand on the bed between his legs, her right hand reaching around to her side, going around her hip, playing with her pussy.

Her head was bouncing up and down on his cock, and she was taking the whole thing into her mouth every time she went down. Her boobs were swaying nicely as she worked on swallowing his cock. She put her head down, taking him all the way inside of her mouth, and just stayed there forever. Coming up quickly, she could start breathing again, panting after not being able to breathe around his cock lodged in her throat.

She looked him (or was it me?) and mouthed "Fuck me with your tongue!"

She spun her hips around, putting one knee on either side of his head, wagging her tail at him (and me). She smacked her ass, and put it down on his face, grinding her pussy on his mouth. His hands grabbed her hips, holding her tight against his face. I could see that her head was still bobbing, and I could only imagine seeing her mouth wrapped around his cock.

Feeling like a dirty old pervert for watching, I told myself to get to bed. Practically ripping myself away from my hidden vantage point, I turned off the lights and headed to my bedroom. I changed and got ready for bed, but laying down I just could not get to sleep. I couldn't take it anymore and got up to go watch again.
