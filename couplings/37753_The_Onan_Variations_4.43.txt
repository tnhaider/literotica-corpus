 Editor's Note:

My late Uncle, a prolific writer of short erotica, observed two principles. The first was to have several stories, or fragments of stories, in preparation at any one time - this he considered avoided writer's block, since if he felt temporarily unable to continue one story then he could switch to another. The second was to follow the premise that every good story has a beginning, a middle, and an end.

Following his demise the enclosed story fragments were found on his computer filed under the headings of 'Offering ', 'Preparing' and 'Taking' - which precisely match the need for a beginning, middle and end. Unfortunately there is no indication of which variation connects with which. 

In each fragment the action is very conventional and has just two characters. The first, Mea [or 'Male Erotic Arouser'], is a nubile young female just blossoming into maximum fertility. The second is you, the reader [and you know what you are - pun intended]. 

I recommend a set of dice - roll them, read the corresponding 'Offer' fragment. Repeat for 'Prepare' and 'Take', thus you have 6x6x6 or 216 different stories for the price of one. Enjoy.
