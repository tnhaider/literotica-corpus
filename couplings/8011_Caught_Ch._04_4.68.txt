On the one hand Brian felt a secret glee that he uncovered Evelyn as his mystery lover. On the other hand he felt guilty for not telling her as soon as he found out.

All along he suspected that the late night phone calls he received were from her. It couldn't have been a coincidence when he saw the woman wearing the same turquoise, yellow and green floral print mini-skirt he had seen Evelyn wear to work several times. She could have chosen any article of clothing to wear when she texted her semi-nude selfies to him.

He wondered then as he did now whether she was dropping hints along the way so he would discover her secret. He didn't know her well enough to determine that. He always thought she was very smart; she was after all an accountant. You can't be a stupid accountant! But then again, he knew several people who were very smart book-wise, but not so smart in life.

When he returned to work Monday he met Evelyn in the office kitchen. She was wearing a cream colored mini-skirt and dark blue blouse. He recognized it as the same outfit his mystery woman wore for one of her selfies. 

He bit his lip as he took in her form and said, "Good morning! How was your weekend?"

She turned toward him showing a frown which quickly turned into a weak smile.

"Good morning," she said quietly.

Brian ignored the cool greeting and went to the sink to wash his hands. He figured she would return to her normal friendly self in her own time. He didn't push her.

She turned to the refrigerator and placed her box lunch inside.

She watched him out of the corner of her eye and tried to think. She knew she would feel awkward upon seeing him and now she felt it. Ever since her self-revelation when his image popped into her head while masturbating she was feeling a little sad. She loved her husband madly but she now came to the conclusion that sex with her husband was no longer the thrill she once thought.

Brian left the kitchen and she sighed heavily. After washing her own hands she went to her desk. Her ruminations on her husband and her marriage continued as she got to work.

Late that afternoon she received an email from Brian.

-The latest chapter. Tell me what you think.

[Open Doc]

Yvette led her husband into the dimly lit office in the factory. When she opened the door, she grinned slyly at him and slipped through the door.

"What are we doing here?" her husband said irritably. "Why did you insist on bringing me here?"

"Come inside and I'll show you," she said from the darkness.

He stepped through the door and squinted at the dimness. He reached for the light switch and gasped softly when Yvette slapped his hand down.

"We don't need lights," she whispered softly as she wrapped her short curvy body around his. She put her thigh high up on his and pulled him firmly against her. One of her hands pulled against the small of his back. The other snaked into his hair and pulled him to her. She placed her lips against his in a passionate kiss.

He gasped again at her assault and then inhaled sharply when he discovered she was naked. 

When she walked through the door she had been wearing a long flowing dress that fell from her shoulders all the way to her ankles. It had long sleeves even though it was a summer dress meant for steamy July evenings.

"How did you get naked so fast?" he asked as she probed his lips with her tongue.

"I didn't wear underwear today," she said with a groan as she ground her pubis against his thigh.

"What?" he said sharply and then gasped as she slipped her hand into his slacks.

In no time he felt his pants fall to his ankles and she was on her knees in front of him. His cock, only now beginning to harden, slipped past her lips and he sighed as she sucked him.

"This woman is not my wife!" he thought to himself as he felt her mouth and tongue stimulating him. "My wife would never do these things! No underwear at work? Naked trysts in a deserted back office?"

Even as this passed through his mind he felt himself becoming immensely excited. The way she was devouring his erection reminded him of his mistress Anne.

Anne was a girl from his workplace who was trying to get ahead. She was very attractive; about 28 years old with blonde hair that she usually wore flowing over her shoulders and a cheerleader's body that she kept in shape.

She decided one day that she wanted to get a raise. She walked into his office and fell to her knees in from of his chair without saying a word. He leaned back and let her suck him into ecstasy and then gave her a raise. 

Since then, everything she wanted to accomplish, he had made happen for her; provided she did something new and wonderful for him. Her last exploit was to act as caddy for him and his three buddies on the golf course. She had done the entire eighteen holes naked. After the last ball was sunk, she gave him a memorable blowjob in the back seat of the golf cart while his golfing friends watched.

When they wanted their turns she coolly told them that they couldn't advance her career so, no blowjobs for them.

He was brought out of his reverie when Yvette sucked him all the way into her mouth while worming a finger into his rectum. When she twisted her finger and tickled his prostate he blasted a load of cum into her mouth with a groan.

As she took it all in his knees buckled and he stumbled back against a desk that he did not know was behind him.

She didn't give him time to recover. She pushed him to settle on the edge of the desk and straddled him with her legs wrapped around his back. She stroked him insistently and rubbed his cockhead against her soaking wet labia. Much to his surprise he grew hard again and then he was inside her.

She gasped and panted as she rode him. With an athleticism that he didn't know she had, she molded her body to his as she writhed against him. He leaned partially back and simply closed his eyes as he surrendered to her completely.

Before too long her gasps became grunts and she was slamming herself against him for all she was worth. She put her hands on his head and gripped his hair. He felt excruciating pain but her vagina was milking his cock, squeezing and rippling along the shaft using her internal muscles.

When she climaxed against him, her hands still gripping his hair and her hips undulating against his, he grunted and shot his semen inside her.

For a moment neither of them moved nor spoke. There was only the sound of their ragged breathing as they came down from their highs.

"My God Yvette!" he gasped, "where did you learn to do those things?"

"Wouldn't you like to know?" she said demurely.

She climbed down from his lap and pulled her dress over her head in one fluid motion. When it fell into place she smiled impishly.

"I want to know!" he whispered. 

She grinned at him and kissed him hard. When she pulled back she pinched his cheek gently.

"No you don't," she said. "Just like I don't want to know what you and that lovely assistant of yours have been up to."

He sputtered and worked his mouth trying to speak but she pressed a finger to his lips and hushed him.

"Get dressed Darling," she said coyly. "Maybe tonight I'll show you some of the other things I've learned."

His mouth hung open in shock but he pulled his slacks up and followed her out the door. She escorted him to the front of the building and said goodbye.

She walked languidly back to the deserted office and poked her head inside.

"Did you see everything?" she asked into the dimness.

"Yes I did!" Stuart said from the chair in the back corner. 

With the lights off, no one would notice him there if he didn't move.

"Did you enjoy it?" she said as she stepped fully into the room.

"Oh yes!" he replied.

She saw he had his cock in his hand and a big grin on his face.

"I think," she said with a tilt of her head to one side, "you're going to have to take care of that yourself this time."

She turned and left the room giving Stuart no time at all to say anything.

[Close Doc]

************************************************************

By the time Evelyn closed the document her eyes were wide and blazing. Up til now, she had been reading about Yvette's exploits with the single thought that her actions were that of a wanton woman cheating on an unsuspecting husband. While she admired her for her boldness and assertiveness, she felt a kind of pity for the husband who never appeared in the story. Now all that had changed.

With the brief back-story of his jaunts outside their marriage, she felt a sudden kinship with Yvette.

She was not entirely certain that her husband was cheating on her, but she wasn't entirely certain that he was not. His long drawn out days at the golf club on weekends and some late nights away from home with weak explanations to account for them had her suspecting that something might be happening. She was never sure and so had put them out of her mind unless and until some sort of proof offered itself.

With a sudden realization, she knew what had drawn her to read these stories about Yvette. In a way that she did not even understand before reading this chapter, she saw herself in Yvette's shoes.

She stood up from her desk abruptly and walked quickly to the deserted back office in the factory. When she entered the gloomy interior she looked around thoughtfully. 

She pulled her phone from her pocket and dialed Brian's number.

"Hello," he said. There was a lot of noise in the background. She guessed it was the sounds of the factory.

"Hi," she said breathlessly, "come see me in that back office! The one you always write about."

She hung up before he had a chance to say anything.

She stood in one corner of the room and leaned back against one of the desks. When he entered he walked in without turning on the lights. She was glad of that.

"What's up?" he asked curiously.

She stared at him with wide eyes not really sure how to begin.

"Evelyn?" he said. "Are you okay?"

She bit her lip and tried to bring herself to talk.

He remained just inside the doorway, another thing she was grateful for. She wasn't sure what she would do if he approached her.

She cast her eye around the room and began.

"This is the place isn't it," she said evenly, surprising herself with her calmness.

"What place?" he said with a crease of his brow.

"This is the back office you're always writing about," she said sternly.

"Yes," he replied.

"Do you imagine yourself in here with me?" she challenged.

He bit his lip and took a breath to speak.

"Never mind," she said quickly, raising her hand up to stop him. "I know you do."

He frowned and decided to just let her speak.

She looked around the room one more time and nodded almost imperceptibly.

"I can see the attraction," she said. "It's private and the dim light makes it look more romantic. I assume that door behind you locks?"

He nodded as she continued to take in her surroundings.

"It's a little cold," she said. "I can't see anyone taking their clothes off in here. It would be freezing!"

She chuckled a little and then gave him a soft smile.

"So," she went on, "this is where all those steamy passages take place? Including today's instalment?"

He nodded again and her smile waned a bit.

"Why did you write about Yvette with her husband this time?" she asked.

Brian paused a moment, mostly waiting to see if she were going to stop him from talking again.

"I wanted to write about something a little different," he said. "She's been fooling around with Stuart so much I realized there was only one direction to go if I kept that up."

"Why only one direction," she asked.

"The only logical end to the story," he said, "was for her to leave her husband for him. That would essentially be the end of it. I didn't want to end it just yet."

She studied him for a moment trying to work out what she wanted to say.

"Why not," she asked, "because I like reading it?"

"Yes," he said without elaborating.

She folded her arms across her chest when she sensed her nipples hardening. She looked down at the floor and then back at him. She realized in that moment that she desperately wanted him to come to her; to take her in his arms and kiss her with every ounce of his being.

She knew if he stepped toward her, even a half step, she would throw herself against him. She knew she would let him take her right here and now. She swallowed a little bit and took a deep breath.

When she looked at him again she realized he had no idea what was running through her mind. 

"Would he do it?" she asked herself. "Would he take her and kiss her in here? Would he raise her up on the desk and lift her skirt the way he wrote about? Would he penetrate her in the heat of passion as she cried out in ecstasy?"

She decided that he would if she gave him permission. She looked down again and struggled to regain her self-control.

"I liked the story today," she said. "It went in a different direction, but I like surprises."

He smiled and leaned against the desk at his side. When he did, she secretly wished he would lean against the desk she stood at. She wanted him to so she could lean her head against his chest, lay down her defenses and melt against him. She sighed again and struggled to put those thoughts out of her mind.

Without even being aware of it, she found herself leaning against the side of the same desk as he. She brushed against him as they both stood with their arms folded across their chests. She felt a tingle at the contact and she was sure he would see the goose pimples traveling up and down her arms.

On a whim she turned toward him and kissed him softly on the cheek. She paused with her face only inches from his and looked into his eyes. He simply stared back and, for the first time, she could not read the look on his face.

"Would you like me to kiss you properly?" he asked her gently, still not moving at all.

She nodded but looked down as she said, "Yes, but I don't think I can let that happen."

He nodded and allowed her to move away from him at her own pace.

"Do you think I should try the same thing with my husband?" she asked him, blushing deeply as she said it.

"What do you mean?" he asked.

"Maybe I should take him somewhere like Yvette did," she said with a mischievous grin, "Take him somewhere and give him a, um, wonderful time!"

Brian grinned and nodded.

"That's a great idea," he said. "Will you tell me about it after?"

She gave him a fierce look and laughed.

"You men are all alike!" she said as she punched him on the arm.

************************************************************

The whole week passed without Brian being able to add anything to his story. Firstly, he was trying to work out what should happen next. He decided to leave it alone to see if inspiration would strike. Secondly, he didn't get any opportunity to see or talk to Evelyn. That definitely took the wind out of his literary sails, at least for the moment.

He woke up on Saturday determined to add something to the story. He sat on the balcony sipping coffee and looking out over the neighborhood and letting his mind wander. 

After his second cup he realized that the neighborhood view was not going to provide any creative insights. 

He stared at the bottom of his cup for a few moments and frowned. 

He decided to go out for breakfast.

After eating he went to a shopping mall and looked around. He didn't buy anything and only ended up scowling at all the people bumping and walking into him. He grimaced with frustration and walked to his car.

He looked at the time and realized it was already midafternoon. 

His phone rang and he saw Evelyn's name on the call display. The Bluetooth engaged and her voice came through the car stereo clearly.

"Brian!" she exclaimed. "I'm so glad I caught you!"

"Me too," he said as he put his car into gear and left the parking lot.

"You won't believe what I've done!" she said breathlessly.

"Really?" he said with a chuckle. "It sounds important."

"It is!" she said emphatically. "You won't believe it! I don't believe it!"

"Okay," he said laughing, "why don't you tell me about it."

"My husband's car broke down," she said, "so I had to drive him to the golf club; actually, he drove, so I was in the passenger seat."

She started to giggle a little and her breathing was a little uneven.

"He parked in the lot," she said and lowered her voice to a whisper, "and he said he was ten minutes early. So I told him to sit back and relax."

Her giggling filled the car again and Brian could just imagine her blushing bright red.

"I put my hand on his," she stopped and choked back a guffaw, "I put it on his, um, you know. The look on his face was priceless! When I pulled it out he started trying to bat my hands away and he swore at me in Mandarin! It was so funny!"

Her snickering threatened to overpower her ability to be understood.

"I got it out and I," she giggled some more, "I put it in my mouth, and that's when he stopped fighting me."

She let out a loud chuckle and tittered for a minute.

"That's when I did it!" she said with feeling. "I took it in my mouth and I made him, you know, he gave me his, well, I swallowed every drop. I've never swallowed it for him before!"

"Really?" he asked. "Never?"

"Well," she said quietly, "not for him. 

"You should have seen the look on his face!" she went on with glee. "He looked like he was going to shout out loud or die or something!"

"Did he like what you did for him?" he asked with a grin.

"Are you kidding?" she said loudly. "He couldn't stop talking about it! He ended up being twenty minutes late for his tee time!"

"So you gave him a thrill," Brian said.

"You're telling me!" she said and burst into another fit of giggling.

"Wish I could have seen it," he said.

Evelyn stopped laughing in an instant.

"What?" she asked quietly.

"I wish I'd seen it," he said. "It sounds really hot. I would have liked to have been there,"

There was silence and Brian wondered if their call had been dropped.

"Evelyn?" he said.

"I'm here," she said quickly.

"Oh good," he said, "I was afraid we were..."

"Did you say you want to watch me with my husband?" she asked in a strangely subdued voice.

"Sure," he said. "That would be really sexy!"

There was another long pause.

"Oh," she said slowly. "I'll call you back."

[Open Doc]

Stuart held firmly to the back of Evelyn's head as she moved her mouth up and down on his cock. 

They were both fully dressed; only Stuart's erect member and Yvette's left breast were exposed. She gently pinched her own nipple and caressed her tit as she sucked him into the depths of her throat.

Stuart groaned and leaned back. Yvette redoubled her efforts on his cock and then he came. His semen shot into her mouth and she puffed her cheeks out to allow the hot fluid to fill it. She held onto his cockhead with her lips until he was finished shooting and then leaned back.

She was startled when Stuart pulled her to her feet, placed his lips against hers and pushed his tongue into her mouth.

Yvette's eyes went wide with surprise as he swirled his tongue around the inside of her mouth, pulling a fair amount of semen into his mouth.
