 David lived for days like this. When he worked from home, he could start the day at his own pace. For him, that meant lounging in bed with his laptop, watching a little porn, and rubbing one out before hitting the shower. He brewed a pot of coffee and checked his laptop to get up to speed on anything that may have happened overnight. No hot emails. It was going to be an awesome day! 

He took a quick peek at his calendarâ€”wide open except for a conference call at 1:00. And it was Wednesday. Not just any Wednesday, either. It was cleaning day at his place. That meant a visit from his sexy little housekeeper, Dana. If anyone asked, he would say his presence at his apartment while Dana was cleaning was a happy coincidence. In truth, David had stacked the work deck in his favor so he could be in the right place at the right time. For years, he had admired the view of Dana's gentle curves, especially as she scrubbed his floors. Too bad she was married... 

David launched a New Message window and shot a quick email to his friend, Kelsey. She'd appreciate his anticipation of Dana's visit.

I'm working from home today, which is always nice when I can pull it off. Turns out my managers are offsite for a meeting today. And since I have no meetings, it was an easy decision. A happy coincidence that it also happens to be cleaning day at my place. I often wonder if Dana knows I can just make out her lacy black bra beneath her tight t-shirts. Or does she know I'm stealing peeks of her from behind while she's scrubbing my floors? Too bad she's married. LOL 

I know I shouldn't look, but come on! 

Take care, 

David

It was just after eleven o'clock. In under two hours, he'd be knee-deep in a virtual team meeting and, with a little luck, catching a glimpse of Dana's tight, round ass. He sighed contently as he leaned back in his chair. He knew nothing could ever happen between them, but damn...she was definitely easy on the eyes! Determined to get at least some work done before his distraction, er, housekeeper, arrived, David signed onto the company's intranet to review the latest website metrics. Over the previous weekend, they had launched a completely revamped site. Glitches were to be expected. There were a couple of items that needed the team's prompt attention, so he made note of them on the legal pad he kept beside his laptop. Next, he pulled up sales stats from the previous night. He winced. Yeah, that wasn't gonna fly with senior management. He sketched out a few ideas that he wanted to run past his team, and then glanced at his phone. Perfect timing! He leaned back in his chair, put the legal pad on his lap, and connected to the conference line. 

David kicked off the meeting with a summary of both website and sales performance, then handed things over to Eli, his lead developer. Eli shared customer feedback he received since the site relaunch. They loved the more robust search engine, but had reported intermittent errors with the Contact Us form. As Eli started to pitch possible fixes, David found his mind wandering to Dana. Would she wear one of her tight graphic t's with a sassy saying on the front? Or would she wear that bright red blouse, unbuttoned just enough to draw attention to her generous cleavage? His laptop chimed, indicating the arrival of a new email message. It was from Kelsey.

Wouldn't it be hot if she came up behind you, caught you writing that email, fell into your lap, put your hand on a lace-clad breast, and claimed your mouth with hers? 

And then her hand would roam to your cock, already hard from watching her. She'd smile coyly and sink to her knees in front of you. Her delicate hands fumble with the zipper of your jeans. At last, she takes you into her warm mouth. Her enthusiasm leaves you no doubt that she wants you, too... 

Take care,

Holy shit. One of the other team members, Phillip, had started talking about ways to improve the site's bounce rate, and the only bouncing David could think of was Dana straddling him, riding him reverse cowgirl style, as his hands cupped her breasts. Fuck. He rubbed his face, desperately trying to regain focus. Kelsey's email combined with his vivid visions of Dana were almost enough to make him hard. This fucking conference call just needs to be over. David loved his job, but at that moment, he was more focused on the temptation of Dana. He'd never fuck another guy's wife, but that didn't mean he couldn't fantasize about it.

As David was pitching his ideas for boosting site conversion rates, he heard a soft knock at the door. Dana. After a few seconds, she let herself in. Her face lit up when she saw David, and his face lit up when he saw the way her "Reading is Sexy" t-shirt clung to her perky, round boobs. They exchanged smiles before David went back to his call and Dana got down to business. She started by dusting his desk. As she bent over to reach the far side of the desk, David caught the faint scent of perfume. It was a floral, feminine scent. From Victoria's Secret, maybe? He could have sworn he had smelled it before... And naturally his gaze lowered to her chest. He paused mid-sentence as he made out the subtle contours of her lacy bra as her breasts strained against the soft cotton of the t-shirt. Yep, he was officially hard. David made quick work of assigning each team member tasks before ending the call. 

By that point, Dana was on her hands and knees, scrubbing the floor of his tiny kitchen. He admired the view of her curvy ass and imagined taking her from behind. She's married, David, she's married. His cock stirred as he watched her. He reread Kelsey's email about Dana. It seemed slightly more virtuous than staring at a married woman and feeding all kinds of erotic fantasies. Unable to take it any longer, he quietly made his way to the bathroom. He unbuttoned his jeans and closed his eyes as rubbed his throbbing dick. What if she weren't married? Would they connect, or simply flirt? He sighed as he imagined sucking on those gorgeous breasts of hers. David tilted his head back as he wrapped his hand around his cock. A knock at the door startled him. Fuck, he couldn't let Dana know he was in there rubbing one out. In a panic, he stepped into the walk-in linen closet and closed the door. 

He heard Dana open the bathroom door and then scrub the toilet. It wasn't a glamourous task, but still, he wished he could watch her do it. The bath tub was next. He imagined the view of her bent over as she scrubbed. Finally, she turned her attention to the vanity, spraying it with cleaner, and then wiping it down. She opened the door to the linen closet to grab a towel to dry the countertop, and gasped as her hand came to rest on a rock-hard cock. She cried out in surprise and pulled her hand back. David could see her face through the crack of the door. Her shocked expression slowly dissolved into a sly smile as she reached in and touched him tentatively. He sucked in a sharp breath of air as her fingertips slowly traced the head of his cock. This was so wrong. There are lines you just don't cross, and yet he couldn't bring himself to stop her. 

Her touch felt so damn good, even better than he had imagined. She ran a finger slowly down his shaft to the base, and then gently cupped his balls. He wanted more than anything to scoop her up in his arms, take her to his bedroom, and explore every sexy inch of her body, but he knew he wouldn't. What they were already doing was bad enough. She moved her finger back to the head, where she spread the drop of pre-cum. Dana licked her lips, as if anticipating the taste of him. David wasn't sure which he wanted more, the feel of her mouth around him, or her to stop so her husband wouldn't kill him. She turned her body so that she could use both hands. Dana kept the closet door closed as much as possible. Perhaps avoiding eye contact made it feel like less of a betrayal to her husband? She put both hands around him, and gently twisted in opposite directions. Holy fuck! David wasn't normally a quiet lover, but somehow silence seemed in order. He held back a moan as she ran a hand firmly up and down his shaft, making him harder still. She worked him over well, twisting and sliding her hands, fondling his balls, and then coaxing him to climax. He stifled a primal growl of satisfaction as he came. 

Without uttering a single word, Dana went to the sink, washed her hands, and left the room. David knew they could never speak of this, and it certainly couldn't happen again. It was so wrong. It violated his moral code on so many levels... 

He could hear Dana vacuuming as he washed up. As he dried his hands, he decided that he'd go out there and act like nothing happened; that was clearly what she wanted, judging from the mostly closed closet door and her silent exit. 

"How are you doing today, Dana?" he asked awkwardly. 

She wound the cord around the vacuum. "Great, thanks." Neither made eye contact. 

"Great shirt, by the way," he smiled, nodding in her direction. "What do you like to read?" They had known each other for years, but never discussed their favorite authors. 

"Mostly Stephen King. I like scary stuff," she laughed. Like giving one of your clients a hand job when you're happily married? 

"Nice choice! I just finished reading his latest. I highly recommend it." Their conversation was so forced and awkward. The hand job was amazing, but he already missed their easy banter. 

Dana shoved her hands in the pockets of her jeans and shifted her weight nervously. "I should probably be going..." 

He was crushed. They nearly always had long, funny conversations whenever they saw each other. Now it seemed like she couldn't get away from him fast enough. 

"Hang on..." David pulled out his wallet and handed her some cash. "Here," he said, handing it to her. 

She looked down at the money. "This is way too much," she said, trying to hand a couple of the bills back to him. 

"No, I insist," he said, touching her hand. 

"But..." 

"You went above and beyond today. The place looks great. Thank you." 

At last, they made eye contact and exchanged a knowing look. Dana folded the money and stuck it in her back pocket. "Thank you, Mr. Michaels." There was a tinge of disappointment in her tone. 

"It's David. My dad is Mr. Michaels," he grinned. "I thought we settled this years ago." 

"David it is!" She smiled and disappeared out the door without another word. 

He wandered out to the kitchen as he replayed the hand job in his mind. The subtle smell of flowers intensified his recollection of the experience. Would Dana tell her husband? What would happen the next time they saw each other? Would things be awkward. Or would they be able to move past it? 

David reached into the fridge and grabbed a Coke. He needed to get at least some work done today, and it was clear he was going to need a caffeinated boost. As he walked toward his desk, the scent of her perfume grew stronger. He looked around the room and quickly noticed why. Dana's trench coat was laying over the back of the sofa. His presence must have caught her off guard enough that she forgot to hang it up in the closet next to the door. He set his drink on the desk, and then went over and picked up the coat. He breathed in the scent of her. Her husband was a lucky sonofabitch. He hung the coat up, and then went back to his desk in the corner of the living room. 

Shit! He was second-guessing the little cash bonus he gave her. Not the best move; she might have taken it as him paying for sexual favors, and he had to concede that it certainly looked that way. He sighed and shook his head. Hopefully his fears were unfounded, because he couldn't exactly clarify things when he saw her next. He knew they could never speak of today again. They had crossed lines they shouldn't have. 

David sat down and drafted a summary of their conference call along with a list of team assignments and target deadlines. As he hit Send, there was a knock at the door. 

Fuck! I'm a dead man! His pulse raced as he contemplated whether to answer the door, or ignore it. A second knock. He took a deep breath to calm himself. Easy, David. There's no way she could have gotten to her husband that quickly. And would she even tell him what happened anyway? She was the one who initiated things. David wasn't completely blameless to be sure, but Dana was definitely in command of the situation. She could have walked away, but she didn't. Instead, she gave him the most exquisite hand job he had had in probably years. He found himself imagining her beautiful, full lips around his cock. 

The front door opened slowly. Dana! She was the only one who had a key to his apartment besides the landlord. He breathed a sigh of relief. 

She stuck her head in the door and smiled shyly. "Hey, is it okay if I come in? I forgot my coat..." 

"Of course!" David's expression brightened as he went to the closet and pulled the garment off the hanger. He folded the floral-scented coat over his arm as he walked toward her. "It was really good seeing you today, Dana." They locked eyes. "I always enjoy our conversations." Idiot. You didn't even talk that much today! 

She flashed that irresistible smile of hers. "Me, too. You're easily my favorite client." 

He tilted his head and grinned. "I am, huh?" Try not to read too much into it, he cautioned himself. She's married. 

"Indeed, you are." The tension lightened considerably. It was obvious they were both trying to find ways to prolong their conversation. "You're fuckin' hysterical!" She slapped her hand over her mouth, eyes wide with shock at her use of the f-bomb. She prided herself on always acting professionally. 

David laughed at her adorable reaction. "Relax," he teased. "I've heard far worse." He contemplated winking, but thought better of it. She's married. He had to keep reminding himself of that, especially since he really wanted to bend her over the back of the sofa and fuck her hard and fast. 

She blushed. "You always know how to make me laugh, and believe me, there are days that's no easy feat." 

"I'm glad." He lived to make people laugh. David handed her the coat, touching her hands in the process. They locked eyes as their contact lingered a bit longer than it probably should have. She's married. He saw a brief look of sadness cross her face. "Are you okay?" He gave her hand a quick squeeze. 

She swallowed hard and waved off his concern. "Yeah, I'm okay." Was she about to cry? 

"You didn't say that with much conviction..." 

She shifted nervously. "Really. I'm fine. I should be going. Thank you for everything." 

"No, thank you!" Dana was speaking in choppy sentences and fidgeting way more than usual. Of course, he hadn't seen her in a few weeks, but still...something felt very off. "I'm worried about you, Dana." 

"I'm okay," she insisted as she slipped into the coat and tied the belt. 

He just wanted to wrap his arms around her and make whatever was bothering her better. 

"See you soon," she said with a quick wave as she walked out the door. 

David had the feeling Dana was going to be on his mind a lot over the next few days. She wasn't nearly as flirty as usual, and their conversations were strained. But most of all, he had never seen her look so sad; she was always so bubbly. God, he hoped she wasn't regretting the hand job. Maybe he should have put a stop to it... Knowing that he couldn't change what happened, David headed back to his desk to put in a couple more hours of work. 

~ ~ ~ 

The following two weeks passed surprisingly quickly. David found himself wondering how Dana was doing quite often. It was agonizing resisting the urge to contact her. It was Dana day once more. He would have loved to have been home when she came, but he had some meetings that couldn't occur remotely. David grabbed the case holding his work laptop and made his way to his car. He turned the key to the ignition. Nothing. He tried again. Silence. Damnit! Thank God for AAA! Hopefully they'd arrive on time for him to make his first meeting. He placed the call from his cell phone only to learn that they were at least two hours out. With a heavy sigh, he grabbed his laptop and went back to his apartment. As he was unlocking the door, his phone rang. It was Dana. 

"Dana, hi! What's up?" he asked. David wanted to ask if she was okay, but didn't because he hoped that whatever was bothering her had long since been ironed out. 

"I'm good, thanks. Would it be okay if dropped over a little early today? I don't want to interrupt any work calls, but I had to shift my schedule a bit to work around a client's book club meeting she's hosting." 

"Go for it! Though I have to warn you, I might still be here waiting for AAA. My car wouldn't start this morning." 

"All the better! I could use a few good laughs today." 

He could hear the smile in the tone of her voice. The thought of making her laugh made him grin. "Awesome. I hope to see you soon then." 

They disconnected the call as he set up his laptop on his desk. He'd shoot off a few emails to reschedule the earliest meetings, and then begin his daily check of website metrics and product sales. As he opened his email program, he found an unread message from Kelsey.

David laughed out loud. Kelsey said "fuck" and "suck" in a single sentence, and knowing the way her mind worked, he was certain the double entendres were intentional. He shook his head as he navigated to the web metrics control panel. He was pleased to see the continuing decline in bounce rate, and was thrilled to see sales were up a few percentage points. The changes they mapped out during that conference call had worked beautifully! 

He heard a soft knock at the door. AAA would have called first; it must be Dana. He tried not to get too excited, as he reminded himself for like the millionth time that she's married. 

"Come on in, Dana!" he called out, cringing slightly at his use of the word "come" and the graphic images it conjured up in his mind. 

She let herself in and stood just inside the door, wearing her khaki colored trench coat. David looked over at her and smiled.
