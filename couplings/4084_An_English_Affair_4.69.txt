 Foreword: 

The following story is fiction, but based upon recent real life events. While it does not contain details of graphic sex, the reader should be over eighteen years of age. In order to protect the innocent, and otherwise, names have been changed. I would like to dedicate my story to all unhappily married women and in particular the real Rebecca with whom, under different circumstances, we might have turned fantasy into fact. Probably a story we could all tell once in a lifetime.
