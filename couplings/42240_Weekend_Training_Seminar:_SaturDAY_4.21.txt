The next morning I'm downstairs... in the big conference room... where the company has provided a spread of coffee and pastries... As I enter I scan the room... but you aren't there... I feel a twinge of regret... But anticipation quickly replaces it... Excitedly I wonder how you will dress today... how you will display your hot little body...

I don't have long to wait...

I'm taking a sip of coffee when you stroll through the doors... I freeze with my cup at my lips... my heart races... my cock twitches... You have chosen a common business outfit... soft white blouse, grey pencil skirt, black stockings and heels... But on you it is anything but common... The garments hug your body... slither over your curves... you are a goddess... an erotic goddess...

A second later you spot me... your sly little smile beams my way... it sparkles with the mischief in your smoldering eyes.

I am flooded... by memories... memories of last night... memories of you... My nerves scream... my breath catches... my cock jumps... I want you... I want you so bad...

But I have to wait...

We are here for business... for training... for our careers... So I tell myself to be patient... to wait...

I find an aisle seat... A couple rows away you claim one also... Then the morning begins... lectures and presentations... For me it is agonizing... I watch you... Watch your legs stretch out from beneath your skirt... stare at them reaching down... I watch them cross... your nylons... re-cross... your heels... and cross again... I watch you shift in your seat... your hot body... your small shoulders... your beautiful hair... Through the opening in the chair-back I can see your sweet little ass... I am becoming aroused... excited.... So excited...

In a room filled with our colleagues... With a corporate trainer lecturing from the stage... my focus is on you... only you... I stare... I watch... I imagine... I remember...

Several times I have to shift in my own seat... the memories and thoughts inside my head cause a reaction... inside my pants. 

The minutes drag on... hours crawl by... finally it's time for a break... a chance to stretch our legs... grab a fresh drink... Everyone spreads out... people going this way and that... I loose all sense of where you are momentarily... and I feel a twinge of fear... How have you done this to me?... So easily?... So quickly?...

But then I sense a presence beside me... I glance over... It's you... You are at my side... smiling... that mischievous sparkle in your eyes... I feel your hand... at my jacket pocket...

Something to help you get through these next couple of hours.

Then you walk away... I watch your ass sway as you do...

I'm nervous... like never before... I hurry to the men's room... I fight to keep my hand from diving into my pocket while I'm surrounded... Once in a stall I reach in... my fingers touch lace... soft lace... I pull out a pair of panties... your panties. They're black and sexy... so much sexier because they are here... because you put them in my pocket... you're so naughty... so dirty... Mesmerized I stare at them... and I notice something... at their crotch... a darker shade... I touch it... it's damp... Not wet, but damp... slightly... lifting them I inhale... My cock twitches in my pants... It's you... your sweetness... your essence... so hot... so sweet... 

Memories of your shifting legs flood my mind... the delicate stems crossing and re-crossing... you are also aroused... your body shifting through the ache... Again I sniff your panties... your aroma... you...

You're such a tease... Such a hot little tease...

I return to my seat... to suffer through more speakers... I hear them even less than earlier... My mind is not on them... it's not on their words... it's not on their slides... It's on you... on your body... your sex... your wetness... I shift in my seat again... my cock is throbbing... growing stiff within my pants... I reach into my jacket pocket... my fingers fondle your panties... I love your brashness... As I glance your way I catch your eye... you're turned toward me... a sly little grin on your lips...

Lunch break... finally... A cold cut smorgasbord has been set up... our colleagues form neat, organized lines on either side of the table. 

Uninterested in the food I look for you... I want contact... To hell with the discomfort... forget the aching pain of my constrained cock... you fuel things in me I have never felt before... you have awakened my deepest lust...

I spot you... you're across the room... by the wall... by a closet door... You see me... your eyes sparkle... your lips in that naughty little grin... You open the closet door... and quickly disappear... My cock leaps inside my pants...You're being naughty... So naughty... And you're inviting me... To join you... I struggle not to rush across the room... force myself to stroll there casually... It's hard... Oh so hard... 

I grab the door handle... my heart pounding in my chest... I pull it open... and slip inside... It's a storage closet... walls lined by metal shelves... But they don't matter to me... only what is in the center... Standing... waiting... You... dressed so sexily... your body covered by the business suit... your curves so enticing... Your eyes smoldering... They say all that I need to hear...

We come together... slam our bodies together... our hands grabbing... our fingers scratching... our lips melding... our tongues swirling... all in a frenzy... a frenzy of mutual hunger... and lust... My one hand grabs your waist... pulls your body against mine... The other presses at the back of your head... pushing your lips against mine...Your hands are on my shoulders... lifting you up to meet me... You grind your body against me... into me... We pant... we gasp... Hands grabbing... fingers scratching... grabbing... scratching... panting... gasping... 

Oh god... I want you, Baby... I want you inside me...

Our lips lock together again... our mouths hungry... our tongues diving... We force our bodies to part slightly... to allow our hands in between them... Yours drag themselves down off my shoulders... they're heavy against my chest... Your find my shirt buttons... work at them... quickly... your fingers plucking them open... My own hands find your blouse buttons as well... pulling at them... Tucked into your skirt only the bottom is soon held closed... Your tits are displayed... the lacey bra cradling them... I reach inside... my fingers cup your tits... my palms flatten them... I squeeze... fondle... My thumbs slide beneath your bra's material... they tickle your swollen nipples... Your breathing grows heavier... deeper... 

I pull away from your lips... drop to the crook of your neck... I kiss your flesh... your scent fills my nose... I kiss... I nibble... your shoulder... kiss... your neck... nibble... your collarbone... 

My shirt is open... Your hands reach down to find my belt... undo it... then the button beneath... the zipper... You reach inside... your hand delving into my shorts... You grab me... Your fingers grip at me... grip my stiffening cock... They wrap around my shaft... your delicate fingers... pulling... tugging...

My hands move away from your tits... they grab at your skirt... jerk at the material... pull it up... You shift your body... you shimmy... You're assisting me... together we lift your skirt... it bunches at your waist... You are exposed... bared to me... and to anyone that might open the door...

We stumble slightly... Your legs are weak... mine are jumpy... We shift about... our bodies twist... My hand dives between your legs... my fingers caress your opening... pet at your swollen labia... Your juices coat them... your wetness opening you for them... Your fingers tighten upon my cock... squeezing it... tugging at it... 

Yes... Oh god yes, Baby...

We move you back... back against some boxes.... I push you against them... lift you up... raise your feet off the floor... and set you on the boxes... You spread your legs... My fingers dance at the edge of your opening... your wetness coats them... your hungry sex tries to suck them inside of you... Your free hand grabs my waist and tries to pull me into you... in between your spread legs... You open yourself... further... Your hand pulls at my cock... your fingers tug... and jerk...

Reluctantly I pull my hand from your sex... You whimper quietly... I grab the waist of my pants... jerk them down... My cock is free... You pull at it... guide it... toward you... toward your pussy... your wet little pussy...

Your hair is in my face... my lips at your shoulder... I kiss... nip... nibble... You sigh... moan... whimper...

The tip of my cock brushes at your opening... between your swollen labia... You are wet... hungry... I press forward... You open for me... Your juices smooth my entrance... they coat and lube my shaft... The first inches of me penetrate you... You sigh... 

You want it, slut?... You want my cock filling your dirty little pussy?...

Yes... Oh yes, Baby... Fill me with your cock... Fill my dirty little pussy...

I press forward... Soon I am completely buried inside you... Our crotches meet... grind against one another... You feel good... so good... Your wetness... the velvety grip of your pussy on my rigid shaft... You whimper... Your hips jerk slightly... You reach under my shirt... around my back... and your fingers scratch at my flesh... your nails digging into my skin... Your head lulls back... your eyes are closed... your lips parted... You whimper... your body grinding against me...

Yes, you like that, don't you whore?... You like having my cock buried in your cunt... Filling your hot little pussy...

Yes, Baby... Oh yes...

I pull back... slowly... withdrawing... inches... of my cock... Then I stop... just the head remains... the walls of your pussy holding it... cupping it... I pause... just for a moment... your hips quiver slightly upon the boxes... your body displayed before me... Small whimpers coming from your parted lips... 

Such a dirty little bitch...

I shove my hips forward... drive my cock into you... I slam it into you... into your cunt... It fills you... rapidly... Stuffing you with its hardness... Your body quivers... shifts... it jerks upon the boxes... You suck in your breath... moan...

Oh God... Oh god yes...

I fill my hand with your hair... my fingers gripping the tresses... I jerk your head forward... cram your face into my chest... Your moans... your whimpers... become muffled... 

Oh yes... Oh god yes...

I pump myself into you... feed you my cock... again... and... again...

You're a dirty little whore... A cock hungry little bitch... You like having my cock in you... love having it in your pussy... You loved having it in your ass last night too... and swallowing my cum... And now your loving it in your dirty little snatch... You filthy bitch... Nasty ass whore...

Oh yes... Oh god yes...

We try to be quiet... Mindful of the door that is all that separates us from the others... Your teeth clamp onto me... lock onto my chest... You whimper into me... into my body... into my flesh...

Oh yes... Oh yes... Oh god yes...

I lean down... place my lips next to your ear...

Yes you are... you're a filthy little whore... A cock sucking bitch with a hungry little pussy... You like my cock... you like me fucking you... Fucking you like the slut that you... You dirty little bitch-whore...

I drive myself into you...

You respond... push yourself at me... rocking upon the boxes... Each time I drive forward... you meet me... Our crotches meet... then I pull back again... only to shove myself forward again... Your legs come up... wrap around my waist...

We work up a rhythm... driving... humping... fucking...

Your teeth... clench... tighter... biting me... Your nails... dig... harder... at my back...

Sounds come from our crotches... dirty sounds... wet sounds... fucking sounds... We fuck... harder... faster... Our bodies... pounding together... driving... pounding... slamming... You whimper... pant... Your face is firmly against my chest... my flesh between your teeth...

Yes, take my cock you whore... Take my fucking cock in your pussy... Take it like the dirty slut you are... Take it... Take it, you bitch...

You moan... you gasp... you pant... Our pace... builds... and... builds... You're hot... dirty... lustful...

We pound... we thrust... we drive...

Your orgasm nears... your pussy tightens around my shaft... clenching... squeezing... milking... Pulling me closer to my own orgasm... Your teeth... biting... Your nails... digging... My fingers in your hair... tangled.... wrenching... as I shove your face into me... You moan into my chest... whimper...

You whimper... your body tensing... Your orgasm... starts to explode... through you... starts to crash... along your nerves... and wash over your senses... You legs lock... holding me as tightly into you as possible... I quiver in your grasp... my hips twitching to pump my cock into you... just... one... more... time...

Oh, fuck yea...

My hand shoves your face into my chest... my other one squeezes your ass... Your orgasm rockets through you... your pussy clenches... milks my cock... Suddenly I explode... inside you... my cock jerking... my seed spraying...

You're a naughty little whore...

We hold each other tight as our orgasms explode... then begin to fade...After a couple minutes we pull apart... smiling... satisfied... mischievous... We fix our clothes... smooth them out as best we can... You're the first to leave... I wait a few... then follow... No one seems to notice... It seems we're safe... we've gotten away with it... with our little rendezvous...

During the afternoon break you approach me...

I'll come to your room tonight...
