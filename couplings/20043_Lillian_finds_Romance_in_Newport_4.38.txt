 Lily Anne, Lillian to her family, Lil to her closest friends, had just moved to Newport, Rhode Island at the urging of her best friend. Cindy had been so positive with her encouragements. "Move away, even for a while," she had urged, "Get away Lil, find a fresh start and a new love. Baby, you need to not be you," she continued, "So relax, go to the seashore, maybe find a nude beach." Then she added with a wicked grin, "Maybe find yourself a sailor and take him for a real ocean ride." 

"Great," Lil found herself talking out loud. "'A fresh start' she said. All I really have is a broken heart, no friends and NO prospects."
