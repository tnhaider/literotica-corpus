 Five days in Seattle didn't clear Ryan's head. Instead, they intensified his confusion.

He wanted Rose like he wanted the neurons in his brains to keep firing, like he wanted his body to convert food to energy. Not just to fuck her—but, yes, of course to fuck her—but he just wanted her... present, in a deep, primitive way. So he could talk to her, hold her—so he could think about something else, and not have to wonder if his house manager, or one of the construction staff, or any of the dozen maintenance workers who came in and out of his house on a daily basis, or her goddamned next door neighbor or what the fuck did he know, anyone, was experiencing her.

He knew it was hypocritical—given the ring on his finger—to be so obsessed with Rose's fidelity to him. But the thought of another man...

He couldn't even finish the thought. He'd believed he was a good man. Since what he'd done to Jillian, he'd tried desperately to be. He knew he had no rights, where Rose was concerned. But he had no choices, here, and it was killing him to think that she did—that she might be choosing someone else while he was sitting in a hotel room in Seattle, drinking and trying to keep himself from going back to her.

Fuck it. She had a choice. Then—so did he, even if it wasn't much of one. He'd lay it before her and see if he could keep her in his life, for a little while longer yet.
