 I sat down behind my desk and a sinking feeling took over my entire body. Was he serious? It had been four long weeks and he hadn't once acknowledged me. Yet another shared meeting and not a smile, not one inane greeting, not a single glance in my direction. Did I imagine the whole thing? I found that hard to believe as images of his wolf like hazel brown eyes turned into a dark storm of desire flashed through my mind. Surely the instant bolt of pleasure to every erogenous zone, every time his image slammed to the forefront of my mind couldn't be fantasy alone?

Clearly it was time to move on. Who did he think he was anyway? In reality I didn't really see why he'd captured my attention. He didn't sound that smart in the meeting today when he failed to satisfactorily answer some of the questions the CEO was asking. And wasn't that my first rule, never have sex with a man you can't respect? Yes that's right. The questions were a little ridiculous though and now that I thought of it, it actually wasn't his area of responsibility. He was probably trying to cover for James again, who, if he ever bothered to turn up was generally dozing off or busy eating all the mints.

My fantasy man had looked handsome at this morning's meeting though, with his ever present sexy grin on those full luscious lips that begged for attention. I loved the hint of almost vulnerability that ghosted across his eyes when he thought he wasn't being watched and the way his hair appeared ruffled leaving the impression of frustration through the dark feathered strands. His strong capable hands as they cupped my hips and forced me up against his hard throbbing cock. Whoa! What? Damn. There I go again. I had to snap out of these arousing trances.
