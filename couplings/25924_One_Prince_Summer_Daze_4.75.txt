 One Prince Summer Daze

The lazy, hazy daze of Summer...

Author's note: Sorry this is getting in so late...Real Life has a way of interfering with important things, like writing. This is a mostly softcore continuation of the stories "One Prince of Serendip," my submission for the 2018 Nude Day contest, and "One Prince Revisited," my submission for the 2018 Summer Lovin' contest. You may want to read those first. Or not. Like "Revisited," this is ending up to be a long one, since it covers several weeks. As before, regardless of inspiration, this story is fiction, and if you think you recognize yourself in it, don't worry about it...no one else should. Again, I'm putting this in Erotic Couplings, although I often have a hard time deciding between that and Romance. If I've picked the wrong category, please don't let it affect your enjoyment. Thanks for reading, and I particularly appreciate voting and constructive comments, regardless of any contest. That's how I know how well I am pleasing you, the reader. Oh, and any character actually having sex is at least eighteen years old. Cheers!

 She stepped out of a rainbow, golden hair shining like moonglow,Warm lips, soft as her soul, sitting here by me, now...She's here by me.

All summer long we were dancing in the sand.And the jukebox kept on playing "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band"
