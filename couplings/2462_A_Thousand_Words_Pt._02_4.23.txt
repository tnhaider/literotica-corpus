 The Loft: 

Rhea mulled over the events of the recent past as she drove towards her destination. More so than yoga, it was driving that gave her a sense of tranquil. Especially when she was driving her black Porsche Cayenne, which she affectionately referred to as The Pearl. She turned off the main road and sped down an almost empty inroad towards the old industrial park outside of the central city.

The day that had passed was certainly uneventful, and yet, laced with excitement. Soon after she received the present, Rhea set about fulfilling her commitments for the day and wrapping things up by late afternoon. The lack of activity after that did little to curb her desires to call the rakish photographer and speak to him about the plans for the evening. Her desire, however, was cut short by a call from her husband. She smirked at the memory of the brief but colorful conversation she had. 

"You and your FAT ASS can go to hell for all I care. You hear me?"

Rhea listened to the rantings of her husband via the speakerphone as she selected dresses for the evening. 

"I see, and where are you currently my love?"

"Oh! so it's 'My love' now is it?" her husband mocked, "Well, you can forget about trying to figure out where I am because you're not the boss of me."

Rhea sighed and looked at the speakerphone with both disgust and sympathy. (The alliances we make to get ahead in life) she mused and resumed trying out dresses.

"Well, wherever you are I hope you're having a good time."

"I'm having the time of my life. I always have and I always will, you hear me?"

"Loud and clear my dear. Just go easy on the booze and take your pills on time. Oh and try not to get another infection. Spend some extra money and get a proper, clean whore for yourself."

The call ended abruptly, and Rhea shook her head and chuckled. She finally selected a simple black cocktail dress that both complimented her figure and subsequently, her car. After having cleared her head of her husband's phone call, she finally called the number on the back of the card.

Driving down the empty road, she glanced around at the bleak surroundings. Abandoned buildings, old factories, busted street lamps, the area, was, but a shadow of its former self. Strange location for a residence, but then again, the man was not exactly someone who would be comfortable with what people considered 'normal.' The barren surroundings lent a bit of flavor to the evening, as a desert does to an oasis.

She found the address that was dictated to her over the phone. On the outside, it looked like an old abandoned warehouse unit. The length of the building took up an entire block. (Ideal for a photo-studio), Rhea thought and slid her vehicle into the spacious parking lot. Looking at how crowded the parking lot was already, she concluded that she was perhaps the last guest to arrive, and then smirked at the possibility that it was perhaps by design.

As she entered the party, the sheer expanse of the place awed her. The interior decorations were both tasteful and functional, and not a single space was left empty or unadorned. For tonight's little soiree the bulk of the studio was converted into a make-shift gallery, showcasing various erotic and semi-naked nude portraits positioned upon easels and hung on the dry brick walls.

Rhea floated through the party floor with practiced ease and precision. Speaking with men and women, that exuded a certain aura of intelligence and importance. The combination of her wit and beauty ensured that she was allowed entry into almost every little circle of conversation that took place in the party. Her real interest, however, lay in locating the mysterious host, who thus far remained elusive from her sights. 

She was held under siege by an unusually loud and ill-mannered patron when suddenly she felt a smooth but firm hand upon her shoulder followed by a soft greeting, "I'm glad you could make it."

She turned around to find the rake from the night before standing in front of her. Dressed in an immaculate black suit, without a tie and two buttons open to show a tuft of blonde chest hair. 

"I'm glad I was invited," Rhea answered with a relieved smile and gladly allowed the host to cut in between her and the rather annoying guest who was moments ago boring her to death. 

Her host handled him with ease, "Ah! Dr. Gupta, so glad you're enjoying the party, I must tell you, however, that your wife has been asking after you for some time now. Perhaps you'd like to meet up with her at the exit?" he led the man away and returned to Rhea with a flute of champaign. 

"An excellent customer Dr. Gupta. He's bought four pieces this evening."

"Pity they can't purchase some manners," Rhea quipped and sipped her drink. 

"Sounds like you say this from experience."

"Something like that.", she sipped her drink and continued to peruse the gallery, with the host at her elbow.

The host's eyes once again were captivated by her gait. The subtle sway of her hips, and the gentle bounce of her ass cheeks. The artist in him would gaze at her with admiration and awe. But tonight, he was not an artist, but a rake. His mind swirled with images of the two of them locked in a naked and sweaty embrace. The flutter of her eye lids, the marks of his hands on her hips and asscheeks, the guttrual and almost feral grunts that would accompany their night of pleasure. He was shaken out of his dream when he realized that he was standing several feet away from her as she continued her slow and sensuous stroll down his gallery. 

He made his way back to her elbow and adjusted his crotch, which had thickened significantly in the last few seconds. Rhea's walk came to a halt as she turned around to face him. The champagne flute hovering close to her blood red lips, "You realize that I don't even know your name?" 

The question caught the man off guard. Letting out a nervous chuckle he replied, "Well, I let my works do my introduction for me."

"Not good enough I'm afraid." Rhea countered and sipped on her drink. Her green eyes never leaving his blue. She nodded at the portraits, "I noticed that you don't even sign your work. No watermark, no symbol. Aren't you afraid of plagarism?" 

"I have safeguards in place to prevent that. I'm not someone who displays my work openly. Gatherings such as this are, well, rare occurances." The blue gaze of his eyes took on a sharper edge as he uttered, "Rare occurances for unique pleasures."

"Indeed?" She raised her eyebrow and smirked flirtatiously.

"Quite." He replied with an equally mischevious smile.

"And what unique pleasure do you look to gain out of this gathering?", Rhea asked while admiring the portrait of a woman squirming sensuously on a bed of satin sheets.

The host's eyes trailed down the curve of her spine, settled on the bulbous asscheeks. Moving ahead of her, the gaze fell to her cleavage without fear of detection and lingered as the man admired the swell and curves of her breasts, "Well, I consider myself an artist, and the greatest pleasure any artist can have, is an inspiration." The eyes perused her body once more with unabashed lust before locking gazes with. A playful smirk upon the man's lips. 

Rhea sipped her drink and whispered, "I believe we began with the subject of your name."

"And I believe the longer I keep my name from you, the longer you'll be interested in staying." 

"You should be careful. Not all women enjoy being teased and tantalized." Her gaze took on a firmer and icy quality. The man's smirk was effectively wiped off of his lips, and he nodded with a mix of respect and fear.

"I Shall keep that in mind for later." His smirk returned, as did his arrogance. With a lingering glance at her body, the host withdrew to attend to his other guests.

The rest of the evening passed without much incident. The guests began to filter out of the room and soon the only car remaining in the garage was a black Porche Cayenne.

Rhea stood at the panoramic window located in the upper loft and admired the evening city skyline in the distance. She recalled the same visage from some of her host's photographs. (He certainly isn't short on material for inspiration) 

Soft fingertips gently slid over the curve of her spine and fanned out towards her shoulder-strap, breaking her reverie. She flinched and looked over her shoulder to find the owner of the loft standing naked, with only the bare minimum of light illuminating portions of his toned physique. She turned around to face him, "I'm glad you took my advice on teasing and tantalizing a woman.", she whispered with a smirk and slid her fingers along his sides and stroked his thighs and waist.

In reply, he slipped her shoulder-straps down her arms and watched her dress pool around the heels. Eyes taking in the thickness of her thighs, the flare of her hips and the fullness of her breasts. With a soft moan, he slid his hands around her waist and slowly stroked the ass cheeks.

"Lord have mercy." he groaned as his palms cupped and weighed each cheek. Rhea giggled and slid her finger nails down his pale, smooth chest and over the muscle ridges of his abdomen. She felt him bounce her cheeks in his palm before slowly squeezing them as if to make sure they are real and natural. Rhea slowly moved them to the foot of the bed and then pushed him onto it. Standing before him she slipped out of her heels and rolled her feet with a sigh of relief, "Sex with heels on is overrated." 

Her lover grinned and leaned back onto his hands. Letting his shaft twitch and stand somewhat erect. Rhea made her way between his legs and looked up at you. She gripped the shaft with one hand and stroked it up and down slowly, while her head tilted to one side and her tongue curled and slurped on his smooth, ballsack. Tasting his flesh and savoring every morsel. 

His head, like his eyes, rolled back with a groan. One of his hands rested on her head as her tongue moved over and under his scrotum before she finally opened her mouth to take the whole of his sack inside. Running her teeth and tongue along the smooth skin, she slipped his sack out her mouth and slid her tongue up the underside of his shaft and flicked the little blob of precum on his tip. Never breaking eye-contact, she stroked his shaft firmly and ran her thumb under his cock-head before wrapping her lips around the cock-tip and sucking slowly.

"Awwww fffuckk!!!!", The veneer of a gentleman slipped out his grasp, and he let his vocabulary run wild as he enjoyed her technique. Her head bobbed deeper and deeper, and the grip around his shaft tightened every so slightly with every downward descent of her head. Her other hand cupped and stroked his smooth ballsack in tune to her mouth's suction. The bedroom walls soon echoing the wet sound of her lips dragging up and down the veins of the shaft, along with the deep groans of the owner it's owner. She looked up at him, and the glint of mischief in her green eyes was unmistakable. She flashed her teeth and sank them into the meat with a throaty growl and tugged his shaft upwards, causing him to grip the sheets tight with one hand and grab a handful of her hair in the other. 

His toes curled into tight balls as he fought for control. Persperation lining his back and forehead, "Where have you been all my life?", He asked the ceiling as he threw his head back and shivered with pleasure. Her tongue slipped out from underneath the shaft, and her throat expanded to swallow his not inconsiderable length with ease. She hummed loudly around his cock, making it tremble inside her throat. Pulling her head back up she popped the now wet and slick cock-head out and ran her fingers expertly up and down the shaft. Spreading her saliva evenly along the length. 

He looked at her with eyes dripping with lust, "I think I've been teased and tantilized enough." He whispered with flared nostrils and a heaving, slightly damp chest. Wiping the edges of her lips, Rhea stood and tucked her thumbs into the straps of her thong. Pushing it down she stepped onto the wooden floorboards, her slit glistening and letting off a musky scent. 

His hands came forward to catch her waist and slid down over the curves to caress her ass cheeks. He kissed between her breasts and began leaving a wet trail with his tongue tip. As his teeth gently sank into her throat, he pulled her onto his lap and felt her wet slit slide up against the length of his shaft. Her nails dug into the flesh of his back, and with a guttural moan she began to swivel her hips back and forth on his lap and teased his shaft with her pussy. With a loud groan, he delivered a loud spank on one of her bulbous ass cheeks and then the other and felt the hot skin against his palms before his hands began to grope and knead them. 

She wrapped her thighs around his waist. In the dim light, the sheen of sweat on her body gave off a faint glow. She raised her hips gently and slipped a palm between them and stroked his eager shaft from balls to cocktip and then held it upright. Looking into his eyes, she gently lowered herself onto his manhood and felt her pussy lips clamp around his cock and swallow it inside with a hunger of their own.

They both let out an audible gasp at the moment of entry. Rhea's hand on his back gripped the pale flesh, and his hands on her ass squeezed the cheeks tighter. She continued her descent until she felt her pelvis bounce against his. She arched her back and slowly shook her hips side to side and adjusted her position before lifting back up and dropping down again, and again, and again. Never breaking eye contact while she grunted after every drop and felt his cock slide in deeper and deeper and throb within the confines of her walls. 

His eyes widened with ecstacy as did his mouth. He listened to the rhythmic thumping of the wet slit against his pelvis and took in the scent of their musk wafting up from between them.

"Yeaahhh!!!" he managed to groan as he let his eyes roll back and he felt the walls of her pussy clinch his cock-meat in a vice-like grip. Feeling the tug of her pussy every time she lifted her hips and then the slow but hard clash of her thighs when she dropped them.

Her fingers locked behind his neck as she grunted and gave a lascivous grin. Her breasts swaying up and down with the momentum of her torso, her thighs opening up everytime she lifted her body and then closing in when she sank back down the cock. She was in control as if she had planned every moment since he first approached her at the exhibition.

As his eyes regained their focus, he dipped his head and began feeding on her breasts. Catching a nipple bud in his teeth and softly chewing, tugging and ultimately sucking on it while she bounced on his cock. The floorboards, like the bed, began to creak slightly at the constant onslaught of their sexual activity. The groans were muffled against her breasts as he changed nipples and started sucking with renewed vigor. 

Rhea threw her head back sharply as she felt her sensitive nipple buds being suckled expertly. She raked his back with her nails and dropped her hips down hard and then rolled her body in a slow circle. With an urgent grunt, he spun their bodies and put her on her back and entered her with a hard thrust of his hips. Looking into Rhea's eyes, he began to enter and exit her pussy at a faster pace. The arousal in his eyes made him look like a man who fully consumed by his lust. She wrapped her legs around him and locked her ankles. Leaning up she bit into his shoulder as he humped her like an animal in heat.

The sounds of their grunts and moans echoed loudly in the mostly empty loft apartment. The headboard soon became a victim of her passion as Rhea clung onto it, bent at the waist, while her lover entered her ass, with his hands resting firmly on her flared hips and his pelvis slapping noisily against her full ass cheeks. She slipped her legs over his calves and anchored her body against the constant motion of his hips.

A hand gripped Rhea's hair and tugged it backwards gently, "Oh you've done this several times I see," he managed to breathe out while slowing his movements. In reply, Rhea looked over her shoulder with a confident smirk and rolled her ass in a circle, while still holding onto his cock with her sphincter.

"Holy sh...." he gasped and watched his cock being taken for a ride by her ass. He pressed her body flat against the bed with his on top, his hands circling her body and groping her breasts as his body began to spasm. With a satisfied hiss, Rhea received his hot cum inside her ass and used her sphicter muscles to milk his shaft slowly. She felt her lover's orgasm subside and his heavy breath in her ear, after which she loosened her grip on his cock and allowed him to extract it from her ass.

He fell onto his back, and Rhea could see the sweat shining on his torso, but he wore a satisfied grin upon his lips as he took deep, calming breaths. She slid close to him and slowly ran a hand down and up his body and rubbed his chest, "You still haven't told me your name." She whispered.

The man looked at her and gave her a slow lingering kiss before replying, "Adam... my name is Adam." Rhea looked down at his pale naked body and nodded, "Seems appropriate." She kissed him again and slid her thigh over his waist.

As he caressed her thigh he felt a sudden rough patch on her skin and looked at it, "Well, it seems you aren't that perfect afterall Mrs. I've-got-a- scar-on-my-thigh."

Rhea raised an eyebrow and retorted, "Did the sex knock a few IQ points off?"

Adam giggled and stroked her scar gently, "Imperfections are good, they make you human. Even though you don't fuck like one."

"Nice comeback but that adolescent moment is not going away anytime soon." She looked at the watch on the bedside table and observed the time. Three more hours until dawn.

"I guess you're not the type to stick around for breakfast the morning after?"

Rhea looked back and replied evenly, "No, I'm not, but I will stick around to ask you for a favor." The smile that came was laden with mischief.

"I do charge for favors actually." He grinned. 

She slid down the bed and licked over his belly, "I know you do, and you can consider this as the beginning of the payment."

Adam arched as she took his semi-erect shaft into her mouth and began working it until his second orgasm. By dawn, Adam considered Rhea's payment received in full. 

Homecoming:

Rhea sipped her morning detox juice at the breakfast table. Having just finished her morning workout regimen she felt the familiar surge of confidence and control, which was good since she would need both for the day ahead. Her husband arrived late the previous night, and she was eager to meet him this day. 

She observed him stumbling out of his room, covered in his customary dark robe that struggled to stay closed against his enormous belly. His eyes were bloodshot and swollen and his morning manner, as ever, was belligerent, "What the hell are you so happy about?" he growled at her. 

"I have a present for you."

With a snort, he motioned for the butler to bring in his breakfast, "Planning on killing yourself?" he asked with genuine cheer.

Rhea ignored the retort and continued, "I wanted to apologize for my behavior that night. It was very callous and mean of me."

Her husband eyed her suspiciously but did not interrupt her as she continued, "I know things have been rough recently for you, with the medication and all, and I wanted to express that I'm with you on this journey all the way."

He nodded, the suspicion giving way to a glimmer of decency, "And this present..."

"Yes, it's in your study. Come I shall show it to you." 

Rhea led him into his study and displayed the portrait that hung opposite his worktable. It was the portrait which Rhea received along with Adam's invitation.
