 Author's Note: 

I apologize deeply for the long wait. I got promoted (yay me), but now I have a load of responsibilities and a bunch of idiots to reform (boo); so I've been busy, busy, busy with work. 

This chapter was supposed to be one with the one before it, but as I mentioned before, it stretched out and I had to cut it in half. Well, it's still very long, and I had to cut a lot of scenes from it, but didn't want to butcher it more than I already did, so I stopped cutting. 

I feel like I need to start posting the future chapters under the "Novels and Novellas" category since this story (which started out more or less as a dare) got longer, and somehow more personal. I wanted to get some opinions though, let me know. If I don't get any advice, I'll probably go ahead and change the category with the next chapters, so don't leave me hanging! 

Again, thank you for reading, and I look forward to all your feedback!
