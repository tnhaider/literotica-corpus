 'Who is Claire?' Julie asked, as she scrolled through the text messages in the inbox of her husband's phone.

'One of my clients, sweetie,' answered Brian, not taking his eyes off the laptop screen.

'And why the hell is she texting my husband at bedtime?' she probed, tossing the phone towards Brian and watched it land on the bed, next to him.

He looked at the device and frowned, before shooting an angry look towards her. Realizing that any further discussion on this matter would be futile, he went back to his work. Julie winced at his silence and walked up to him.

'I am talking to you, dammit,' she yelled, waiting for him to respond.

'Stop screaming like a fisherman's wife,' he chided. 'You know very well what kind of a guy I am, Jules,' he remarked, squarely. 'The mere fact that we are having this discussion ...'

'You will never understand how much I fear losing you,' she confessed, interrupting him and voicing her insecurities. 'And now, you are saying that I am behaving like a fisherman's wife,' she whispered, tears welling up in her eyes.

'Shut the fuck up, Julie!' muttered Brian, his anger surging. 'You are acting like a bitch who doesn't know when to shut her fucking mouth,' he spat out and climbing out of the bed, walked out of the bedroom along with his laptop and phone.
