 She had only been working there for a few months. The man that had hired her seemed to think it was good for business having a fresh young thing behind the counter, the guys that came in to shoot their games felt the same. There were always comments floating around the room "Fresh meat on the hoof," " Wouldn't mind a piece of that beaver pup!" The boys seemed to enjoy egging each other on to try and get her attention, asking her out for a coffee after work, buying the porn books from the owner and asking her if she' ld teach them to read. Little did they know that she wasn't a so fresh, she had taken care of that little matter in the spring just after she had moved here. Since then she' d been staying with a short stocky biker; he worked the mines like the rest of the men in the northern mining town. 

 There was one guy that had caught her eye, he wasn't really good looking, tall and gangly with a slightly pock marked face, like he'd had acne as a kid.  There was something about him that had attracted her to him the first time he' d walked down the outdoor flight of stairs and into the dimly lit hall. Then she had seen him on his Harley and that had really impressed her, it was a deep blue; not quite navy blue, it gleamed too much to be navy, more a royal blue. The sun had caught on one of the chrome mufflers reflecting into her eyes making her shield them for a second or two. He sat so straight on the seat, his long legs well out on the forks. The wind whipping his hair around his head, the colours he wore so proudly and the confidence with which he rode was a definite turn on. He had flirted with her too, only not so openly as the others, a smile here and there, an extra tip when he paid for his table time. His voice was deep and husky, too many years of smoking those skinny cigars he seemed to always have hanging out of his mouth.

That particular afternoon he came in just as the shift change was about to happen. She  was always off at 5, the owner knew it was better to have the older cashiers on when the boys came in from the bar down the street. Her feet were sore, it was payday and she had been on the run all afternoon, there was always a steady run for coffee and cold pop but paydays she literally ran all shift long. Standing at the cash register counting out her float and balancing her tabs for the day she arched her back reaching for the ceiling to help stretch out the muscles in her back. The mini skirt rode even higher up her thighs revealing to all those behind her the red bikini panties she wore. Wolf whistles erupted and loud cheers burst from the men lining the coffee bar.

Turning to see what had caused the ruckus the tall biker realized the young woman’s gorgeous legs were revealed all the way up to her tight little ass. One of the bolder men was actually reaching across the counter as if to grab a piece of that well formed butt. With two strides of his long legs he was laying a work calloused hand on the man’s shoulder pushing back onto his stool, “I wouldn’t be doing that if I was you Jason, that’s pretty young for  an old fart like you to be messing with!”

“Just who the hell do you think you are telling me who I can mess with CB? Get out of my way you asshole!” the man rose to his feet coming barely to CB’s shoulders. 

“Behave yourself old man or I’ll have to take you outside and teach you some lessons!” with both hands on Jason’s shoulders CB easily shoved him back into his seat once again. 

The girl finally realized what had been happening and with a wide smile thanked CB for his help, “Thanks so much, it’s nice to know that all the men here aren’t pigs, how about letting me pay for your next game in thanks?” She couldn’t believe that this sexy guy was standing up for her, maybe her luck was about to change. “I’m off work in a few minutes, how about showing me how to play the game?”

“Well I’m afraid I can’t today, but how about another time? I have an extra shift tonite and should get home for a rest before I go back. Would you like a ride somewhere?” A smile spread across his face as Amy grabbed her jacket and purse, swung open the gate and came out from behind the counter. 

“Sure if you don’t mind, I was heading over to my sister’s for dinner, it’ll save me the walk and God only knows my feet are killing me.” Looping her arm through his they headed out the doors; looks of astonishment filled the faces of the men left behind.

“Well maybe you won’t get bothered so much now, some of these guys weren’t raised with any manners at all.” They reached street level and there was CB’s bike in all it’s spotless glory parked at the curb. “I know you ride, I’ve seen you out on the road with that chubby guy from the mine, what’s his name Bryce, Bruce or something isn’t it?”

“Bruce actually, he’s just a good friend, I’ve been staying with him since my brother-in-law decided I wasn’t earning my keep while I stayed with them. I moved up here last winter to go to school and help out my sister with her new baby. It didn’t work out though, Butch expected a little more than babysitting and helping with the housework.” Slinging her purse over her shoulder she climbed onto the bike behind CB and wrapped her arms around his waste.  The mini skirt nearly ceased to exist as it climbed even further up her thighs. Her long legs tight against his as they pulled out into the traffic CB felt her heat through his jeans. “I’m not in a big hurry if you want to go for a spin, their place is out Longview Drive.”

The wind in their hair, the fresh air running along beside them, CB gunned the bike and they were off the main drag and heading down a side street. He turned onto the circle drive that went around the city and gave her some gas, with no sissy bar to lean against Amy clung even harder to keep from sliding off the bike. She wasn’t quite sure about this ride now, she was much more used to the slow steady pace Bruce set on his BSA. As they took a wide corner at breakneck speed she felt the strength of the Harley motor pull them around it and out into the straight away again. The throbbing of the motor was vibrating all through her body setting her already excited body on fire. They swung onto Longview Drive and Amy pointed out her sister’s house, CB pulled up in front letting the motor slow to a dull roar. 

“Hey that was great, this baby has a lot of power! Maybe we could go for a longer ride sometime? I don’t work everyday and I hope you don’t always pull double shifts.” Amy slid out from behind CB quickly pulling her skirt to a more respectable location on her long legs.

“Yeh, I’d like that, I’ll catch up to you at the Pool Hall sometime soon but right now I better get out of here and catch a snooze. You take it easy now and I’ll catch you later!” With a wink he gunned the bike laying rubber as he peeled off down the street.




The following Sunday with her shift almost done Amy was cleaning the pool tables, brushing the felt carefully. A shadow fell across the table and looking up she saw CB standing between her and the next table. “So what do you think little lady, want to go for that ride today? I thought maybe we could head out to the lake and have a swim if you like.”

“Well hi there, that sounds like a great idea, I always love to swim in this hot weather, that lake isn’t very big and sure gets nice and warm not like our lakes back home, they’d give you goose bumps all year long. Give me five minutes and I’ll be finished up here, okay?” Taking the brush and mini vac with her she headed for the storeroom, CB watching the sway of her hips in her tight red shorts. 



A half hour later they were headed out a back road, a small backpack over Amy’s shoulders held a picnic of Kentucky Fried and all the fixings. A quick stop at the Beer Store had added an icy sixpack of brews to the pack. Even though the temperature was in the high eighties the wind as they rode felt cool on her bare legs and arms.  They turned onto a little side road and wound their way down to a beautiful little creek that had formed a natural pool at the end of the road.

“This is beautiful, how did you ever find it? I thought you guys all liked to be out in the limelight when you’re on your bikes!” Amy was amazed at the clear water, the banks lined with berry bushes, some still in blossom.  

“Hey everybody likes a little quiet time now and then. I come out here once in a while to fish, it’s good for the mind and the body! So what do you think, food or water?”

Amy was already removing the tight shorts as he turned to look at her after making sure the bike’s kick stand wouldn’t sink into the soft ground. As he watched her peel off her shorts he couldn’t help but feel a reaction, she wore only the tiniest bikini under them! As she pulled her T-shirt over her head revealing miniature triangles of cloth that barely covered her nipples he had to swallow hard before speaking, “That’s some swimsuit Amy, you sure it’s water proof? It’s so small it may just disappear when the water hits it!”

“Now is that wishful thinking or what? Come on, I’ll race you across to the other side!” Running for the water she dove headlong into the pool surfacing far out in the crystal clear water. She watched as CB tried to quickly remove his boots only managing to lose his balance and end up sitting on the grass in a tangle of arms and legs. “Having problems there? Can I offer some help?”

Laughing CB finally managed to remove his boots and jeans, the long legs carried him quickly to the water’s edge and in deep enough to swim out to where Amy was treading water. Reaching for her he slipped an arm around her small waste and pulled her close. Kissing her the length of her neck and then across her jaw, he wasn’t surprised to find her mouth open waiting for his tongue. He ran his hands slowly down her body feeling each curve as he went. Her firm butt filled his hands as he lifted her up out of the water so he could kiss her small breasts. Using his teeth he pulled the scrap of fabric from one nipple and sucked it, teasing it with his teeth and tongue as it grew hard in his mouth. 

Her arms wrapped around his neck Amy held onto CB as he explored her body, the touch of his hands and mouth bringing warm sensations to her now cooled skin. He was so tall, he was standing on the bottom of the pool while she floated against him. She felt his long fingers kneading her butt, gently squeezing their firmness in his hands. As he slid his fingers under the strings along her hips and began to pull down she deftly swam away from him. Laughing at him she swam to the edge of the pond glancing back to see him paddling after her.  Reaching the grassy area along the shore she stretched out in the sun holding her arms open to him as he came towards her. 

Towering over her CB couldn’t believe how beautiful she looked, the drops of water catching the sunlight as it hit her body. Her wet hair spread out around her head on the grass, the tiny bikini barely hiding her nipples and pubic hair. The cool water had held his erection in check but now out in the warm sun, looking down on her, his boxer shorts were becoming snug around his rising manhood. Lying down beside her he ran a finger from her chin down between her breasts and under the fabric hiding her womanhood from him. Even though the material was cool his finger soon became warmed by the moistness he found between her legs. Kneeling beside her he quickly removed the bikini bottom and spread her legs to look at her. The blond curls there were moist with passion and her lips were pink and glistening with her wetness. Bending towards her he let his tongue explore the pink folds, tasting the sweetness there. His tongue quickly moving back and forth over her clit he heard a moan escape her lips. One of his long fingers slipped into her pussy as she raised her hips offering herself to him. Slowly he twisted his finger as he ran it in and out of her wetness all the while licking at her, wanting to feel her cum. 

Amy couldn’t believe how he was making her feel, no man had ever taken the time to touch her without her having to encourage him first. Lying there she felt her blood begin to boil as he brought her closer and closer to orgasm. His tongue moving back and forth, his finger in and out, her hips moving in rhythm with him she felt the rush as her muscles contracted around his finger. A low moan escaped her as she pushed her hips into him cumming all over his hand and tongue.

 She needed to feel his cock inside her now! Reaching for him she thought she had touched his thigh. From the groan that CB gave at her touch she knew she must be wrong, this huge thing under her hand was his penis! “My God you’re huge! Let me see you,” she pulled herself away from him and pushed him back so she could have a better look. His shorts were bulging with the size of his erection, she reached forward and ran a finger the length of him amazed at what she saw and felt. Pulling the band of the shorts away from his firm belly she released him from them and couldn’t help but let out a “WOW” as he became fully erect. His penis was at least 10 inches long and the width of a garlic coil, she had never seen anything so large though she had heard about men who were so well endowed. Her fingers reached for him and circled his shaft marvelling at the size and hardness. Bending over him she ran her tongue over the length of him, her mouth opening to take him into her as she reached the tip.

 Realizing what she was doing, CB gently rolled her onto her side placing his face between her legs once again. Licking, kissing, nibbling, their passions rising the lovers stroked and fondled each other. CB could hold back no longer, moving to kneel between her legs he spread her thighs and rubbed his penis along her wet pussy. The wetness there spreading along him as he stroked her with his hardness. Slowly he inserted himself into her, very gently easing into her wet, hot hole. 

“God it’s so big, be careful, please don’t hurt me.” She was scared but wanted to feel him in there, he was so huge she was afraid he would split her wide open. 

“I’ll be careful, let me know when you’ve got enough that’s all. I won’t hurt you I promise.” He was being so gentle, his hand holding the shaft back from her, making sure she didn’t get hurt. Inch by inch he began to push into her, she was so wet that he slid into her smoothly until he felt an obstruction stopping him. 

“Stop CB, that’s it, my God it feels wonderful!” Amy had never experienced this, the hard cock was nearly all in her and she couldn’t accept any more. He was so huge she felt the entire length of his penis. They both watched the slow strokes of his shaft, moving in and out of her. Not wanting to take a chance as he reached orgasm CB pulled out and shot his seed over her belly. 

The puddle of cum so warm on her, Amy reached her fingers into it and spread it over her skin; then licked each one clean. “I think maybe I could use a real swim now, care to join me?” Removing the top of her bikini she went back to the water hand in hand with CB.  They spent the afternoon making love, swimming and eating their picnic. As the sun was setting they rode back into town, both content and yet wanting more, knowing that they would soon return to their pool in the woods.
