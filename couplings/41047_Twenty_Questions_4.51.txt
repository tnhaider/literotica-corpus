 He felt his phone vibrating in his pocket.

He glanced at the caller id, and smiled.

"Hi," he said, answering it.

It was quiet at first.

"Hello?" he said.

"Hi," she whispered.

"Everything ok?" he said.

"Uhm hm," she said.

"Ok," he said.

"Is this a bad time?" she said.

"A bad time for what?" he said, still smiling.

"I was wondering if you might want to play a game," she said.

"A game? I like games," he said.

"I know you do," she said, whispering again.

"What kind of game," he said.

"Twenty...," she started to say, then stopped for a minute.

"You ok?" he said.

"Yeah, I'm ok," she said.

"Twenty questions. That's the game," she said 

He laughed, quietly.

"Ok. Aren't you supposed to tell me if it is animal, vegetable, or mineral?" he asked.

"Not this version," she said, and he heard her breathing through the phone.

"This version is to guess what I'm doing right now," she said, in a whisper.

He smiled differently now. 

"Ah....I see. Well, interesting twist," he said.

"Isn't it?" she said.

"Ok, let's see," he said, thinking.

"We'll count backwards from 20. How about that?" he said.

"Good, yes," she whispered again.

"Here's your first question. #20. You are breathing awfully heavy. Are you having an asthma attack?" he said.

She giggled softly.

"Nope," she said. 

"#19 — are you at home?" he said.

"Oh yeah," she whispered.

"Here's #18 — are you doing something that could be considered work?" he said.

"I'm....," her voice hitched a little.

"I'm working hard, yes," she whispered.

"#17 — is it something you enjoy?" he asked, smiling.

"Ohhhhhh yeah," she said, in almost a sigh.

"Are you in your bedroom? #16" he asked.

"Yes....," she said.

"#15 — is it something that makes you hot?" he said.

She didn't answer for a second.

"Hello?" he said, smiling to himself.

"Yes...yes, it makes me very hot," she said.

"I've got it!" he said.

"What...?" she said.

"You're running on a treadmill!" he said, laughing to himself.

She laughed out loud.

"Fuck you! I don't have a treadmill and you know it," she said.

"Oh yeah. I forgot," he said.

"Are you wearing pants?" he said, with #14.

"Nope," she whispered.

"#13...a skirt?" he asked.

"Nuh uh," she whispered.

"#12 ...a lampshade?" he asked.

She laughed softly.

"I'll save you your questions...I'm not ....not wearing anything," she whispered, her breathing getting more ragged.

He felt himself responding. His body reacting.

"So, with #11, I'm wondering if what you're doing is making you wet," he asked.

"Oh god," she whispered.

"Fuck yeah," she said.

"You must be taking a shower?" he said, laughing.

"Yes, with my cell phone in hand," she whispered. 

He laughed.

"Wise guy. Take your time. The longer you take to guess...," she whispered.

"What?" he said.

"The better it is for me," she whispered.

"Is that so? So it must be something that is better with time," he said.

"Are you corking your own wine vintage? - #10" he said.

She laughed out loud.

"No, I am not," she said.

Her breathing was getting faster.

"This sounds awfully familiar. Is this something you've done with me? #9" he asked.

He could hear soft sighs coming from the phone.

"Oh ....oh yeah," she said.

"Many, many times," she said.

"I thought so," he said.

"So you're working hard, it makes you hot, it gets you wet, and it is something you've done with me..." he said.

She gasped softly.

"That's right," she whispered.

"#8 - You're playing tennis?" he asked.

"I can't laugh anymore....but if I could, I'd be laughing," she said, her breathing faster. 

"Oh, that's right. You don't play tennis," he said.

"Washing dishes? #7," he said.

No answer...just sighing, breathing.

"No, huh. Boy, am I bad at this game," he said.

Still, he could hear her breathing faster.

His voice lowered.

"Maybe it is just too fucking hard for me," he said.

Her heavy breathing turned to gasping.

"Don't," she whispered.

"What? I mean, it is obviously...really fucking hard," he said.

Her breathing was coming faster.

"It is so fucking hard...for me to come...up with what you're doing," he whispered, smiling.

She moaned softly.

"Waiiittt a minute!" he said, with an over-dramatic tone of realization.

"I think I've finally figured it out!' he said.

"Ohhhh yeah?" she whispered.

"#6....are you thinking about me?" he said.

"Oh yeah," she said, quickly.

"#5... thinking about me kissing you?" he whispered.

"No...," she said.

"#4....thinking about me touching you?" he whispered.

"Maybe...," she whispered.

"#3....are you being a bad girl, touching yourself where I would?" he whispered.

"Oh.....fuck....yeah," she whispered, her gasps turning to moans.

"#2....are you going to come?" he whispered.

Her breathing was raspy screams now, whispering, mumbling.

"Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah," she whispered.

"Wait! Don't do it yet," he whispered.

"I c...c....can't," she whispered.

"Yes, yes you can. One more question," he said.

"Hurry!" she begged him.

"It isn't a yes or no question," he said.

"Whatever.....fuck, Just hurry...hurry please," she said.

His voice came from behind her.

"#1....Can you guess where I am right now?' he said.

The sound of the two cell phones hitting the floor, simultaneously, was not quite the loudest noise in her room that day. 

But it was close.
