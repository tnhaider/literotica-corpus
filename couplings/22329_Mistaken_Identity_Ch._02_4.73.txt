 In "Mistaken Identity", Debbie, a college Sophomore, was at a hotel early one evening to meet her married lover at the time they had routinely met for several months for a few hours of sex. Always in need of money, she had met him as a baby sitter, arranged through the college. He had introduced her to oral sex, both ways, but recently began trying to end their meetings in order not to jeopardize his marriage. Much to Debbie's sexual frustration, he apparently had chosen this day not to show up. An older man then addressed her by name and guided her into the restaurant. He asked questions and led her through interesting conversations and before she could question what had happened they had finished dinner and danced several numbers and she began to realize that she would not have to forego her desired rendezvous with an erect cock. 

The result was that she had the best sexual experience of her young life that night with the man, Warren, who was old enough to be her father. The next morning, as she left his room, he handed her an envelope full of money, more than she ordinarily earned in a month of working several part time jobs. He explained it included a large tip because she was the best he'd ever been with, as if she wanted to be with him and had enjoyed it. He had assumed she was the call girl he had arranged for. While starting to explain the error but letting him know that she had, indeed, enjoyed it, Debbie was captivated by the money and instead asked for the telephone number that Warren used to arrange for a girl.
