 I don't think that this is really a poem. I first wrote it in paragraph format, and then after re-reading this story, I decided to break it up, into a scrolling pattern, as in an IM conversation. I think it works best if you read it very slowly, allowing time for each single line to sink in. I hope you enjoy it.



* * * * *

I return home from a long business trip

to a house lit with candles

and you greet me at the door 

with a glass of wine,

wearing nothing but a towel

and a smile.



Leaving my luggage at the door,

you take me by the hand

and lead me through the house

into our room,

where the fire is lit

the curtains are drawn

and the bed is turned down.



You have yet to kiss me,

but I see the hunger in your eyes

echoed in mine

and I stand still as you touch my face.



You slowly undress me,

there in front of the fire

so that I can feel the heat on my skin

as each layer falls away,

until I am naked before you.

You touch my lips with your own,

pressing against me

letting your towel fall away

until I can fell the full length of you,

skin to skin.



You then lead me into the bathroom

where you have drawn a hot, steaming bath

piled high with bubbles.

Together, we slip into the warm waters,

you leaning against the back,

me sitting in front of you,

your arms around me,

you mouth caressing my neck.



I relax against you,

lulled by the wine and the heat,

yielding myself to the comforting sensation

of simply being with you.



For a while, 

we are content just to lie still, and to be,

but eventually your hands start to move,

stroking over my abdomen,

rising to my breastsm

drawing lazy circles in the bubbles over my breasts.



Your hands feel like fire - hotter than the water,

and I feel myself quickening at your touch.

I squirm to get further back against you,

feeling you slippery behind my back.

I moan as your tongue finds my ear,

tracing its outline,

while your fingers skillfully draw out my nipples.



When you hand dips lower,

between my legs, I gasp.

It has been so long

that I'm afraid that I'll cum

with just one stroke of your hand.



I whimper as your fingers slide across me,

teasing my lips, 

circling my clit,

bringing it to full attention.



My hips buck to meet your hand

as you dip first one finger,

then two, 

deep inside of me;

curling up and rubbing and twisting.



"Let go" you whisper,

and so I do, 

surrendering myself to you,

to the feeling of one hand playing with my breasts,

you kisses on my neck and shoulders,

and your fingers moving inside of me

until I cannot stop myself.

I feel my vagina clamping down on your fingers

and my clit slamming against your hand

as my orgasm overtakes me.

 As I catch my breath,

I lay back, content, against you;

the warm water and bubbles lapping at my breasts,

your hardness pressed against my back.



The oils that you have added to the bath

have made us both very slippery;

a good thing that the bottom of the tub is textured to keep us from slipping! 

Our skin is shiny and slick, 

The water forming droplets that glisten

in the reflected light of the many candles around the room.



The heat from the fire in the neighboring bedroom, 

the candles and the steam from the bath

has made the bathroom comfortably warm,

so you don't feel a chill when I tell you to rise 

and sit on the edge of the tub.

Your arms support you on either side,

feet still dangling in the water.



I turn to face you, kneeling in the water,

your feet rubbing along my sides, 

hooking behind my back, drawing me closer.



I take your right foot in my hands, and 

feel your toes, slippery between my fingers,

tickling them lightly,

kissing them tenderly,

as my hands move over your sole, 

up your ankle, 

massaging your calf, to your knee. 



I repeat this with your left foot,  

this time nibbling on your toes,

drawing one and then another into my mouth. 

I massage your left calf, then your shin, 

trailing my hands up to your knee.



Pushing your knees farther apart, 

my hands continue their journey,

up your slippery thighs,

darting beneath your legs, 

moving back on top,

inching my way upward, 

exploring the muscles of your thighs, 

my kisses trailing behind the path left by my hands. 



Adding a bit more oil to my hands, 

I reach the parting of your thighs, 

and feel the heaviness of your scrotum in my hands;

a pleasant weight, 

warm, full of life, sliding in my palms.

I can't resist kissing one testicle, and then the other, 

using my tongue to probe and separate, 

to slide in between their roundness.



My exploration is interrupted, though, 

by the thumping of your shaft on top of my head.

I laugh at seeing you eager, 

your member hard and erect, 

rubbing in the part of my hair. 



Grinning up at you, I shift back a bit, 

so that I can grab the base of your cock with my hand, 

feeling it jump at my touch.

Mmm...warm, and hard, and slippery, 

your heartbeat pulsing through it. 



Holding you still, I take a minute to 

just to look at you,

my eyes moving from your face back down to your member,

seeing the way the veins trace patterns along the shaft,

seeing the head, dark and shiny,

noticing the ridges where the head joins your shaft,

and those delicious drops of precum oozing out of the very tip. 



With my other hand, 

I touch a finger to your very tip, 

smoothing your juices over your head, 

mixing it the with the oils, 

making you even shinier. 



And then I can resist no more, 

so with a smile, 

I lower my head, 

inhaling the scent of you, 

before using your cock to trace along my lips, 

parting them, 

letting my tongue come out to taste you,

warm, salty-sweet.



I savor the smoothness of your tip,

rolling my tongue up and over and around, 

not sure if I'm rubbing my tongue on you, 

or you on my tongue, or does it matter? 



I feel the slit and try to dip my tongue in, 

seeking more of your juices, 

suckling a bit to draw them out.



I take your full head into my mouth, 

wrapping it with my tongue and lips, 

feeling you pressed up against the roof of my mouth

and just hold you there for a minute, 

trying to memorize the feeling. 



Meanwhile, my free hand has reverted to its exploration of your legs, 

drawing lazy lines up the insides of your thighs, 

playing with your balls, 

ducking underneath them to feel the silky smoothness

that disappears between your buttocks,

lightly stroking back over your anus,

feeling you shudder as I press lightly there,

then moving back up top to curl my fingers in the pubic hair around your base.



Wanting to draw you deeper now, I bend forward

sliding down your shaft,

inch by inch,

my tongue exploring your sides as a I go,

until I have you as deep as I can manage.

I wrap my lips tightly around you,

savoring the fullness and the warmth of you in my mouth,

rotating my head this way and that

so that different parts of you connect with my tongue,

finding your pulse.



I feel one of your hands move to my hair,

your fingers running through it, knotting it in your hands.

I hear your breath getting rapid

and a small groan escaping your lips,

and it arouses me even more to know 

the effect that I'm having on you;

knowing that you want to thrust yourself 

in and out of my mouth,

but that you are holding back,

waiting for my lead.



I begin to move my mouth, 

slowly at first,

up and down your shaft,

followed by the hand that is still gripping

the base of your cock.

I swirl my tongue over your head

every time I get close to the end of you,

then suck you back in

deep into my throat.



Your cock is jerking in my hands now,

and your scrotum is getting tight

and this spurs me on, 

to stroke you faster.

Now my spare hand ducks

between my own legs,

feeling my own arousal;

my lips puffy, and slick with bath oil,

my clit engorged with anticipation.



I'm not sure whose sounds are whose,

as I'm making small noises of need

that are echoed by yours.

When I started this, I thought that I was going

to be satisfied with pleasing you,

and perhaps touching myself.

But now I know that I need more,

that I need you deep inside of me.



And so I rise from the tub,

using you for balance

and draw you up with me.

Dripping moisture on the floor,

I press against you;

our hot, slippery bodies meeting full on,

my breasts smashed against you,

your cock trapped between us,

my mouth desperately seeking yours,

needing that connection.



I feely you hard against me,

your arms wrapped around me

making us merge into one.

Our bodies slide against each other,

and this only increases my need to a more frantic pitch.



I drag you across the room to the counter

with it's mirror behind.

Bending at the waist, supporting myself on the counter,

I pull you behind me,

wanting to watch both of our faces in the mirror

as you enter me from behind.

My hand guides you and

I gasp as I feel your cock part my lips,

first sliding up and over my clit,

before backing up, and finding my entrance.



I want you NOW!

Not willing to wait,

I push back against you, hard,

taking all of you into me with one thrust.

A loud noise comes from somewhere deep inside of me 

as I feel you bottom out in my pussy.



Smiling at you in the mirror,

I look at your hands on my hips,

your height behind me,

our joining below the waist,

my breasts hanging down;

we make a such beautiful sight.



I keep still for a moment, 

just feeling you throbbing and pulsing inside of me,

waiting for you to make the next move.

I shiver as you wrap your arms around me,

pulling me tighter, closer.



I watch your hands fondle my breasts as

you begin to move inside of me.

Your hands first cup them, 

feeling their full weight,

as our eyes lock in the mirror.

I feel your fingers find my nipples,

drawing them out with your touch,

flicking over them with the tips of your fingers.



Still caught in the reflection of your eyes,

I feel you slide partway out,

then back in,

testing our fit, like a couple of puzzle pieces,

wiggling to see how deep you can go.



I grind my hips against you in circular motions,

wanting to feel your penis touch every part inside of me.

I contract the muscles in my vagina as hard as I can,

trying to embrace your cock with myself.



Already I feel myself building towards climax.

It isn't going to take me long.

And as you start to pick up speed,

I can no longer look at you in the mirror.

My eyes closed, 

I surrender myself to the sensations.



Our breath is getting irregular.

I am bucking back against you,

meeting each thrust with one of my own,

urging you to go faster...

harder...

longer...

deeper...

feeling the weight of your scrotum knocking against me,

adding to the overall sensations that I'm feeling.

We are almost a blur of motion, moving together.



I'm totally lost in the moment, lost in you.

I sense you beginning to swell inside me

and I contract against you,

pulling you in.

And I shudder when your hand reaches around

and finds my clit,

and you slide our juices over its hardness,

pushing me over the edge

at the same moment that I feel you

begin to spill inside me,

my contractions meeting your pulses.

tears coming down my face,

as the feelings overwhelm me -

a mixed sense of euphoria 

and peace

and wholeness.



And when I am able to open my eyes again,

I find yours in the mirror

and grin at the sweaty sight of us,

still joined together,

your arms wrapped around me

and content smiles on our faces.



It's a good thing

that the water is still in the tub

because we've made quite a mess

and will have to have some fun

getting clean all over again.

But that, as they say

is another story.
