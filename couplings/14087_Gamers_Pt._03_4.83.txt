 I felt a bit awkward, on my way over to the girls' apartment. It had occurred to me that I would be in a room full of women who all knew that Kasia had used me as a sex toy. Technically, I wasn't a cuckold, but the distinction wasn't that great. On the other hand, Trisha and Jazz had known all of it, but had still chosen to invite me over. Maybe I was the only one who saw it as odd. 

Trisha, Angie and Vee were already there; Jazz and Lucy arrived shortly after I did. They were all acting very naturally, so that I began to feel more comfortable. We talked about school a bit, essays and upcoming exams - until Jazz got bored.

- "What are we playing?" she wanted to know.

- "I thought that we could introduce you and Lucy to Castle Algaron, since you missed it, the first time we played it. Then, if you guys want, we could replay Hot Air Racer, since Angie and Trisha missed that one when they were away. The only one who has played both is Vee - if that's alright with her."

- "Fine with me." she said. "They're both fun."

- "It'll also help me figure out who likes what - so that I can choose games that the majority will like."

- "I like killing stuff and kicking these girls' asses." said Jazz.

- "The cooperative ones are fun." said Angie. "Like the castle one. But I don't mind competing, either."

- "Aren't you making a game?" asked Trisha. "From scratch?"

- "Really?" said Jazz, one eyebrow shooting up.

- "That's so cool." said Vee. "Can we try it - when it's finished?"

- "I'm designing it specifically with you guys in mind." I admitted. Well, for Kasia, originally. But I was curious to see if it would work with these girls.

We had a fun night. Jazz didn't complain about the cooperative aspects of Castle Algaron, because she got to 'kill lots of stuff'. In fact, she was pleasantly surprised to discover that being on the same side as the others didn't diminish her enjoyment one bit. Lucy didn't say much during the game - she just peeked at me from underneath all that red hair. But at the end she gave it a smile and a thumbs up.

I had acted as a sort of master of ceremonies through the first game, but in the second, it was every man - or girl - for themselves. That allowed me to observe each girl as she took her turn. 

It was hard not to stare at Jazz. She was so exotic-looking, so unusual. Her unruly, un-brushed black hair, her dark brown eyes and that prominent nose all riveted my attention. She caught me looking once, and simply stared right back. There was a challenge in her eyes, and in her posture and body language. Everything about this girl seemed to shout 'What are you looking at?'. 

Trisha - I had to resist the urge to think of her as Patricia - was a pretty, vivacious girl, trapped in a large girl's body. She also had incredibly large ears. I could only imagine the teasing she must have endured in grade school. Yet she remained kind, and pleasant. She was easily the most attentive and empathetic to other people's needs.

Lucy was just a mystery. She didn't seem shy, or lacking in confidence. She simply didn't say much. Maybe she was unconsciously following her friend Jazz's lead, but Lucy also looked as if she didn't own a hair brush. And I still couldn't get used to her unusual posture: she always seemed to have her chin tucked in, her head tilted forward, so that she looked up at people through a curtain of red hair.

Angie looked different, for some reason. She had her hair braided, instead of in a bun, which made her appear younger. She had big brown eyes, an over-large nose, and rather thick lips - but I had seen all of those features before. Maybe it was the transition from winter wardrobe to spring clothing; she didn't look so much like an elderly librarian. Now I could see the curves of her body, and they were quite impressive. In fact, if I had to guess, I would have said that Angie was stacked.

Vee still looked like the typical girl next door. Her hair was that in-between shade, neither blonde nor brown. It was fairly straight, lacking anything in the way of body, or curl. Her face was cute, but where Kasia made me think of a pixie, or a fairy, Vee reminded me of a hobbit. She had that 'little sister' vibe, and what little I knew of her financial situation (difficult) and her home situation (less than ideal) made me want to protect her.

Vee's wardrobe had also changed with the season. For the first time, I realized that she was not chunky at all. Her waist may not have been narrow, but she wasn't fat, by any means. She had only looked that way, previously, because of the excessively loose and bulky clothing she wore. 

On my way back from the fridge with a beer, Trisha asked me a question about a card she had drawn. I answered her, then stood behind her chair as Angie finished her turn. That's when I realized that, from this position, I was ideally placed to do a little surreptitious cleavage inspection. 

Neither Patricia nor Lucy were showing any. Jazz wasn't shy at all, but she wasn't wearing a push-up bra. In fact, she might not have been wearing a bra at all. Angie only had two buttons on her shirt undone, but even so ... mamma mia. She was stacked. The biggest surprise of all, though, was that I couldn't see Vee's stomach from this angle. She had a sizeable chest which was blocking my view.

I returned to my seat before I got caught perving. But I was quite pleased with my new discoveries. Then I thought of Kasia's pencil eraser nipples, and spoiled my own mood.

Hot Air Racer was a big hit with both Trisha and Angie. They liked the concept and the artwork. Jazz was on her way to victory, but the roommates colluded to bring her down. The eventual winner was a surprise to everyone: it was Vee.

- "Wow." she said. "I usually don't win these kinds of things."

- "Maybe your luck is changing." said Jazz. Just by the way she said it, I got the feeling that there were undercurrents here, things that were common knowledge to some or all of them, but completely unknown to me.

I was in no hurry to leave, since I wasn't walking Kasia home. So I accepted the offer of another beer, and listened to the girls talk. There was a little more buzz about school, but mostly they discussed the games we had just played - exactly as my buddies would have done. I felt right at home.

- "When do we play next?" asked Angie. "Two weeks?"

- "I won't be able to make it." said Vee, quietly.

- "That's too bad." I said.

- "How many players do you need?" asked Trisha.

- "For the game I have in mind, it doesn't matter. But the more players, the better your chances of survival. Five or six would be ideal."

- "I can invite someone else." said Jazz. "If that's OK with everyone else."

- "Who? Sin?" asked Trisha.

- "Did you say 'survival'?" Angie asked me.

- "Yes, I did. In this game, you play as a team, but you are being hunted." I said.

- "Who's hunting us?" asked Trisha. "Or is it 'what'?"

I grinned at her. "Zombies."

****************************** 

The old movie posters in Angie and Trisha's apartment were my first clue. Then, the fact that Jazz and Lucy looked like ex-goths. Jazz had said she wanted to kill stuff. That all added up to zombies. Plus it would be a cooperative game, and most of the girls seemed to enjoy those.

I had heard Trisha say 'Sin'. The new girl's name was, in fact, Cynthia - or 'Cyn', for short. She was considerably taller than the others, at 5'9" or maybe 5'10". She was slender, and reasonably attractive, if somewhat odd. For one thing, she wore her auburn hair long in the back, but shaved the sides of her head. She had on a baseball cap, but also lipstick and lots of eye makeup.

- "So you're Dean?" she said, giving me the once-over. "Cool. I'm Cyn." It was probably just my imagination, but they way she said it made me think of the other spelling. Sin.

Zombiepocalypse is a team game, where the players are stock characters from all of those old 'B' movies: the schoolteacher, the town sheriff, the cheerleader, the janitor. Each one has a special ability. Their town is overrun by zombies, the communication net has disappeared, and everyone else is dead. They must cross the center of town, picking up much-needed weapons, supplies and equipment, and then they must fight their way across the bridge to get out of town. By that point, of course, it will be swarming with zombies.

The first four players whose characters are killed by zombies get to pull another character from the reserve deck. After those are used up, anyone who 'dies' is eliminated. It's another great game for new players, because your teammates can help you out with suggestions and advice. Also, there's a slight advantage for those who have watched zombie movies. That, as it turned out, was everyone except Jazz.

- "You've never watched 'The Walking Dead'?" asked Trisha, incredulous.

- "You've never seen a zombie movie? Not even one?" said Angie, equally shocked.

- "I had better things to do." said Jazz, with a shrug.

- "Knitting sweaters? Or making those little tea cozy things?" asked Cyn.

We started off great. Angie found some medical supplies, and then a shotgun. Trisha found an axe. They gave the shotgun to Cyn, who was playing the farmer, and the axe to Jazz, who was playing the gym teacher. The medical supplies went to me. Yeah, I was playing the school nurse. My character card featured a photo of a vacuous blonde with huge tits, and an apparent shortage of buttons on her nurse's uniform. Did I get razzed about it? A little.

- "Nice tits there, Dean." said Jazz.

- "Mmm." said Cyn, licking her lips. No, she wasn't shy, either.

Then Lucy rolled snake eyes while searching the hardware store, and triggered an avalanche of zombies. From that point on, we were on the run, with Jazz and Cyn fighting a rearguard action as the rest of us tried to find things while scrambling towards the bridge.

At that point we were screwed. Jazz and Cyn couldn't cover our backs and lead the fight across the bridge simultaneously. That was the only option, however, as the girls could figure out for themselves. We all suffered gruesome deaths in a TPW - total party wipe.

- "Rematch!" said Jazz.

The others agreed, although Angie and Lucy wanted to switch their starting characters. So did I, but the rest wouldn't let me.

- "We need a medic. It's a vital role." said Jazz.

- "Exactly. We need the nurse." agreed Trisha.

- "Besides, how often does Dean get to look at his own tits?" added Jazz. She actually smiled at me as she said it, just to make it worse.

The second time around went much better. We found many more useful items, and avoided triggering the zombie onslaught until we were much closer to the bridge. With better weapons, and Jazz and Cyn in the lead, we mowed down a dozen zombies. Only two of us died (I admit that I left the nurse a bit too exposed), but we drew replacement characters and forged ahead. It was as clean a win as I had ever seen in this game.

- "This is so much fun." said Cyn, to me. "I wish I'd discovered it sooner."

- "Welcome to the nerd brigade." said Jazz.

- "This doesn't make us nerds." objected Cyn.

- "Oh, yes it does!" insisted Jazz.

- "Embrace your inner nerd." said Lucy.

- "What are we playing next time?" asked Angie. "Same thing? Or a new one?"

- "Well ..." I hesitated. "If you guys are up for it ..." I smiled at Jazz, who winked back at me. "I was wondering if you want to try a game I designed."

****************************** 

Lucy had to cancel at the last minute, so there were five of them: Angie and Trisha, Jazz, Cyn, and Vee. They were all curious to see what I would unveil. I couldn't tell if they were just being polite, or if it was genuine interest. Hopefully, it was the latter; after all, they had enjoyed all of the other games I had introduced them to.

My graphics, of course, looked like shit, because I have the artistic talent of a blind iguana. The map wasn't bad, thanks to my colour printer, but the player cards were just a female silhouette with numbers printed on them - until I figured out something better. I had to hope that they would like the concept and gameplay.

- "The working title is 'Amazons'." I told them.

- "Good start." said Jazz.

- "I like it already." agreed Trisha.

- "You all play Amazon warriors, and you win by collecting the most Glory points." I had green coloured tokens with laurel wreaths printed on them. "You acquire Glory points by becoming Queen of the Amazons - and by staying Queen. But you can also gain Glory by fulfilling quests, by leading your warband on adventures, or by leading the Amazon army to victory over your enemies."

"You can challenge the current Queen to personal combat, or you can plot against her to dethrone her. Obviously, if one player has too many Glory points, you don't want her to be Queen, so you want to ally against her. But you need your best warriors and generals to lead your armies, because everybody loses Glory if you are defeated, while everybody gains Glory when you win."

- "What are these 'coiny' things?" asked Angie.

- "Coins." I answered. "You can gain coins when you raid enemy lands, and plunder Greek cities, or when you complete a quest. Coins will let you support a band of Amazons loyal to you - the more money you have, the larger your personal following. The Amazon with the largest warband will have the best chance of winning the adventures and quests."

- "What happens if we die? Like in battle, or something?" asked Trisha.

- "Or if I push you off a cliff." muttered Jazz.

- "You get a new player card." I said. "You still have money and followers, but you lose some of the Glory you've accumulated."

- "So we're not playing a single person? Is it more like a political party?" asked Vee.

- "Close enough." I said. "I call them factions. So, if you look at your player card, it tells you how many Glory points you can gain for each action, and which actions you can do in a turn. Any other questions?"

- "Maybe we should just start playing, and figure it out as we go." suggested Cyn.

- "That's a good idea." I agreed.

The game was pretty complicated, compared to what they had played before. There was more than one way to win, with many options each turn. Jazz immediately set out on adventures and raids, trying to make her Amazon the deadliest fighter. She made some very lucky dice rolls early on.

- "Total bullshit!" said Cyn. "You should be dead. The odds were against you there."

- "Fortune favors the bold." retorted Jazz. "And the bold will be coming for you first, O Negative One."

Trisha shied away from risking her leader, but tried to accumulate coins by taking on the less dangerous raids and adventures. Angie followed a similar strategy. Cyn was quite bold, though, taking the riskier adventures. In her case, the dice were not nearly so favourable.

- "Aw, fuck." she said, looking at a roll of 3, on two dice. "That can't be good." 

- "You have to roll again, Cyn." I told her. "If you roll a 6 or less, you're dead, but a 7 or better means you're only wounded ..."

She rolled again.

- "FUUUUCK!"

Jazz laughed aloud. "Serves you right."

- "That does it!" said Cyn. She turned to me. "I get a new character, right?"

- "That's right."

- "Good. Then I'm gonna train up my new bitch, and then I'm comin' for you, Jazz. You are going down."

- "Bring it, dead girl." said Jazz.

Yeah, they were a little bit competitive. Meanwhile, Vee was circling the table, with a camera in her hand. She was taking pictures of the players. Jazz struck a pose, one arm held aloft, the other thrust forward.

- "Wow, Jazz." said Trisha. "Do you know what that is?"

- "What?"

- "That pose." said Trisha. "It's called the Warrior's pose, in yoga."

- "Yoga?" said Cyn.

Trish just blushed. "I'm trying to lose weight."

- "The Warrior's pose." mused Jazz. "Yeah, that fits." For the rest of the evening, she would suddenly strike that pose, and dare the rest of us to admire her form. "I look good, right? This is rocking your world, right, Dean?"

Vee also had a question for me.

- "Dean - do you mind if I take pictures of the cards, and the map?"

- "Sure, Vee." I said. "Whatever you like."

Jazz was first to challenge for the title of Queen - which she won.

- "Oh yeah." she growled, flexing her muscles. "The stars are aligned. New Queen, here."

- "Not for long." mumbled Cyn.

She started conspiring with Angie and Trisha to bring Jazz back down to earth. Then Trisha drew the Trojan War card. The Amazons were honor-bound to send an army to aid King Priam against the Greeks. Jazz took up the challenge. Cyn didn't want to do anything that would help Queen Jazz, but Trisha worked on her.

- "Cyn, come on: it's the Trojan War. How can we not go?"

- "If we don't go, we lose Glory." added Angie.

Vee was surprisingly lukewarm about helping them. I would have thought that she'd be into the idea, but then I saw the way she was cradling one of her event cards. Aha, I thought - something's up there.

A united Amazon army went to the aid of Hector and Priam.

- "Can we kill that dick Paris?" asked Jazz.

- "He's on our side." Trisha said.

- "So?"

Outside the walls of beleaguered Troy, Queen Jazz fought the Greek hero Ajax - and rolled an 11 on two dice.

- "What? What? Did you see that?" Jazz struck another warrior pose. "Oh yeah - I killed him, right? Tell me I killed freakin' Ajax."

- "You killed him." I said, with a grin.

- "Can I cut his head off, and tie it to my saddle?"

- "Eew." said Trisha.

There were Glory points for all, and all the loot they could carry. On her next turn, Vee played the card she'd been hoarding. It was a quest: to prevent Jason and the Argonauts from stealing the Golden Fleece. With the spoils of their victory in Troy, she was able to recruit a sizeable warband, and lay an ambush for the Argonauts.

- "Holy shit, girl!" said Jazz. "Did you just kill Jason?"

- "And look at Hercules run!" laughed Cyn.

A turn later, the roommates engineered a plot to overthrow Queen Jazz, and replace her with the player who had the lowest Glory score: Cyn.

- "You evil bitches! Can I kill them?" asked the Queen.

- "You've been exiled." I told her. "You'll have to plan your comeback."

- "How do I do that?"

- "You need the support of at least two of the other players." I said.

- "Which is not happening." said Cyn, rubbing it in.

She spoke too soon. Within a few turns, Cyn had failed to repay her allies for their support, and the natives were growing restless. Angie and Trisha tried to persuade Vee to join with them, but Vee wasn't interested. Maybe it was loyalty, or maybe she knew that she was in 2nd place, behind Jazz.

It was fun to watch Jazz signalling Angie and Trisha. The three conspirators met behind the fridge, and worked out the details of a second coup.

- "They're ganging up on me, aren't they?" asked Cyn.

- "Looks that way." I had to agree. The trio returned to the table, with innocent faces that fooled no one. On Jazz's turn, they struck. Ex-Queen Jazz was recalled from exile, and Queen Cyn was driven out. Angie, who was trailing in points, ascended the throne.

- "Queen Angie." she said. "I like the sound of that."

- "Enjoy it while it lasts, you back-stabber." said Cyn.

- "Ooh, a little bitter, are we?" got in Jazz.

Two turns later, Jazz made her move, and challenged Queen Angie to single combat.

- "What?" said Angie. "We're on the same side!"

- "Ancient History, sweetheart." said Jazz, which I found hysterically funny.

As stepping down would have cost her too many Glory, Angie decided to fight, even though the odds were against her.

- "Queen Jazz is back, bitches!" roared the victor, striking her warrior pose yet again.
