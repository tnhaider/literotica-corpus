  Prologue The Only One And the Divine Spirit didst say thusly, unto the wise men,  concerning a young man and woman. "And shall a young man take his young woman into his newly built house, And shall both find carnal delight as he sows his seed in her bounty. And shall his be the plow with which he tills her fertile soil. And shall his plow be the instrument of her pleasure. And shall her fertile soil be the instrument of his." Thus did the Divine spirit say unto the wise men, and they did see that it was good and true. Peace be with you, young man. A blessing on thy house. The book of the Divine Spirit, Verse CCX, line 14.  - -
