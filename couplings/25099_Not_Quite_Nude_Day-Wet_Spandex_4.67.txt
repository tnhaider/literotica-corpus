 This is an entry in the Nude Day content for 2016. 

Warning: this story contains no actual nudity, copulation, or prose description, but may contain graphic representations of wet spandex and a variety of oral, labial and lingual explorations. 

The story is all dialogue: all description of the action is in what the characters (one male, one female, alternating their speech) say. There is sexual content that stops short of 'all the way'. In other words, a lot of teasing and foreplay. Consider this an overheard conversation, or a transcribed recording of a first, intimate meeting. All characters are fictional and well over eighteen fictional years have passed since their fictional births. Enjoy.

"Hi. Aren't you friends with Mickey?"

"I...may be. Do I know you?"

"No, not yet. I mean. You're Char's cousin, right? Laverne?"

"This is getting a creepy. Who are you?"

"Sorry. I heard the bartender call you Laverne. There aren't many around."

"Tell me about it. Wait. Never mind, don't. Tell me instead, in as few words as possible, how you know who I am. You're freaking me a little bit out."

"Am I? Try this. I see all, past present and future, when I gaze into my crystal ball...s."

"Okay. That's it. Thanks for the nightmares. I'm outa here."

"I see more. You are soon...going on journey."

"Obviously. Excuse me."

" A journey of great...exposure. You fear to show too much, too soon. You have..."

"Wait. What the hell did you say? Who are you? No bullshit."

"Sorry. Once I get going..."

"Don't then. Do not get going. Short sentences, no backstory. I'm tired and cranky and you aren't helping. Please. Who, what, how."

"Okay. First, to introduce myself, I'm Marco."

"That doesn't answer my...oh shit. Yes it does. You idiot!"

"Ow. I think your little fist just bruised my chest."

"Ow. I think your chest just broke my fist. Now Marco, why didn't you start your story that way last time, instead of going for the stalker-psychic theme? All you had to say was three words. That's all you had to say. Hi, I'm Marco. But no. Crystal balls?"

"I was ad libbing. 'Hi I'm Marco' sounds a little weak in case you didn't recognize the name."

"Not recognize the name of the total stranger who I'm supposed to have a blind date with at a freakin' Nude Day festival. Marco. That's all I know. Do you know how many times in the last week I've said 'Hi Marco, nice to meet you' and wondered what part of you I'm supposed to shake? Okay, now I sound like the creepy one."

"A little bit. Ow."

"You have a really solid chest, Marco. Remind me to not have to hit you anymore."

"I'll try. I know what you mean though: first one to mention Nude Day touching sounds like a creep."

"Pretty much."

"Creep."

"Hey! Stalker."

"Fair enough. Now that your not abandoning your drink here, Laverne, to flee from a psycho stalker, how would you feel about finishing it with me? I'd kind of like to use the opportunity to get to know you in clothes, maybe make tomorrow a little less awkward. It might even turn the tables on Char and Mickey."

"Now you're talking. Anything to pull one over on those two. If we can chat away like old chums tomorrow, easy as can be, it would blow their meddling little minds."

"So, really, all they told you was my name?"

"Pretty much. And you were a swimmer."

"Water polo, mostly. But I swam on teams when I was younger."

"Char said you looked good in a speedo."

"Good to know."

"Cad."

"Absolutely. You know, I've been wondering something. Some people have rules - like no kissing on a first date. I have deduced that you do not have a rule against complete nudity on a first date."

"I deduce the same about you."

"But are there any other dating rules I should know a about?"

"I do have a rule, as a matter of fact. I never go too far until at least the third date."

"Interesting. How far is too far?"

"Pretty far. I won't say 'all the way', because you're never quite all the way there, are you? You can always go further, take it another step, go in different direction."

"I never thought of it that way, and I like the attitude. I wonder how many sad souls quit their sexual exploration once they hit the big All The Way, thinking that's all there is."

"Poor souls, indeed. Hey, wait! Sexual? Who said anything about sex?"

"You strongly implied it. And you have my mind whirling with all the possibilities that might be deemed 'too far'."

"Kind of an open door, huh?"

"Intriguing. The kind of knowledge that makes me interested in a second date."

"And a third, I'm thinking you're thinking."

"Well, of course. All those possibilities, and doors opening. So, are you just in town for the weekend?"

"Trying to figure when a third date might be? No. I got here Wednesday. My parents are starting to need more hand-holding, making sure bills are all paid and stuff. To answer the question I think you're really asking: l leave Sunday afternoon, so only one day after our first date."

"Me too. On the leaving Sunday part."

"And you're staying at this hotel?"

"Would I be at this bar otherwise? You're parents live in town?"

"I was born and raised here."

"Looks like I'll be a local soon enough."

"Whatcha mean?"

"I was offered a raise to take a position at the new plant we're opening here. They need my decision by next week. And Mickey's been bugging me to move here for years. Hmm. We're both leaving Sunday. With our debut blind date tomorrow, that only leave time for two dates. Bummer."

"I know. Now that you stopped stalking me, you're pretty cute. I'm not sure if that makes it any easier to show up Full Monty tomorrow. I didn't really care before, but now I want you to like what you see."

"From what I can tell through the jeans and blouse, you have nothing to worry about."

"Thanks, but you know what I mean. Tell me you're not nervous about that first unveiling."

"I'd be lying if I did. I've paraded around in a wet speedo more times than I can remember, but there is something about being full-on naked that is different. Especially in broad daylight. On a first date."

"Nude. At least a speedo is a halfway step - not clothes, and not nude. Something to ease the transition."

"Hey, do you have swimsuit with you?"

"I do."

"We could play a little 'I'll show you mine if you show me yours.' Just to break the ice and make tomorrow easier."

"Show what?"

"Each other in swimsuits, as a transition to make tomorrow more comfortable."

"And where would we do this? The pool is closed."

"I've got a sunken spa in my room."

"Of course you do. You're Marco."

"It was the only room they had. My employer's paying for it."

"Convenient."

"And we'd just hang out in swimwear? No hanky-panky?"

"Suits stay on. Check. No nudity until tomorrow. Check. Hanky-panky's a little vague."

"Can I trust you?"

"Would Char kill me otherwise?"

"She would. Slowly. With dull power tools. Okay. If you're going to see me nude tomorrow, no harm in showing you how hot I look in a suit tonight. Walk me to my room so I can grab it. Is it alright if I change in your bathroom?"

"I'd be honored."

"Oh. A gentleman: offering me your arm even."

"You know, I just had an idea."

"Another one? This is already pushing some limits."

"I was thinking we could do what we planned, get comfortable being around each other in just our swimsuits, hangout in the spa, but call it a first date."

"So tomorrow is really our second date..."

"And if all goes well with the first two..."

"You'd get your third one on Sunday."

"We both would."

"You are truly devious, sir."

"Why thank you."

"And I like it."

-----

"Wow. Just wow."

"You like?"

"I like. You have no idea how much I like."

"Well, do tell me. Oo. It's hot."

"That is an understatement. 'Hot' doesn't begin to do justice to that suit and how you look in it."

"I meant the water, silly."

"You'll get used to it, it took me a minute or so."

"I noticed you're already hiding most of you underwater. I gotta say your fist-brutalizing chest looks quite nice. Nude Day-worthy. But please go on, sir. You mentioned how hot I look."

"I will. But first tell me where you got that amazing swimsuit."

"This old thing? I wore this in high school; I was a diver on the team for two years. It was the only suit I could find when Char said to bring one."

"She didn't say anything else?"

"About what?"

"About swimsuits?"

"No. Why would she?"

"Um. I have a thing about swimwear; it goes back to co-Ed swim teams while going through puberty, I think. I really like the way an athletic body looks in a racing suit."

"Is that why your eyes have covered every inch of me at least five times in the past 30 seconds?"

"Oh god. Is it that obvious?"

"It is that obvious. But don't be sorry. Notice I'm taking my time getting submerged: I may not mind your gawking all that much."

"I did notice. And I appreciate it: you look incredible."

"Well, thank you! But I thought you like athletic bods. I've put on some curves since my diving days."

"I would say you have. I don't think a wise coach would approve of this suit with your current assets, but a thorough coach might need a closer examination, in private perhaps."

"Is it too much? I don't want you to get the wrong idea on our first date."

"Too much for a school competition? If you don't want a riot, yes. Or fights to get into the bleachers. Too much for my heart, my blood pressure, seeing you now? We will have to see."

"So, if you keel over tonight with blood running out your ears, I should take it as a compliment?"

"Oh, the highest of compliments. Speaking of which, you have the most delightful, sweet trill of a laugh."

"Why thank you. Hey! Why the sudden sad face?"

"They're finally underwater. Lost to my sight. Two perfect mounds, firm and proud, straining for release from their gloriously overburdened spandex."

"My tits? You're talking - sonnetizing - about my tits?"

"Yep. Too much?"

"Not yet. I'll let you know if you cross any lines. You really liked them, though? Not too much?"

"There's that laugh again. And, no, not too much at all. Though almost too much for that suit. I don't think. Wait. Maybe...maybe they are a little too much. Maybe you should show them to me again."

"Yeah, you'd like that."

"Sure would. In order to give you the most complete answer to your question, of course."

"Of course. Why else would you want to see them? Okay. Close your eyes."

"My eyes? Why?"

"Just do what you're told if you ever want to see these glorious globes again."

"Are you touching them underwater? That's not fair."

"Shut them."

"Yes, sir. Ma'am. Eyes closed tight, ma'am."

"Keep them that way. Now. Picture them. Remember what you saw. Picture the snug Lycra barely managing to contain their lush, curvaceous beauty. Got that?"

"Mmmm. Yeah. I got it."

"So. Which do you like better, the ones you're picturing now, or...these?"

"Can I open my eyes?"

"Yes, silly. I don't think you can answer the question otherwise."

"Oh my...wow. Just wow."

"That's a good response. But not an answer."

"Uh. Which do I like better? These. Definitely. Wanna know why?"

"Sure."

"First, they're here, in sight, and my imagination was already doubting that my memory could possibly be accurate. Second, your swimsuit is now soaking wet. The lighter parts of that print are almost transparent, and not only can I see the raised details of two perfect nipples crinkled up, I can detect a hint of the darker color of the aureolas crowning them. They're...you're beautiful."

"Flatterer."

"When it's true, guilty as charged."

"I gotta say, you're kinda hot yourself. Char was right."

"She said that?"

"She said you were a hunk, but she was mainly talking about how you would look nude. From what little I see of your body, she was right. But you're cute too. Nice eyes, nice lips. I like a pretty face on a man."

"Pretty? I guess I can live with that."

"Good. Now I think I might like to give those pretty lips a kiss."

"I can live with that too. I think. There is still the threat of an embolism or an artery bursting, but it is worth the risk."

"But I don't want it to go too far. This is the first date, remember."

"I will exercise the utmost restraint. If those two are going to be pressed up close, I'll have to. Kiss away."

"Hmm. That was nice, but quite what I had in mind. Do you think it's okay if I sat on your lap?"

"Here in the tub?"

"Uh-huh."

"Climb on."

"Mmm. That was better."

"Let's make sure."

"This is okay, isn't it?"

"It feels better than okay to me."

"I mean...we won't go too far?"

"No. We won't."

"Promise?"

"Look. It's okay. We've still got our suits on, right?"

"Yeah."

"And we can't go too far while we're still dressed."

"I guess."

"Right?"

"Okay. We've still got our suits on."

"Right."

"That'll stop us, won't it?"

"Sure it will."

"From going to far?"

"Yeah. It's a double layer of defense. Yours and mine. This way we can relax, enjoy, and not have to worry about going too far, okay?"

"Okay. We just keep our suits on?"

"Yeah. And relax."

"And we're safe? Nothing can go wrong?"

"Not with our suits on."

"I feel better now."

"Yeah? Not just okay? How about when I do this?"

"Ohh. That's nice. Mmmm! Really nice. I like how that feels through my suit."

"That feels good? Now tell me, which feels better? This. Or this." 

"Oh. Wow. They're both...are you sure? This feels like we're going too..."

"Is your suit on? Mine is."

"We already agreed, right?" 

"We did. Suits stay on, nothing too far."

"Okay. Where were we?"

"You were letting me know which felt better. Does it still feel good?"

"Yes. Very."

Okay. Now let's make a new comparison. Here's this one again. Still good?

"Oh yeah."

"Now, you get to close your eyes."

"What? Why?"

"So you can concentrate on how it feels. That's why."

"Okay. I guess."

"Keep them closed."

"Oh. That feels cool. Wait are you...?"

"Shhh. Eyes closed."

"But..."

"Sh. Now tell me, does this feel better?"

"Hey! Oh. That's not...that's too far! Too far!"

"You didn't like that?"

"It's not about liking. That's was going too far. You were...undressing, exposing me. I thought you said we'd keep our suits on."

"Mine's on. Your's on?"

Mine was not on all the parts it was supposed to be on. If my suit was dangling from one ankle, would it be okay?"

"It'd be okay with me."

"Smarty. But it wouldn't do a dang thing to keep us from going way too far, would it?"

"Probably not. But we could try it, just to make sure."

"Dream on."

"I will. So, to make sure I understand, the suit has to stay covering the parts it's supposed to cover?" 

"Exactly."

"Like when I was nibbling on this part right here."

"Oh. Yes. That one. Nibbling through the suit. Yes."

"Like this."

"Yes. Oh. Yes. That way."

"That was okay? Not too far?"

"No, that was good. You can keep doing that if you like."

"Just good? Or very good?"

"Really really good. It's getting even better I think."

"That's good."

"Yeah. Like that."

"And the other way. Now, I'm not going to do it, because I realize now that that may lead to going too far, but that other way, when I took the edge of your suit and pulled it back, so this swell little spot I've been nibbling on was exposed, that was wrong, right?"

"Yes. Very wrong."

"And when I nibbled on it that way, nibbled on the same tender little part, but after I had exposed it, that was wrong too?"

"Oh yes. Really really wrong."

"Did it feel wrong?"

"What...yes! That's why I stopped you."

"Oh okay. I thought you stopped me because it might lead to something wrong, something too far."

"It was something too far!"

"And it was wrong?"

"Yes!"

"But did it feel good?"

"It felt...that's besides the point. The suit stays on. Covering what it's supposed to cover."

"So nothing extra gets exposed?"

"Exactly."

"I'm good with that."

"I hope so."

"On one condition."

"Here we go."

"That we keep playing 'which feels better'."

"Hmm. I think I can live with that. As long as everything stays covered."

"'Cause uncovering would lead to going too far."

"You catch on fast."

"Thank you. Now where was I? Oh yes, right here. So this is okay?"

"Oh yes. At least okay."

"Like this too?"

"Definitely like that."

"As long as it stays covered by the suit?"

"Yes please. You can keep doing that if you like."

"This way?"

"Yes. That way. More like that is...good."

"Just good? Not very good?"

"Very very very good."

"Oh look."

"What?"

"You have another, matching spot under the suit on this side. It's poking out too."

"Yes I do."

"Do you think it would feel good if I tried this..."

"Yes, that."

"On the other side?"

"I think you should try it. Just to compare."

"I think I will. But one more question first, just out of curiosity."

"Okay. One quick question."

"Before I understood about things needing to stay covered, I uncovered a certain part while your eyes were closed."

"That was very bad."

"Then I did something like this to it."

"Yes. Something like that."

"And I asked which felt better. Doing something like this."

"That's good."

"On a tender little spot covered by your suit. Or when the suit is pulled aside, and I could do it directly on your silky smooth, sensitive flesh."

"That was bad."

"Because it might lead to things too far?"

"Right."

"And I understand that now. Because I don't want to lead you to those scary too far things until our third date. But just out of curiosity, which felt better?"

"Didn't you already ask that question?"

"Didn't you evade answering it?"

"I probably shouldn't answer."

"But you will."

"I will. Once. So I want you to listen."

"I'm listening."

"There's a message here. Perhaps for you."

"I'm listening. I'm listening."

"You asked which felt better." 

"I did."

"And now you're listening for a message, a tip that may prove useful in the future, in my answer."

"I am."

"The way you used your lips and flicked your tongue, teasing me, teasing over and around my nipple, letting me feel just enough of those straight white teeth of yours through this thin Lycra spandex, making me start to squirm around a growing heat deep in my belly as you gradually let the intensity of your attentions increase. That's what you want me to compare. To the sensation of being suddenly and unexpected touched, on that same nipple, already aroused and sensitized and teased, in a manner that had been agreed upon as unambiguously off limits moments before."

"But I didn't..."

"Sh. Listen. Hear. Learn. So which felt better? Jumping in surprise at a jarring, clear and personal violation of my body and our agreement, or feeling the hungry fire a handsome man stokes in me, taking his time, by teasing me, touching me, sucking and licking and nibbling at me, through the thinnest, clingiest fabric imaginable, soaked and stretched tight across my otherwise naked form? Is that the question?"

"Well...I...didn't ask it quite that way, but I think you answered it."

"I think I did. You were listening."

"I told you I would."

"You did indeed. That's the kind of sign a girl looks for on a first date."

"Does that mean I'll get a second?"

"The second's a given, silly. Unless you do something obnoxious or stupid tonight, you're going to see me tomorrow, completely and totally nude."

"Can we play 'which feels better' tomorrow without the swimsuit?"

"Maybe. I think I'd like to find out what these soft lips of yours feel like on sensitive, bare skin...."

"But I already..."
