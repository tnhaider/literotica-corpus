 Do not reprint this work on any other website, or any medium, without the express consent of the author (me!).

Author's note: This story is a sequel to an earlier submission I wrote, "An Unlikely Encounter". I'm not particularly confident how much sense it will make if read by itself, as it is a direct continuation of the last story. It assumes the reader already knows the previous events and has already had a chance to have the character introduced. Read alone at your own risk!

I would like to express a special thanks to CalifornianBLonde, who convinced me this story was worth continuing and offered incredible encouragement, feedback, and inspiration.

Synopsis: In the previous story, a high school English teacher (the protagonist) finds himself being pursued by Autumn, one of his students. Autumn found herself in numerous 'unlikely situations' with her teacher outside of the classroom, and tried her best to take advantage of him during those meetings. She expressed her seduction through a series of writing assignments that she turned in to him. His reluctant attraction to her continued to grow, despite his resistance to her for both personal and professional reasons. Ultimately, his will crumbled at the end of the story, and they consummated their affair. This story picks up right where the last one leaves off, with the couple still in his girlfriend's home.
