Patrick had heard his dad and brother, David talk about the antique car show that weekend. They asked if he wanted to go but he said that he would have to pass this time. He had decided to take Thursday and Friday off and head to the lake. He needed to get away and have some alone time and think about some things in his life. 

He and ex-wife, Lisa had split mutually in their early 20's and remained friends; but, he was unhappy with the women he had been out with. There didn't seem to be any depth to some, others were always some kind of victim, and then the worst ones where the ones looking for what he could do for them. They wanted someone to spend money on them and that was the only way they would put out; or they were looking for a daddy for their kids without having any feelings for him. It was like fucking a warm corpse or someone going through the motions. He was sick of the games, or someone hoping he would come in and save them. He still had needs but sometimes it wasn't worth it if there wasn't any real feeling. He didn't have to be in love but a woman not afraid to be a women and comfortable with her sexuality. 

That Thursday morning, he ran around the city running errands. He was able to leave town a little after 11 that morning. He was relaxing more and more as he drove down the highway. He couldn't wait to get there. He had been looking forward to jumping in the lake all week. The humidity and temperatures had been breaking records. He didn't even have to move to feel the heaviness of the air and he was sick of clothes sticking to him. He decided he would run to town later after he saw what he may need at the cabin for the weekend

He got to the lake a little before 3pm. He noticed no one was there and thought it couldn't be more perfect. He parked his truck behind the cabin in the shade. He grabbed his bag and headed to the cabin, unlocking the door and going in. It smelt like home but was hot. He walked around and turned on the window units in the living room and the bedroom he and David shared. It had bunk beds that they with their dad had built when they were young teens. They were bigger than regular bunk beds. Patrick didn't really appreciate that until he got grown. A grown man could sleep comfortably in them. 

He dropped his bag on the bunk and took his socks and boots off. He took a pair of shorts out of the dresser and headed out the cabin door. He walked to the community pier. He got to end and dropped his shorts by the corner of the pier in case anyone pulled up; he would have something to put on to get out of the water.

He took his shirt off and felt what little air there was hit his sweaty skin. He unbuttoned his jeans, dropping them and his underwear right where he stood. He stepped out of his pants. He stood up on the corner railing, taking a deep breath and dove in. The water felt cold but great. He swam out about 50 ft and turned back headed back to the pier. Since no one was there, he swam to the shore, walked out of the water and headed to the end of the pier again. He grabbed his stuff and headed back up the hill to his cabin. The gate was far enough, that if anyone did come down the road or lake, he would hear them. 

He went in and dropped his clothes at the end of his bed, walked to the bathroom and grabbed a towel. He quickly dried off and pulled his shorts on. He went and laid in his dad's recliner. Feeling the air in the room cooling off, giving him a slight chill, he closed his eyes and drifted off to sleep.

When Patrick opened his eyes, the room was completely black and he could hear the crickets outside. He didn't know what time it was. He reached over to his right feeling for the lamp on the end table and turning it on. He looked up at the clock seeing that it was just past 6pm. He wandered to the kitchen turning on lights as he went. He looked around in the kitchen trying to see if there was anything to eat. He found a partial loaf of bread left from his parents' trip to the cabin last weekend in the fridge, some jelly and peanut butter. He thought it could be worse. Who doesn't like PB&J sandwiches? He was hungry enough that one just wasn't going to cut it. He would see if 2 held him. He decided to go ahead and make him a pitcher of tea since he would be here until Sunday. 

He couldn't believe that he slept so long but not surprised since he hadn't been sleeping too good here lately. Sexual frustration will do that to a person. He was tired of masturbating. He needed the touch of a woman. Masturbating was okay but just not the same. 

He took his sandwiches to the front porch, pulled out a chair and sat down. Except for the crickets and an occasional fish splashing the water, it was quiet. He was glad it was just him down there. He really didn't feel like being around or putting up with a lot of people. When he is figuring out and thinking about things, the last thing he wants to do is talk about it with just anyone. So many people are quick to tell you what you need to do without even having an idea of what they're talking about sometimes. 

After he finished his sandwiches, he noticed the mosquitoes were starting to bite him, so he headed in. He poured another glass of tea, walked into the living room, and turned on the TV. He got back into the recliner and flipped through the channels. After an hour or so, he realized there wasn't much of a selection to watch, he turned it off. He looked through some magazines and found a crossword puzzle book but that didn't interest him much either. 

Patrick wished he had female companion here tonight, someone to pass the time with. Not just a companion but someone that he would want to share his thoughts, feelings and can hold a conversation with. Someone that is not too timid and shy to explore her sexuality with. Sex with Lisa was great at first but doing the same positions over and over got old quick. She never wanted to try anything new, bedroom games or interested in any toys. She never really got into giving oral sex. If she didn't want to or if her heart wasn't into it, he wasn't going insist. He always tried to make sure she got hers and felt wanted, safe, and loved; but, over time he realized that he was not getting the same. He wanted to be wanted and needed. Over time, he realized that he couldn't live this way for another 30-50 yrs. Lisa seemed hurt but over time he realized that she wasn't shocked. 

He started thinking about a woman from work. Carol's husband was in the military and was stationed overseas. He was on his 2nd tour and she was finding it tough to get through the 2nd tour on her own. Over time she and Patrick would flirt a little but he thought she would never cheat on her husband; but, he liked the thoughts of her if she would. Finally she made the first move and asked him if he would be interested in dinner. He was curious and went along to see where it would lead. He got dinner and breakfast out of it. She told him that she trusted him and thought he would understand that it could only be sex. He agreed. He was amazed how she gave her whole self to him. She was an incredible lover and he made a memory of the night. 

Just remembering that night gave him an erection, he wished she was there right now. He stroked his cock and remembered her mouth on his cock. She loved giving head and was quite good at it. The look she gave him as she sucked him off is burned into his brain. She wanted ever inch of him and fucked him like he had never had been before. He thought about the noises she made when she came, the taste of her pussy and her hands on the back of his head when he ate her out. He had never had a woman get that wet before. He had had his share of women but not one that was that open about her wants and needs.

He could feel the building up within him. He pictured her on top riding him in the pace she wanted. The bounce of her breasts, the squeal she let out as he squeezed her nipples. She came several times but that was the hardest she came. It took everything out of her. She was beautiful when she came. He flipped her over and fucked the shit out of her as she came 2 more times. When he came, he felt like he could have knocked holes in the wall. About that time his build up was coming to head. He stroked his cock a few more strokes and he started cum.

He laid there for a minute and realized he needed a towel. He went to rise up out the chair and felt light-headed. He thought how he needed that. He went to the bathroom and washed up. He decided to head for bed and get an early start tomorrow. He needed to change the oil in his truck and wanted to get it done before it got too hot.

He got up the next morning feeling well rested. He decided that he would take a shower later after he got done with his truck. He threw on his shorts from last night and an old T-shirt. He got the sack with the oil filter and motor oil out of the toolbox along with his tools. He popped the hood and began working. Took him most of the morning to get it done, checked the radiator, air filter and cleaned out his truck. He went to the back of the cabin and began cleaning his hands. 

He decided to go in and fix him a sandwich and get a drink. He was soaking wet from the heat. He ate his sandwich and was getting sleepy with the cool air in the cabin giving him chills from being all sweaty. He decided that after a nap he would go to town and get some food to get him through the weekend. He took his shirt off and lay on the couch with a pillow under his head and dozed off. He slept for a couple of hours waking up with cotton mouth. His glass was empty so he went to the kitchen and got a glass of water then another. He went to the bathroom to take a piss. As bad as he didn't want to get back in the heat, he needed to put up everything he left laying outside. He decided to get it over with and maybe take another dip. 

***************************************************

Sometimes if Dawn needed a break from college but really didn't have the time or want to drive all the way home, she would go to her family cabin. It was a little less than half way home. Sometimes if her dad could get away, he and/or her brother would meet her there. Her mom had left when she was little but stayed in contact from time to time. They were more like their dad. They liked the outdoors, simple living and found happiness in small ways. When they could meet up, they would catch up with each other. 

Dawn called her dad earlier in the week and told him she was thinking about going to the cabin that weekend. He told her that he and her brother, Ricky had tickets for an antique car show that weekend and couldn't make it. She asked if he minded if she went without them. He said "No, go and have fun". Craig felt better if she was at the lake instead of school. You had to have a key to get through the gate and it was a pretty safe place to be for a 19 yr old girl. If she was ever in danger, he had plenty of guns there and made sure his son, Ricky and Dawn knew how to shoot and have respect for them. 

On that Friday, she had turned in her assignments and was able to leave earlier than normal. She hurried to her dorm, quick change out of her clothes into a pair of cut off shorts and tank top over her purple bikini. She grabbed her bags, loaded her car, and headed out of town. On the drive there she couldn't wait to jump in the lake and cool off. She had signed up for summer classes this year trying to get her schooling done sooner. It had been a hot summer already and the humidity was almost unbearable.  

After an hour and 40 minutes she pulled up to the gate, unlocked it and was excited to be here. She was already starting to relax and was looking forward to being down there alone. It made her feel like a grown up. She locked the gate back and drove the mile to the cabins. She pulled her car into her dad's normal parking spot and got out. She wanted to jump in the lake before she unloaded the car. Walking across a small grassy field she looked around and realized no one was at the cabins. It was a little early and knew that she had almost a couple of hours before anyone got there. 

***************************************************

As Patrick was walking out the door, he could hear what sounded like someone coming down the road into camp. He knew it would take a few minutes so he walked around the truck picking up trash and his tools. He dropped all his tools by the front of the truck to put in his tool box all at once. About that time he heard a car pull in. He could tell from the direction that it stopped at Mr. Craig's place. He stepped out from behind the truck, was going to whistle and wave but; stopped when he saw who got out of the car. He knew that car. He could not believe how grown Dawn was now. She was beautiful. 

He always had a soft spot for Dawn. She was a pretty little girl with a big heart that had a mouth that would crack him up sometimes. He was teasing her once and she said "Why do you pick on me so much?" He said "He wouldn't pick on her if he didn't like her so much". She shot right back at him and said "Stop liking me so much!!!" as she walked off mad. She was just so cute when she got mad. 

As he watched her get out and looks over at the lake, he felt a stirring in him and decided to step back behind his truck. He was tingling, but only could think that this is Mr. Craig's baby girl and Ricky's little sister. What the hell was he thinking??? He looked out from his truck again and didn't see her. He thought she must be in the cabin. 

**********************************************

She walked out onto the community pier that everyone used and helped to build. She lifted her tank over her head as she walked. She got to the end, kicked her flip-flops off and finished taking her shorts off. She looked around one more time and since no one was around or out on the lake, she took her bikini off. She loved to swim nude. It felt freeing and sensual. She always kept her bikini hanging on a hook at the end of the pier that usually held a fish basket. That way if anyone pulled up, she could slip it back on and no one was the wiser. 

After she slipped off her bottoms, she climbed up on the railing in the corner; stood there for a sec and dove in. The water felt cold compared to the sun beating down and felt her skin began to cool off from the dip. She came up, swam around for a little ways and just floated on her back for a while. When her skin got to warm, she would just go back under water to cool off. She liked floating there and looking up at the sky. She felt one with nature when she swam like this. She had her own little private heavenly moment, something that was all hers.

*************************************************

He heard footsteps on the community pier. He walked to the other side of the cabin to see what she was doing. When he stepped out from the cabin, he saw her tank hit the pier and she was kicking off her flip-flops and removing her shorts. She was standing there in a string bikini with a killer body. Then he noticed her look around and began taking off her top and bottoms. He didn't realize his mouth was open a little and all he could do was stare at her. Her brown and auburn hair fell mid-way past her shoulders, pale skin, had a medium frame with breasts that had small pale pink areoles and nipples. She looked to have C cups maybe even D's. The stirring in him was now turning into a full throbbing hard on in his shorts. He watched her get up on the railing and dive in. When she came up he watched her swim and then rolled on her back with her breasts fully exposed and a glimpse of her bush as she floated on her back. Her nipples were hard now. He could not believe what he was seeing. He thought to himself, "How old is she now? Is she even legal?"

***************************************************

After she had cooled off enough, she swam to the end of the pier and grabbed her bikini. She slipped her bottoms on. Pulled her top over her head still tied and swam to the shore. She walked out of the water tying her strings around her back. She squeezed the water out of her hair and twisted it to help get the rest of the water out of it. She walked up on the pier, grabbed her shorts, top and walked to her car. 

She needed to unload the car and see what groceries she needed to get from town to last the weekend. She grabbed her keys, purse, and pushed the button to open the trunk. She crammed her shorts and tank into one of her bags. She grabbed everything and headed to the door. She put one of her bags down so she could unlock the door. Opening the door, she could smell that familiar smell of home and feel the heat in the room. She took everything to her room and dropped everything on the bed. She turned on the window unit in her room and into the living room to turn on that window unit. She left Craig's and Ricky's off and just shut their doors. She didn't need the whole cabin and hoped it would cool off faster. 

**************************************************

When he saw her swimming for the pier and grabbed her suit, he stepped back behind the cabin. He didn't want her to see him and think he was perverted but that's exactly what he was. He wanted to go into the cabin but she would see him and possibility his erection. He heard her walk back on the pier and after a couple of minutes, heard her truck open then shut. He peaked from behind the other side of the cabin and saw her heading in the door of the cabin.

As soon as her door shut, he headed into his cabin shutting the door quietly and went straight to the bathroom. He pulled out his cock and began stroking himself. Pictures of her in and out of that bikini, floating in the water bare-breasted was causing him to tingle all over. It was erotic seeing her being free like that. "She was fucking beautiful" he thought. He could feel the pressure building and knew he was about to cum harder than he did last night. Then he felt the eruption, got goose bumps all over.

He stood there for what seem a minute and sat down on the toilet. He kept thinking "Is she even 18"? He cleaned up and went a got another glass of water. He headed back out to finish putting up his tools. He felt relaxed and was not thinking about what he was doing. He opened the passenger door and then couldn't remember what he was doing. He realized he needed to put up the tools at the front of the truck. He shut the door and headed to the front of the truck. He squat down and put his tools in the tool box. He sat there for a few minutes trying to collect himself and figuring out what was he feeling for this girl. He thought "She doesn't look like a girl but a woman". 

***************************************************

Dawn grabbed a towel from the bathroom and wrapped her hair up to keep it from dripping. She went around seeing what she would need from town. Really she just needed some bread, milk, maybe some lunchmeat and if she wanted any soda. The cabin had can goods, several things in the freezer to cook and plenty of toiletries. She decided to just take her swimsuit off and put her shorts and tank back on for the trip into town. Instead of putting a regular bra on, she opted for a sports bra and no underwear, who would know. 

She sat on the side of her bed and unraveled her hair. She grabbed her brush from her bag and began to get the knots out. She could feel that the room had started to cool off from when she first got there. As she was brushing her hair, she heard a car door shut but didn't hear anyone pull up. She got up, walked to the living room and opened the front door. She stepped out and looked in the direction she thought it came from, the Miller's cabin. She didn't see anyone or a vehicle so she walked across the small open field to their place.
