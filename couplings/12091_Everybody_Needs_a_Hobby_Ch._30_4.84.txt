 ** Second week of November **

The year was blazing by and though it seemed chaotic, everyone had found their groove. My lover Britt, and her two besties, Gina and Kate, were fully ensconced at the university, bearing down the home stretch and looking forward to the end of the fall semester and the winter break. All three of my comely roommates were excited about heading back east to be with their families for Christmas and they continued to badger me to tag along.

Work for me, and I'm somewhat embarrassed to call it work as I enjoy it so much; well it couldn't be going any better. I'm pretty much booked into February of next year and I've actually had to turn away some jobs. Thankfully the work is varied, everything from portraits and family shoots to the commercial side, with a couple more calendars on the books. I've been shooting a lot of product stills for websites and printed catalogs and such. I've also gotten some inquiries from a couple other television stations after those that I'd shot earlier for another station began to air. Those were simple portraits that I then blended with background shots from around the city and were used as promotional pieces and even in some of the stills they did for lead-ins to the various news programs.

So there we were, Britt and I enjoying a quiet Saturday morning eating breakfast at the kitchen island; "Hey baby," she said, obscenely taking a bite off a banana.

"Yeah, lover?"

"I forgot to tell you, but Margo called yesterday about another shoot," she said, her tongue taking a sexy swipe over her lips.

"Uh, Margo...Margo," I stalled, feigning ignorance on who Margo was.

"Yeah, nice try there studly," she chirped, giving me a snarky grin. "You know good and well who Margo is and she sounded just as intriguing over the phone as you said she was in person."

"Oh, that Margo, from the T.V. station," I said, along with a head slap for emphasis.

"You're so full of it," she laughed, taking another bite off the phallic fruit. "Anyway, we talked for quite a while and I think I really like her. She was calling because she is interested in putting together some kind of portfolio; seems like she has had some inquiries lately about doing some modeling. She said it all started after the shots you took of her for the news program, but I think she's just trying to butter you up." Britt paused and took a sip of coffee and gave me that questioning/accusing look, you know, the one with the one raised eyebrow.

"Yeah, okay," holding up my hands up in surrender; "She did seem pretty flirty, but like I said before, I didn't instigate anything; I'm completely innocent."

"Yeah, yeah," she snorted as she reached for her coffee; "You could have played that innocent card before we met, but I know better now." She winked before taking a sip. "Anyway, I told her that we probably couldn't schedule anything until after the New Year and she was okay with that."

"Well," I said, looking down at my plate, stirring around the bit of egg I had left; "I could probably do her...I mean, I could probably slip her in...well shit, you know, I could probably shoot her while you guys are gone." 

"Fat chance, buddy," she laughed, standing up and grabbing her plate and heading toward the sink. She rinsed off the plate and the turned toward me, wiping her hands on a towel; "I trust you baby, but I'm not so sure I trust her. I kind of got a vibe over the phone." She hung the towel on the rack and walked up behind me, pressing her boobs into my back and reaching around me to hug me, her hands wandering over my pecs and nibbling on my ear.

"Oh really, and what kind of vibe was that?" I asked as I reached back and ran my hand over the back of her thigh, playing with the cuff on her short shorts.

"Well," she purred in my ear, "she tried to make it sound business-like, but there were some personal things mixed in and her voice would change when she strayed. There's no doubt in my mind that she finds you interesting, but I think her interests may be broader than that."

"Really," I said softly as my hand found its way under the leg of her shorts and cradled her perfect butt cheek. She shifted sideways enough to give me a better grip and purred louder.

"Yes," she said softly, her hand under my shirt, her fingers teasing my nipples; "She asked me if I sometimes helped you with the shoots and when I answered yes; well, she quickly asked if I would be there when she came in for her portfolio shots. I told her I could probably arrange to be there and she said that she would like that as she was kind of nervous and all because she'd want a variety of shots. It was cute because then you could hear her get all shy and stuff and she said that she wasn't sure how comfortable she'd be posing in a swimsuit." Britt tugged on my earlobe with her teeth as she tortured my nipples.

I'd had about enough of the teasing and quickly spun and had a surprised blonde in my lap. I took her lips with mine and we kissed, our tongues intertwined as my hands now skirted under her tight top until I found an excited nipple. She squirmed in my lap, moaning into our kiss until I had to come up for air; "So, we both know she's not shy; I told you about her changing her tops in front of me. Her back was always to me, but it was a really nice back."

Britt took a nip at my nose and I quickly tweaked a nipple which brought her up short, biting her lip instead, eyes closed as I played. I rolled her taut nips between my thumbs and index fingers and she ground her ass into my lap. There's a direct connection between my lover's nipples and her pussy, which was surely wet now; "And you don't think I could resist a woman if she came on to me?" I gave a little tug and she moaned louder, her eyes shut so tight, her forehead wrinkled. She shifted in my lap, trying to straddle my thigh as I nuzzled her neck with my stubble-covered chin. I could feel the heat on my bare thigh as she straddled my leg with her back to me, leaning forwarded, trying to get some bearing on her anxious sex. I held her by the tits now as she kicked her legs, trying to rock on my thigh. It had to have been a sight, like a dog humping your leg and I quickly told myself not to relate that little vision to her later.

"Shit baby," she moaned, getting a foot-hold on the barstool leg. Between her hands on my knees and her bare foot on the chair leg, she had found her rhythm and the only thing to keep her from falling on her nose was my grip on her breasts. I thumbed her erect nipples, feeling her wetness on my leg soaking through the crotch of her shorts; I decided a little tease would put her over the edge.

"You're probably right baby, I got the feeling that Margo would have stayed and fucked me if the sports guy hadn't shown up." Britt moaned in reply as I continued; "I probably would have let her too, I get the sense that she pretty much gets whatever she wants. She has a great figure from what I could see, and a nice rack," giving her nipples a little twist which elicited another low moan. "Her butt was shapely," I continued; "it looked good and firm and she has long legs; I could see them because of the tight pants she wore...real tight." More moaning; "I'll bet she gives good head too, full lips and very soft too."

"Nnghgghh," my horny blonde groaned; it sounded like a question.

"Oh, I didn't tell you that Margo kissed me? Hmmm...," tweaking her nipples once more. "Yeah, she's a good kisser, talented tongue too." Britt growled now but never broke stride; "I wonder if she shave's her pussy?" I queried and Britt moaned once more, the pace picked up. "I'll bet she just has a landing strip," I kept up, "a soft curly patch just above her plump pussy...Hmmm, I wonder what Norwegian pussy tastes like? I bet it's sweet, like butterscotch." 

Evidently Britt likes butterscotch, "Oh Gawd!!" She cried as her body tensed and shook, her orgasm taking control of her. I held on tight, careful not to move her from her perch until she was spent. Only then did I pull her back to my chest and hugged her. Nibbles at her ear sent small shockwaves through her until she let out a final big sigh.

"You okay baby?"

"Couldn't be better baby," she purred; "Hey, do you know if we have any butterscotch pudding mix in the pantry? I've suddenly got a craving."

I laughed and hugged her tighter before standing up with her in my arms and heading toward the bedroom.

***Later that morning***

Laughter from across the great expanse echoed through the warehouse; "That's too much laughter for much work to be getting done," I mumbled to Britt as I worked on some photo touchup from a shoot I did earlier in the week of a local doctor and his family. 

Britt giggled as she was hunkered over her laptop working on some billing; "You're just jealous," she said. "Anyway, I can think of plenty of times you've had fun working...maybe not laughing, but moaning and panting can be fun." I glanced over in time to see her shift in her seat and lick her lips as she squinted at the screen.

"Yeah, I guess; anyway, I'm glad their business is doing well. Gina said they had a bunch of orders to ship out today and most of them out of the country. I'm really kind of surprised that someone would buy clothing of any kind from half-way across the globe; hell, anything I've ever bought on-line didn't fit worth a damn and I had to send it back."

"Well first off," she replied as she stood and stretched that long, lean body I worship; "A lot of places don't have any stores that carry the kinds of suits the girls have and honestly, as skimpy as some of them are, the fit is kind of secondary." She said this as she leaned over in front of me to collect a kiss, giving me a birds-eye view of her perky tits playfully jiggling under the cropped t-shirt she wore. Britt's kisses never fail to warm the nether regions and I began to cramp up a little in my shorts.

"Hey, that's a cute family," she said after taking my breath away and looking at the image I had on the screen of the happy family. I was about to reach down and try and discreetly adjust myself; "Have you ever thought about having kids?" Suddenly the adjustment was no longer needed and she went back to her computer.

"Uhhh...," I managed before my brain locked up, making sure that my mouth didn't spew forth with what would surely be an incorrect response. "Well, I guess not," I managed as my brain now searched for the rest of the answer; "I mean, I haven't really thought about it, like made a plan or anything...you know."

Britt tried to hide a smirk while looking studious as she continued to stare at the spreadsheet on the screen in front of her; "Yeah, well I haven't put it on my calendar or anything but I do want kids someday...no," she paused, "what I want is a family."

I waited for her to continue, feigning interest in tweaking the photo of the happy family on the screen. I was just about to give in and make another questionably wise comment when she mercifully continued; "I don't see it happening anytime soon, but I do want to have a traditional family someday, you know, the full deal with a house and a yard and a couple of kids, one girl and one boy...oh and a dog. The kids need a dog." 

Again, I just let it alone; "Do you like cats?" she asked as she spun her chair to face me. I stalled for a second before swiveling to face her. She looked so sexy sitting there with her long bare legs stretched out in front of her, wiggling her pretty toes. Her long legs disappeared into a small pair of cut-offs so short that the front pocket liners stuck out beyond the bottom of the leg. A light blue cut-off tank top made up the rest of her outfit, her nipples stretching the fabric taut.

I could feel her eyes on me as I took in the sights; "I'm a big fan of pussy," I replied, my eyes locked on to hers, waiting for a snarky rebuttal.

She never blinked; her tongue sneaking out of between her lips, just the tip. I think she just covertly stuck her tongue out at me, but before I could reply; "I'm a big pussy fan too, but I'm talking felines, the four-legged kind. Do you think our kids should have a cat?"

She said this while my eyes followed her right hand on its tour over her thighs before coming to a rest where my tongue wanted to be. The little bit of my brain that didn't have a strangle-hold on my cock screamed out; 'She said 'our kids', numb-nuts; pay attention!' "Uh, our kids?" My eyes still mesmerized by her finger playing along the seam that overlaid her precious slit.

"Up here Daddy," she giggled and like a cat, eyes locked onto the red dot of a laser-pointer, my eyes followed her finger upward until I was staring at her smiling face. About then the rest of my brain caught up with that small sliver that tried to shake me and the look on my face must have been one of pure terror. Britt's eyes grew big and then she laughed out loud and then quickly clamped her mouth shut with her hand. 

The clutch in my brain slipped, my brain free-spinning as I started to stutter, "Are you...are we preg...?" I couldn't finish the word; maybe if you didn't say it, it wasn't so.

"Oh baby," she frowned with a look of real compassion in her eyes as she stood up and slid into my lap and hugged me, my head nestled in her bosom, the place where our babies would nurse, their mommy nurturing them. 'I'm not ready to share,' a greedy part of my brain shouted as I tried to burrow my head into her soft cleavage. She ran her fingers through my hair lovingly, enjoying the moment and then whispered quietly, "No baby, I'm, no; we're not pregnant."

Relieved, I guess, I re-played her reply in my head, trying to discern the tone in her voice. Was it a sad tone, sad that she wasn't really pregnant or was it a sad tone, sad that she had scared the living shit out of me? I slowly turned my head to look up at her, not missing the chance to pepper little kisses on her breast. She looked at me with those glistening blue eyes, her soft fingers brushing the hair out of mine; "We're not pregnant," she repeated. "I'm sorry if I scared you but," and she paused to kiss me softly, "You know I will have your babies someday...not soon, but some day."

My heart had slowed to its normal cadence and now began to melt. I laced my fingers behind her head and pulled her back down for another kiss, only this one longer, passionate; "Nothing would make me happier than to make a baby with you, two babies, a dozen, as many as you want. I would have the luckiest children in the world if you were their mother."

"Oh god," she gasped, her lower lip quivering and I kissed her again and I could feel her tears of joy on my cheek. The kiss was long and loving but quickly turned to passionate and ravenous. Our tongues battled as we writhed on my crowded chair and my leg began to cramp. Without losing connection, I stood up with her in my arms and headed toward the queen-size bed that made up a part of the upstairs studio. 

I stood her upright at the foot of the bed and we tore at each other's clothes before I unceremoniously picked her up by the waist and threw her onto the bed. Naked, she spread her legs and her right hand returned to her pussy, the denim shorts no longer in the way. I stood there and stared down on my love, the future mother of my children and took in her splendor. My eyes ran from her sexy feet and up her sumptuous body until our eyes locked. Her blue eyes now shown black, the tell-tale sign of her degree of lust, the darker, the hornier...hers now made coal like a shade of grey. 

Her eyes now strayed from mine, moving downward, locking onto the hard cock in my hand, the one I'd absentmindedly been stroking, the head shiny from the pre-cum percolating to the tip. My eyes followed hers and then made their own trip, where her hands now rested between widespread legs, fingers parting the soft pink petals of her flower. Her nectar coated her flower and like a bee, I was powerless to resist. I crawled up onto the bed between her long limbs until I was hovering above her bloom. With my hands on either side of her, I leaned in for a kiss. Magically, un-assisted, the bee found the bloom and we groaned into our kiss as the pollination began.

Slow and deliberate, we came together, her nectar washing over my pulsating member as I planted my own seed deep inside her bloom. Too tired to talk, nothing needed said anyway, I rolled us to our side, still joined and we drifted off, wrapped in each other's embrace.

**Sometime later**

"Wakey, wakey," softly whispered in my ear. I felt a small, warm hand caressing my butt. Another sweet voice beckoned my love from her slumber and Britt just grumbled and pushed in tighter, her pussy hugging my flaccid cock. 

"Such a deal," Gina groused now loud enough to wake sleeping beauty. "We're downstairs busting our butts to get these orders out and these two are up here fuckin' around."

"Yeah," little Kate joined in, her hand still kneading my butt; "They should have yelled down to us. I'd have taken a break for a quickie," she giggled.

"I don't think there's such a thing as a quickie around here," Gina laughed as Britt mumbled some kind of expletive about being left alone. "George, lover," she continued as I managed to pry one eye open to look up at her; "We're done with our orders and we were going to go drop them off to ship. While we were boxing things up, Katie and I thought about Christmas coming up and since we're in the shipping mode, maybe we would go ahead and get our shopping done for the family and ship it out ahead of our trip home."

"Yeah," the little one chimed in, "it'll be weird not rushing around last minute. We were going to ask your girlfriend if she wanted to go with us, but we can see that she's probably not in the mood," giggling and raking her long nails up my side, sending shivers up my spine.

"Yeah, so while we're out, we'll probably grab dinner, so don't worry about us. We'll let you know when we're on our way home so you can drag your sexy butts out of bed. Oh, and while you were napping, Becky called and left a message on the machine." With that, the brunette leaned down and placed a kiss on Britt and my cheeks after which Katie opted for the lower cheeks. "Come on you butt freak," Gina snickered, "if we don't get with it, the postal place will close before we get there."

Kate giggled, giving Britt's butt a little nip and they both said goodbye laughing all the way down the stairs. I listened until I heard the big door rolling closed behind them and pulled Britt closer and nodded off again.

**Late afternoon, I think**

"My butt's cold," Britt pouted, trying to get closer yet and reaching back to try and find some covers. I reached down and ran my hand over her butt that really did have goose-bumps on it.

"Poor baby, you are cold." I rolled her over onto her back and lay on top of her, careful not to crush her. "There, does that help?" I grinned down at her and peppered her sweet face with little kisses.

"Yeah, that helps a lot," kissing me while snaking her hand between us and taking me in her hand; "Eww," she teased, "you're all sticky!"

"Well," I replied, stealing another kiss; "If you check, I think you'll find that most of that is your fault," rolling over until she was now on top of me. Her tits were too tempting and I pulled her up until I had one within lips reach. Britt purred as I switched from one to the other before breaking free and slipping off the bed, standing beside it. 

"Let's see who made this mess," leaning over and taking my half-hard cock between her lips. Her tongue played on my cock which came out of her mouth shining. Licking her lips, she smacked them a couple times; "I think it's a draw. I'll take some of the blame, or credit, but I think you are equally at fault here. Regardless, you're a sticky mess and I think a shower is in order," she smiled, offering her hand. I thought briefly about climbing back into bed, but I was starting to get cold too, so the warm shower made a lot of sense; that and the fact that the shower was a fun place to play as well and we had the place to ourselves.
