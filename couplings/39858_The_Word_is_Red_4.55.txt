 This story begins with me picking up the phone, and giving my good friend Simon a call.

"Drrring rrring rrring, drrring rrring rri- CLICK"

"Sup?" Short and to the point, that's me. They say brevity is the soul of wit, and I believe it.

"Not much." Simon can be pretty curt, too.

I ask, "Party at your place tonight?"

"Yeah." ...but I daresay that in his case it's more due to a complete and utter lack of wit.

"Anyone I know going to be around?"

"Jamie and Ruth and maaaybe Alphonso. I'm sure some other people will show up as well."

"What about Maya?" This is the question I'm really calling to ask. The question that's making me lean forward in my chair to prevent my heart from beating its way out of my chest.

"Maya who?" Oh, he knows. He knows who she is, and from the smugness of his voice I can tell he also knows how badly I want to know.

"Bitch please. Even if Ruth burned your eyes out you'd never forget about Maya."

"I'm going to refrain from commenting on that statement. But to answer your question, I believe that the omens favor the possibility of Maya blessing us with her presence. Or maybe I'm just saying that, because I know you'll show up if there's even the slightest chance of her being there."

"Yeah yeah yeah yeah, you're fucking Nostradamus and we should all bow down before your Eye of True Sight."

"No dude, I'm fucking Ruth. And you're not fucking anything that isn't your hand, or a figment of your imagination."

"Hey, show some respect, my ingenious imagination has gotten us out of many a tight spot."

"Sure it has. Especially that one time with the shutting yourself inside a dumpster to hide from Mr. Muscles wanting to show you a real good time. But unless you've suddenly turned into some prodigy of secret keeping then that oh-so-clever head of yours hasn't been getting you into any tight spots recently."

"Which brings us back to my original question. Is Maya coming tonight?"

"Dude. Just give it up already. She's not interested and - no NO let me finish - she'd go through you like a hot knife through butter. That girl is on fire. Hellfire. There wouldn't be anything left of you but a flaming husk. Ten men from the fire brigade wouldn't be enough to safely handle that girl." I take back what I said earlier, Simon isn't terse and witless, he's just a witless scaredy cat. A pussy.

"Oh, don't be melodramatic. So what if she's got a little spunk in her, b-"

"SNORT COUGH BLERGH. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that. Please, go on."

"...ut I like that. I'd do anything to get down and dirty with Maya."

"I'll be ready with the super cooled water when your balls are on fire."

"You still haven't told me whether or not she's coming."

"Yes. Your untimely death by combustion will most likely occur tonight."

"Lighten up Simon. Worst case scenario: I die from a heart attack." And I'd die a happy man at that.

--

I love Simon's little get-togethers. The music isn't too loud. People always bring booze and often weed, and sometimes even a strong desire to cook. Especially as the night winds down. The only thing that tops stuffing your face with blueberry pancakes at 2AM is stuffing your face with blueberry pancakes at 2AM while the girl on the other side of the table is staring into your eyes while slowly licking jam off her fingers. Two weeks ago Maya was that girl.

It's not that I didn't notice Maya before that happened - with her shapely bottom swaying as she walks by and her fine bosom on proud display she's hard to miss. And I always thought she was a nice looking girl. But there are a lot of nice looking girls. Especially when you like tall girls, short girls, skinny girls, chubby girls, smart girls, funny girls, quirky girls, girls with big boobs, girls with small boobs, girls with...you get the idea. As long as a girl's got the ass and face of a woman and an IQ not too far into the double digits, I'm pretty much sold. So up until I saw what her mouth could do to her finger, the idea of Maya was one I entertained - but not one I focused on at the expense of all other thoughts.

But watching her mouth and tongue play with her finger in that slow seductive fashion...it was so incredibly sexy. It's one thing to be good looking girl, but it's a whole 'nother thing to look someone in the eyes and tell them - without even saying a word - 'I'm practically sex on wheels'. I was enchanted. Just like that. The way her eyes met mine, the way she held her body, it made me want her like I've never wanted anyone before in my life. And then she gave me a coy little smile, got up, and walked away. My mouth still full of pancakes, I was too dumbfounded to do more than slowly work my jaws. It was like seeing the sun for the first time, and then having it taken away moments later. You can't help but crave more. So you can understand why I so wanted to know whether or not Maya was going to be there tonight. I needed time to prepare myself mentally, lest I be left in a daze yet again.

--

Tonight was going to be a night like any other. And that's what it started out like. The shit was shot with great precision and to general acclaim, fresh gossip was eagerly shared around the proverbial campfire, and I even managed to not stare too much at Maya whenever we were in the same room. But eventually most of the guests drifted on towards bars, dance floors, concerts, or home to a warm and comfortable bed. The exodus complete we were left with me, Simon, Jamie, and Ruth. And Maya. Ruth is Simon's girlfriend, and Jamie is Simon's co-tenant. Maya is a childhood friend of Ruth, and Simon swears she's trouble even though he refuses to tell me what makes him think that. I'm not sure if he's just fucking with me, or if telling me which girls are "trouble" is genuinely his idea of looking after me. Then again, maybe he knows me well enough to realize that trouble is just what I'm after and he's actually subtly stoking the fire.

As we're sitting there, Ruth leans in and starts up a private conversation with me.

"So I heard you asked about Maya."

Before she spoke I was looking at Maya's fingernails. They were painted red, and I was picturing myself letting those fingers slide into my mouth, in any number of more or less probable circumstances. Sitting in front of her, worshipping her hands one finger at a time, treating her like a goddess deserves. Sitting over her, with my crotch against her chest, holding her hand up to my mouth and ravaging it, biting it, sucking on it. All the while my cock growing harder and harder, pressing into her. Grinding myself all over stomach and tits, pushing my painfully hard self up against her face. Holding her hands and running them down my body, letting her fondle my manhood through my pants, opening one button at a time, and finally...

"So I heard you asked about Maya."

I give Simon the death stare. Fucking snitch.

"Yeah, I wanted to know who was coming."

"Oh please. Dear Lord save me from men who think they can fool me. Did you ask specifically about everyone else as well?"

She said it in that sweet sing-song, 'I know you're lying' voice.

In an attempt to defeat her with my wit I say, "Grumble grumble."

"Oh relax I'm just teasing."

I wasn't convinced. That cute little smile of hers might melt Simon, but I knew something was going on. It's not paranoia if they're really out to get you.

"Why are you interested in my asking about Maya? It's a free country, I can ask anyone whatever I want."

"Oh wow, Mr. Defensive is in da house. If you're so 'free', why don't you ask Maya if she likes you?"

With carefully arranged facial features I reply in my most neutral tone, "Why would I want to ask her if she likes me?"

"Come on, didn't I just tell you not to try and fool me? I know you're into her. The way you were looking at her makes me pretty sure you're not only into her - you'd like to be into her too, if you know what I'm saying." Ruth ended her sentence with a cartoonish caricature of a wink, scrunching up her face with a grin.

Like a deer in the headlights I don't know which way to turn, and just end up croaking out, "Does she know?"

"I don't know if she knows how into her you are but I bet she's seen you looking."

Pull yourself together man. This isn't the time to get nervous. Step up!

"Okey-okey! What do I do?!"

"I'm pretty sure just talking to her would be a good start."

"Easy for you to say, you've known her since forever!"

"Yes. So when I tell you just talk to her, you should listen."

"Simon says she's trouble."

"Well...he's got a point. Kind of."

"What kind of trouble?"

At this point Ruth shifts uncomfortably and glances away for a second.

"Come on. If I'm going to talk to her I should know if there's reason to be careful."

"Alright, alright. I'm not going to tell you all about it though, it's really not something I should be sharing."

"But?"

"I'll give you a hint. Let me think."

And she starts smiling and giggling. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? The funny kind of trouble? Maybe Maya is secretly a psychopathic clown. Ruth collects herself, and starts spilling the juice.

"Ok, I'll tell you. She's...uhm...kinda...kinky?"

"That's not very specific."

"It's the kind of thing not that many people are into."

"What kind of thing? I like things - all kinds of things. Want a list?"

"I'll pass on the list. And if you want to know more you'll have to ask Maya."

"I can't just up and ask her 'hey, so I heard you're a kinky girl, want to compare lists?'"

"You'll never know if you don't try."

"I'm going to need more booze."

"...men."

"Want me to get something for you?"

"No I think I'm good for now. Also, don't get anything for Simon, if he drinks any more he won't be able to 'perform' later."

"TMI"

"You have no right to complain, not after just offering to give me a list of all the kinky shit you'd be willing to do."

"Hey! It's a pretty long list, I'll give you that, but shit is not on it."

Unfortunately (or fortunately) there was at that moment a lull in both the music and the conversation, and Simon caught the end of what I said.

"What kind of long list do you have that doesn't have shit on it? If it doesn't have shit on it then it's got nothing on it! You've got to be even more drunk than I am! Ruth, what kind of paradoxical list was he on about?"

Ruth casts a glance towards Maya, and flashes me a smile. Oh no...

"His list of kinks. It apparently has a lot on it - but at the same time it doesn't have shit on it. Oh yeah, he told me he'd do anything, especially if a certain someone asked nicely."

Jamie throws his inebriated self into the fray, calling for a toast and a song.

"To Mat! May he live forever in a castle full of men and women all trying to fuck him in every kinky way imaginable!"

"But no shit." Ruth chimes in.

"Oooh Mat's a kinky bastard, yeah Mat's kinky baaastard, Mats a kinky baaa-aastard...

And he loves to fuck and get fucked."

"Yeah he loves to fuck and get fucked - especially in the ass by a big hairy black guy."

"Or two!" What the fuck Simon, I thought you were my friend.

"Or two." And Ruth too?! Bastards.

Not one to be perturbed for long or be put to shame, I quip:

"Two is bit much. One might make the list, but two is just overkill." 

--

As it happens, the booze worked its mysterious magic, and I somehow ended up in Maya's company on my way home. All hail the great Lord Alcohol! So we're chatting away and she says: "Can I ask you a question?"

"Of course, you can ask me anything." I reply with my most genuine smile.

"Anything huh?"

She gives a slight pause, and actually looks down and away, as if though she's embarrassed.

"So...you meant what you said? You'd really do just about anything? In bed, I mean."

Now she doesn't just seem a little embarrassed - her face is positively glowing with heat. Especially when she spoke the last few words, I could see her eyes darting back and forth and her cheeks reddening! I'm wondering to myself what could possible make this girl - the girl who set my blood pumping simply by licking jam off her fingers - feel embarrassed about simply asking a question about sex. I can't help but feeling that she's got something on her mind - something truly raunchy - and whatever it is I want to know about it.

"Pretty much. I mean I haven't tried everything, so maybe there are some things I wouldn't like. But yeah, I'm willing to try just about anything."

I infusing my words with confidence, but can't help but blush a little. It's one thing to joke around with my friends that I'd do anything - short of two guys. But exposing myself like this, in private conversation with a girl whom I'm really attracted to, and really laying my feelings bare is something else entirely. It makes me excited though, knowing that I really would be up for all kinds of kinky things with her. And it makes me hope that it excites her as well. Maya still has that slightly thoughtful look on her face, and although her eyes have regained their usual boldness, she still has that red tinge to her face. I find myself hoping more and more that she's not just blushing from embarrassment, but that a part of it is her thinking about me the way I'm thinking about her. So I decide that it's time to throw the dice, and let the lords of fate rule.

"Why do you ask? Got something in mind?"

Not my most subtle move, but it's all I could think of. And it made her break eye contact and look down (again!), so I figure I'm on the right track and that it's time to press my luck.

"Come on! You tell me what you're thinking and I'll tell you what I'm thinking." 

I try to exude trustworthiness and serve up a solemn vow.

"I promise! Pinky-swear!"

She laughs and smiles - splitting her face into one of those grins you never want to forget.

She gives a little bow, and replies in a solemn voice:

"I do not doubt your word Sir, but you see..." and now she turns from solemn to uppity "...I already know what you're thinking."

Ignoring her jab I attempt a return:

"Sir eh? I could get used to that. You should call me Sir Matrim. Sir Matrim the..."

Taking my hesitation as her cue, Maya pipes up with her suggestions:

"Sir Matrim the Buffoon? Sir Matrim the Pale?"

"HEY! That's a low blow missy: I can't help my complexion. And, for the record, fine pale skin used to be a sign of wealth and prosperity. If I went back in time people would not only be calling me 'Sir', they'd bowing left right and center."

"Missy? If I'm going to call you Sir, you should be calling me Mistress."

"You'd like that, eh? I bet you'd enjoy being called Mistress way more than I'd like being called Sir. I'm sure that having a few strapping young servants working round the clock to please their Mistress would be just to your taste."

"Oh please. Like you'd say no to having a set of nubile girls at your beck and call."

Not having a good comeback, I settled for honesty:

"Actually, while I think it's a nice fantasy, I'd probably worry about the morality of having real servants. To say nothing of sex-slaves or something like that. It's just so far removed from my life. I mean you're right in that it'd be nice not having to do anything-"

"And having hot ladies willing to 'rub you the right way' with their every appendage and orifice would just be a bonus?" Maya interjects with a mischievous look on her face. The image intrudes upon my mind. Sexy young bodies, ranging from lightly clothed to stark naked, waiting to be ravaged by me whenever I feel like it...

"Like I said, it's a nice fantasy."

A really nice fantasy. I'm glad there's not too much light, for if Maya looked at my crotch she'd see the suggestive outline of a semi-erect penis.

"But you know what they say. A bird in hand is better than ten on the roof."

Maya raises her eyebrow at that. Might have been a bit presumptuous of me. Just a tad.

"So you've got a bird in hand, is that what you're saying? I think I liked you better when you showed me some respect and called me Mistress."

The way she talked and held herself - voice overflowing with indignation, her puffed up posture - made it seem like she was offended, but her eyes...it's as if they're trying to tell me something.

"No no no. I'm not saying that at all. Purely hypothetically speaking. If I had a bird in my hand I wouldn't go chasing after the birds on the roof. Mistress."

There. That ought to appease her, I thought to myself. And apparently it did, because her shoulders relaxed, and her nose stopped pointing skyward.

"I like the way you said that."

"You like the way I said what?"

"The way you said Mistress. With respect. And a touch of submissiveness." Submissive? Me?

"Say it again. Say I'm your Mistress."

She wants submissive? Huh. I can be submissive, for a good cause. Kind of. Up until this point I haven't really been paying attention to where we are or where we're going, but we're walking by one of those old low brick fences, on the edge of a public park. A spark of inspiration strikes me - I'll show her my special brand of meekness and respect. Before she even realizes what's happening, I grab her by the waist and hoist her up on the fence. Sitting on the fence puts her above me, and I'm looking up into her surprised face.

"You, Maya, are my Mistress. My beautiful and clever Mistress. Your words are my command!"

I'm still holding onto her waist and I'm leaning into her. I've never been this close to her before. I can see her chest rising and falling as she breathes. I can see the cute little dimples by her mouth, and I'm treated to a spectacular view of her full lips. She's looking at me quizzically, as if though she's considering something quite serious.

"You shouldn't joke about things like that. Someone might believe you."

I want her to take me seriously, so I say:

"I'm not joking. I'll call you Mistress if you like that kind of thing."

Suddenly she makes to get down off the fence, but I'm in the way, making her bounce back. She sighs at me, and she doesn't look serious anymore, or curious, she just looks annoyed.

"This is why I don't bother: everyone just thinks it some weird 'thing'. Ruth doesn't say anything but I knows she thinks it's odd. And Simon is downright rude about it."

She stopped trying to get off the fence, and now she's just staring into nothingness. Feeling a little misunderstood myself, I say with feel and gusto:

"I don't think it's weird. I just admitted to you that I fantasise about having my own little harem. And I definitely dream about having someone who's willing to do my bidding from time to time. So I don't think it's weird at all."

Sensing that she still doesn't quite grok what I'm trying to say, I continue in a more subdued manner.

"What's more I..."

That caught her attention:

"Yes?"

"...I think it's hot."

The words are tumbling out of my mouth now, I can't help it.

"I think you're hot. Like really really hot. And I think you deserve a little worship. From me, specifically. As much as you want. Just standing here close to you like this makes me want to give you all the attention in the world. In fact, I am giving you all my attention right now: I wouldn't have noticed if someone was being stabbed at a stone's throw away. I'm drunk on you and your... everything and I'm being super serious when I say that I want to share in whatever fantasies you have. Mistress."

I adopted a (hopefully) pleading pose halfway through my rambling, and it seemed to have had a positive effect, because the curious look is back. And so is the smile. 

"You really mean that don't you? That was the nicest thing someone has said to me all year, you have no idea how it is to have people scorn you because you like something different."
