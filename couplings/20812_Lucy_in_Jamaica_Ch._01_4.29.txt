 "Would you like something to drink, or a snack?"

The attractive blonde stewardess was leaning over and smiling sweetly.

"No thanks" said Lucy. She glanced over at her husband Ian in the window seat. He was asleep -- or pretending to be. Sod him.

"On second thoughts I'll have a Bacardi and coke -- actually make that a double. And some peanuts". What the hell, I'm on holiday, she thought.

Ian would not approve of the peanuts; lately he had been making less than subtle comments about her figure. She had been furious with him two nights ago when, in front of all their friends, at Joanna's party, he had said she was putting on weight. She still hadn't forgiven him for the humiliation and things between them had been frosty. And talk about pots calling kettles...

They were flying to Ocho Rios, Jamaica -- a treat for her 40th birthday, But Ian was also going to meet up with some old colleagues who were there on business. She just hoped he wasn't going to ignore her like he usually did when he was with his mates.

Two Bacardi's later she was feeling a bit mellower. At least I'll have the pool, my Ipod and the all-inclusive bar. I'll survive. She lay back in her seat and drifted off to sleep.
