 Chapter 02: Karen

Mel and I had slept together about once a week since the night she'd signed off on my membership in Sigma Eps' boytoy corps. This was the third week since it happened, and although we'd talked about it, I hadn't been contacted for my next "test".   

It didn't really bother me. Nice as it might have been to be part of a group that got to fuck the lust-crazed sisters of Sigma Eps, I was grateful for Mel's presence in my bed, and I saw little point in being pushy.

She woke me that morning with a kiss. I cracked open one eye to see that she was already dressed in her usual painted-on jeans and a crop-top. She grinned and kissed me again. "I'm off, lover. I'll talk to you later today, or maybe tonight."

I grunted out a goodbye, my voice thick with sleep, and fell back as she let herself out.

Fifteen minutes later, the alarm went off. I called down the wrath of Heaven on the infernal machine, but got out of bed and grabbed a quick shower. Ten minutes later, feeling a bit more human, I got dressed and grabbed my books, thinking to grab some breakfast at the Student Union before my first class.

It was while I was unenthusiastically consuming the alleged Western omelet on my plate that I noticed a piece of paper poking from between the pages of my History book. I pulled it out and found that it was a small envelope, and inside it was a folded piece of paper.
