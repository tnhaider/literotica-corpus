 Note: Thanks to all the readers who provided feedback on the Crash-n-Burn series. There was some good, constructive criticism there, and I have been listening. I probably should say that I'm sorry for the way it ended, with so many loose threads (but, to be honest, I'm not really). Some of them will be picked up in the future, but that story was about Cole and Estelle getting together. As in life, sometimes the end of a chapter isn't tidy and clean.

I expect that this will be a slightly shorter series, but I'm not sure how many chapters it will end up being. I find that my writing sometimes takes me places I never expected -- and this first chapter of Masie's is no exception. Cole's story was mostly written when the first chapter was published. This is his mother's story, and I'll be publishing as each chapter is finished. I apologize ahead of time if that makes some of you crazy with anticipation, but those complaints are some of the best compliments a writer can receive. I hope, as Maisie tells her story, some of Cole's tale makes a bit more sense. Some of the details will vary, because this is how she remembers it.
