 Do not reprint this work on any other website, or any medium, without the express consent of the author (me!).

Author's note: This story is a sequel to an earlier submission I wrote, "My Girlfriend's Rival". Although it can mostly be read on its own, the characters, their motivations, and past actions are all tied in with the first story. For full effect, I would recommend reading the other story first, but of course it's your choice!

I hope this sequel is both true enough to the original as well as different enough to warrant being written. I hope you enjoy it; comments are always appreciated.

Synopsis: In the previous story, Monica (the temptress) had finally seduced the reluctant boyfriend to sleep with her. In doing so, she insinuated that she would attempt to do the same to his jealous girlfriend. This story picks up right where the last one leaves off (with the couple leaving the party), and takes place from the girlfriend's point of view.
