 Author's Note: As always, I am taking creative license with noble and royal titles and Austrian geography. Took a few days off writing for the Thanksgiving holiday so I hope everyone is still interested in the storyline. For those that have read some of my other stories, I have incorporated a few characters from those previous tales. I hope you enjoy the crossover!

Wagner 1 touched down at Detroit Metro Airport at noon that day and was met by two bulletproof limousines flanked by a pair of blue Michigan State Police cruisers. Gunther had arrived before the nobles and their entourage and set up the police escort for the Count's road trip to his hometown of Gravel City and his meeting with the people Luke had entrusted with his financial and legal well-being. After the attempt on his life and subsequent wounding of his girlfriend, the Baronetess Sophia Lehner, in New York, Luke was taking no chances with his or his group's safety. The police escort would encompass the entire 45-minute trip to Gravel City and the aforementioned meeting at Anderson and Sons Law firm then to his father's home, now his home after the inheritance had completed.

Fifteen minutes out of the airport, the limousine carrying Luke, Sophia, and their maid/traveling butler, the blonde bombshell Anna, was speeding down I-94 when Luke's cellphone chimed his alma mater's fight song. He had received a text message from his good friend, Erik Decker:

 Hey, man! Are we still
