 Ms. Small

Someone kicked Robert Crane under the table. He snapped out of his trip down Memory Lane and looked around the restaurant table. The eleven people, including himself, were neighbors and this was the first outing of their newly formed dinner club.

He had been recalling special times he'd had with some of them, such as Roxanne and Brad Bullock on his right, his fuck buddies because the husband liked to watch his wife having sex with Robert. She hadn't kicked him because she and Brad were engaged in conversation with Darrell and Maude Burke on their other side. Nor was it Kara Brown across the table from Robert because she was too far away. She and her hubby, Don, were his movie stars because they liked him to video them having sex, after which she usually gave Robert oral relief.

Next to Kara was Robert's wife, Joan, talking to Kara. The two had become good friends, although the film business was kept secret from the Mrs. So, she hadn't kicked her husband.

"That was me," Peg Small, on his left, admitted. "You were staring off into space."

"Just reminiscing about my relationships with some of these people and how we got . . ."

"Involved?" Peg filled in for him when he seemed to be searching for a word.

"Involved?" Robert would have taken that word as a sexual connotation, and however accurate it might be, she couldn't have known thatâ€”unless she was referring to her relationship with him.

"You know what I mean. Your connection, your association."

"Yeah. I got it." He didn't read anything into her correction.

"What about ours? Do you remember that?"

Of course, he did.
