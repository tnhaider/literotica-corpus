 Fear had her frozen in that particular spot as the car sped towards her. A jolt of adrenaline had her stumbling back; her foot caught the edge of the gutter and she fell against the pavement as the car roared past, as it sped down the street. Her whole body trembled in fear as she watched the tail lights of the car that had tried to run her down now disappear around the corner. 

The darkness of the night swallowing her as the only light came from a single street lamp across the road. She picked her bag up and a piece of paper fluttered from it, she scraped it up from the ground and found that it was the directions Nick had given her to his apartment. She couldn't call him, he'd come to her rescue. She didn't want him to injure himself to help her; shakily she got up off the ground, her palms and arms burned from the concrete grazes.

She stumbled slightly as her legs felt like jelly, the adrenaline withdrawal leaving her unsteady and lightheaded, as she hurried across the road towards her car. She needed to get to Nick; right now it was the only place she wanted to be.

***

Nicola cursed as she travelled down the road, she missed that fucking slut; she escaped her wrath for now, but she would come back for her. She needed a better plan, but for now, she needed to get back to the station before they contacted Nick.

***

Nick lay back in his large leather chair as the news report flickered on in front of him, not really taking any of it in as his mind wandered to Evelyn. Heat flooded his body remembering every touch of her fingers and the hot press of her breasts as they rubbed against his chest. He groaned as his cock stiffened. Then images of what he would do to her tonight filtered through his mind making him groan again, making him adjust himself.

His thoughts were broken when the doorbell buzzed, he looked up at the clock noting it was only 6:30. Puzzled, he got up off his chair, unlocked the door and opened it. "Evelyn? What's wrong?"

"I almost got run over!" Evelyn clutched the doorframe hard as her arms visibly trembled. 

"Hey, come inside, sit down, we'll talk," Nick grasped her arms and led her inside. He shut the door and sat her down on the sofa, turning off the TV. "What happened?"

"I... just closed up the salon when I went to cross the road, this... car... pulled out and raced towards me, it only missed me because I fell backwards onto the footpath."

"Did you see what type of car it was?" asked Nick worried.

"No... it was too dark to see anything, but I do know it was a woman, the shape I saw in the car wasn't large enough to be a man."

"I'm taking you to the police station, you need to file a report."

"They won't be able to do anything, I only saw the outline of the woman. All I know is that she had red hair, but everything else was obscured." 

"You still need to report this Evelyn, you could have been seriously hurt," said Nick. He gathered her up in his arms and hugged her.

"Your shoulder Nick," said Evelyn as she was burrowed against his shoulder.

"It's fine, I'll take you down to the police station," said Nick with a bit of iron in his voice. 

Evelyn sighed, she knew that he wasn't going to let it go, "Fine, but I will be driving, you can't exert your shoulder."

"Evelyn, listen to me, you're in no state to drive. I don't know how you managed to get here in the first place. You should have called me; I would have come to get you."

"Stubborn man, I didn't call you because of your injury."

"We're both looking out for each other then, besides I can handle it, I'm worried about you."

"Don't worry about me, the shock has passed. Give me your keys before you hurt yourself," Evelyn demanded.

Nick sighed them grumbled, "Fine, but when I get you back here..."

Evelyn shivered at the promise in his voice as he reached into his pocket and pulled out his keys.

"Thank you, it will be fun to see what you have planned for me," said Evelyn, she then looked up at him and kissed his lips.

"Let's go Evelyn, the sooner we get this done, the sooner we can get to other stuff. How does pizza sound?" asked Nick with a grin.

Evelyn chuckled, Nick's grin was adorable, and she couldn't help but feel better seeing him smile. She knew she was being stubborn about it, she clenched down on the tremors still flooding through her body. He was going to hurt himself if she let him drive.

"I'll be here for you Evelyn," said Nick as they stepped up to the doors of the police station. He took hold of her hand and pushed open the door.

"Thanks, I still don't think this will help at all."

"The police will at least have something on record then, besides I know most of the cops that work in this area," said Nick, pulling Evelyn into a hug and kissed her forehead.

They stepped forward into the police station and walked towards the front counter. "Hey Craig." 

"Hey Nick, what have you done to yourself?" Craig gestured to the shoulder brace.

"Had an accident on a fire scene, got a dislocation, but my gorgeous girlfriend here is a masseuse. Hey, I'm here because we have a report to file," Nick gestured to Evelyn to continue.

"I was leaving work and someone almost hit me with their car. They came up over the curb and..."

"Right, come this way so we can get the paperwork done," said Craig as he got up from his chair. 

Nick grasped Evelyn's arm and led her down the hall towards the interview room where Craig had opened the door and was waiting for them.

"Craig is a great guy. He's a really good cop and takes his job seriously," said Nick as he led Evelyn into the room. 

Once they had sat down Craig started the recorder, "Officer Craig Stafford taking a witness statement at 6:57pm."

Nick rubbed Evelyn's arm soothingly as Craig began, "Please state your name for the record."

"Evelyn Lassiteur,"

"You said that someone almost hit you when you were leaving work correct?" 

"Yes, I had just stepped off the sidewalk to get to my car across the street when it happened. She pulled out from the side of the road and tried to hit me."

"Can you describe her?"

"I couldn't see much at all, but the car was a dark blue sedan The woman looked like she had long red hair; I saw a glimpse of it as she passed the streetlamp."

Nick curled his arm around her waist and soothingly stroked her ribs, pressing a kiss to her cheek. 

"I'll put this on the file, but there isn't anything we can do about it unless we get more information on the car or the driver." Craig reached over to turn off the recorder. 

"Thanks for your time bro, I know things can get a bit crazy around here at times," said Nick.

"Yeah, it's been a bit busy, don't know why but it always seems to this time of year. Steven and Damian have been working on a major case lately so we haven't had much free time together."

"It's been quieter on our front, and that's fine with me, since I did just get a gorgeous girlfriend," said Nick as he leaned over Evelyn and kissed her softly. 

Craig grinned and said, "We always knew you'd be like this when you got yourself a woman."

"Yeah, well, we're going to go and grab some dinner," said Nick and smiled at Evelyn.

"Have fun, I'll give you a call when we're not as busy so we can get together," said Craig.

Nick grinned and said, "Sure, see you around Craig." He grasped Evelyn's hand and led her out of the station. 

"We at least have something on record in case it happens to someone else. It's crazy how people can be so careless when they're driving. I'll take you to this awesome place I know, we can get takeout and go back to my place."

"Thanks Nick, for being there, I wouldn't have done it otherwise, I feel a little better now," said Evelyn, she then reached up and kissed his cheek.

"My pleasure, now what kind of pizza do you like?" asked Nick as he tried to not imagine Evelyn covered with pizza topping and him eating it off her.

"Meat lovers, I love barbeque sauce," said Evelyn with a groan as she licked her lips.

Nick forced back his own groan that rose in his throat, a new image of him pepperoni off her rose in his mind. He stumbled over the sidewalk as they reached his car, "I'm still driving Nick," Evelyn called as she reached the driver's door.

Nick watched Evelyn as she walked towards his apartment door, her graceful curves, and the way her hips swayed as she walked made him drool. It had only been 24 hours but he was already deeply enamored with her. Like his personal happiness was directly tied into if Evelyn was with him or not, which. sent a wave of self-conscious doubt swimming through him, what if she didn't feel the same way as him.

What if she didn't feel the same intensity, the same magnetic pull that he experienced with her. He didn't think he'd survive a rejection from her. He already felt fiercely protective of her, he wanted to make her his as soon as possible. But he had to wait; he didn't want to scare her off with the intensity of his feelings for her.

"Mmm, I can't wait to try this pizza Nick, it smells delicious," she said.

Nick groaned softly, he still couldn't get the thought of her wearing the pizza out of his mind. "They're the best," he said. He was embarrassed, his face flushed, he couldn't help but think dirty thoughts right now. Evelyn kept his body charged, especially with what she'd done earlier in the day, his body still shivered with the thought of what her practiced fingers really could do.

Nick reached the door and grabbed the keys out of his pocket unlocked it stepping inside and held the door open for Evelyn to carry the boxes inside. 

Once he sat them out on the kitchen table, he said, "Do you want mushroom, potato and bacon or the beef, tomato and onion?"

"I'll have three slices of the beef one Nick, I love lots of sauce on my pizza," said Evelyn.

Nick groaned, even with Evelyn being innocent, he couldn't help but think of doing naughty things with her. If he survived dinner it would be a miracle, he thought as he pulled out plates and set the pizza on it. "This is my favorite place to get pizza, I don't have it very often though, it's really quite fattening and I have to work out a lot to burn it off," he said carrying the plates over to the table. Once he sat down with it, he picked up a piece dripping with rich tomato sauce and took a bite.

Evelyn sat still on her seat watching Nick eat his pizza, she groaned imagining what the sauce clinging to his chin would look like spread over his gorgeous chest. In an attempt to keep from thinking too much about the fantasy, she picked up the pizza and took a bite. "Mmm delicious Nick, best pizza I think I've ever tasted."

"I grew up with good food, my mother was a food nut. She tried everything and anything in her kitchen creations. I think it's part of the reason why dad bought the restaurant, it's one of the things that mom would have wanted."

Evelyn could feel his pain just from watching his eyes and forehead crease a little, the sad look in his eyes only lasted a moment before he continued eating. 

"She sounds like a wonderful woman."

"She was, it's why it was so hard on my father, but he encouraged me to go for the firefighter training a few years back," said Nick while he ate.

"That's great, was it always something you wanted to do?" she asked picking up her pizza.

"Yeah it was, I always wanted to do that; if it wasn't firefighting, I would have gone to the police academy." 

"I always wanted to help people too. That's why I became a certified massage therapist. I thought about being a nurse but that was too stressful. This way, I know I've helped people when they need it and it brings a great sense of achievement."

Nick grinned and said, "Yeah it's exactly the same for me. I want to help people, especially when they are in need. So, what do you like doing on your time off of work? I'm asking because my uncle has a horse ranch if you're interested in horseback riding?"

"I've never been to a horse ranch before, but I'd be willing to try it out. I usually just relax at home and read books on my time off. I haven't done anything outdoors like for a few years now, although I did go a camping trip as a graduation present from my parents," Evelyn picked up another piece of pizza from the box and started eating it.

"You'll love it out there, horses are amazing animals. My horse is a coal black stallion named Hades. He's a magnificent horse, really. I'd love to show him to you sometime." Nick too picked up his last piece of pizza and shoved into his mouth.

Evelyn giggled as she noted the sauce dripping from Nick's chin.

"What?" he asked as he finished eating.

"You have sauce all over your chin and your cheeks, I never took you for a messy eater," said Evelyn grinning.

Nick grinned broadly and said, "It's the only way to eat pizza though. When we're done, do want to watch a movie?"

"Sure, I'd love to just relax for a while. It's been a busy day."

After they both finished eating, Nick asked, "What kind of movies do you watch?" 

"Romantic movies, but I love a good suspense movie every now and then, you know, spy movies like James Bond."

"I have plenty of movies to choose from, even some romantic ones too. Take your pick, they're in the cabinet in the living room. I'll just clean this sauce off."

# # #

Evelyn rested her head against Nick's chest as she watched the movie, she loved James Bond movies; she owned every single one of them. Nick was like a warm blanket to her as he had his arm over her cushioning her against his solid bulk. She could get used to this, she thought feeling the steady beat of his heart against her.

"I'm glad you're a Bond fan," said Nick looking down at her. 

"Of course, I grew up watching them. My father loves them, and so do I, it was father-daughter bonding time when we watched the movies."

Nick leaned down and kissed her softly, "That's nice, are you close with your parents?" 

"Yes, I see them at Christmas, they live in Arizona though."

"I'd like to meet them," Nick pulled Evelyn closer, wrapping his arms around her more tightly.

"Mom would love you," Evelyn then reached up and kissed him softly.

They sat in each others' arms and watched the rest of the movie in silence, simply enjoying each other's company.

***

Evelyn yawned as the movie credits rolled across the screen, "Let's get you into bed, it's been a rough day."

"Mmm, haven't had a shower yet," she said as she yawned again.

"Shower in the morning, time to get you into bed," said Nick as he turned off the TV, "A shower will only wake you up and you need to get some rest."

"Ok, shower in the morning," Nick helped her up off the couch, and took her up to his bedroom. 

"I'll help you take off the brace Nick," Evelyn watched him trying to remove the straps. She opened the clips that held the brace in place and slid it off his shoulder. She giggled as Nick tried to pull his shirt off with one hand.

"Let me get that for you," Evelyn giggled again, pulling off his shirt. His bronzed, rippled chest would always make her breath catch as he unbuttoned his pants and slid them off. 

Quickly, Evelyn pulled off her shirt and pants, and blushed when she realized she hadn't worn any underwear today, expecting to get changed at home. Nick's eyes drank in the sight of her as he pulled back the covers. "We both need to get some sleep Evelyn. It's been a rough day for us. We'll have plenty of time to play in the morning."

"Yeah, it has been quite a day," said Evelyn as she slipped into bed. 

Nick kissed her forehead before reaching over to the lamp and switching it off. "Goodnight Evelyn, sleep well," he pulling her into a tight, warm embrace. 

She reveled in the feel of his muscles brushing against her back, and his warm scent curling around her. She leaned back against him and closed her eyes.

The sound of water falling woke Evelyn from her blissful slumber. She looked around to find the bathroom door slightly open, and licked her lips as she envisioned water rolling over Nick's muscles. She kicked back the covers and walked towards the door, pushing it open silently, and was greeted with the sight of Nick's back gleaming with soap suds flowing over his skin.

She crept towards the shower door and pulled it open, stepping inside, closing it behind her, "Started without me?"

Nick froze as Evelyn's voice charged over his body. He turned to face her, his arms snaking around her waist, "You looked so peaceful, I was going to make you breakfast when I was done in here."

"So how is your shoulder this morning?" she purred touching his shoulder.

A shiver raced through him, "Still sore, but its better than it was yesterday. The massage you gave really helped." 

"Let me help Nick, have you just started?"

He grasped her arm gently and said, "Yeah, I just got in."

"Well turn around stud, and I'll get your back for you." Evelyn grabbed the soapy sponge from his hand, his eyes glowed with desire.

He turned around and placed his hands against the wall, then Evelyn rubbed the sponge over his shoulders. Desire flooded his blood, knowing she was behind him was enough to get him painfully hard.

With careful strokes of the sponge, Evelyn washed his shoulders then rubbed down his back. She grinned to herself seeing his muscles lock and release, her movements deliberate yet erotic leading over his ass and thighs, "I don't want you exerting yourself too much yet Nick, your shoulder still needs at least another few days to heal." He groaned when she bent down to scrub his calves and feet, then dropping the sponge and working her soapy hands up his legs. "You're awfully tense, Nick," she teased, her tongue flicked out and licked the base of his spine. 

Evelyn grinned as the groan slipped out from his lips, her hands slid further up his thighs hastening his breathing. His legs trembled when she grasped his hard cock with both hands and began to rhythmically stroke him, rolling her thumbs over the head, her fingers over his shaft, tickling the top of his balls.

"Let me relax you, the looser you are the faster your shoulder will heal," she whispered and sucked on his tailbone as her hands continued to masterfully manipulate his throbbing manhood.

"You're... speaking from... medical experience?" Nick groaned as her fingers stroked and caressed him.

"Oh yes, relaxation is the best way to treat strains and sprains," Evelyn picked up the pace of her stroking.

Nick panted harshly, thrusting into her hands when her fingers slid over his balls. He groaned, his head rested against the wall, arms braced against the hard surface as tremors of pleasure washed through him.

Evelyn reveled in the mastery she had over his body, how he reacted to her physical manipulations. She would have never considered touching a man like this only a few short days ago. Something about him made her want to be adventurous, to be wild and daring.

"Relax Nick, let the tension out." She stroked him faster, rubbing her thumbs over the tip in a circular manner.

Nick moaned as the passionate fire boiled through his veins, with a shout he erupted in her devious hands. Ribbons of cum flooded the shower and the blinding pleasure robbed him of his strength. 

Evelyn groaned at the rush of power that sped through her as he came in her hands. "You can make breakfast while I finish up in here."

Nick turned to face her, still breathing hard, "Sure, how about an omelet and toast?" he asked with a dazed expression.

"That sounds delicious." Evelyn moved to the side of the shower and watched Nick step onto the bath mat, water dripping off his body. There was something about him that made her just want to ravish him, to love him. She almost did when he turned towards her and kissed her softly before grabbing a towel off the rack.
