 Tom's reputation continued to grow within the company, with surprisingly little jealousy among his coworkers. He wasn't the first guy to fuck his way through the staff, but the difference was that they came to him and none owned him. The other guys -- especially a particular senior person in a position far above his abilities -- played the "Oh yeah baby you're the only one for me" game with each in turn before moving on to their friends, which broke more than a few hearts, caused much discord, and ended some friendships. Tom didn't pretend to any kind of exclusivity. He loved women, all women, and they sensed that difference. Everyone was getting what they wanted out of things.

Except the other guys. They knew of his reputation and groused about it, especially since none of them were any longer getting any, but there wasn't one damn thing they could do about it.
