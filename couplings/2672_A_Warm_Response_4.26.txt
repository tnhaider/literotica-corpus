 Dedicated to Cat

I had been reading the stories from Literotica for a few weeks, since a girl I chat too online had referred me to it, knowing I shared her taste for everything erotic.  I read the stories and began to investigate the site.  What a little goldmine of thoughts and images, links and connections to take me into the mental world of the pleasures of the flesh.

I had always enjoyed erotica, and I had thought before that there were incidents in my life that I wanted to get down “on paper”.  Now that I was in my 40’s and spending more time thinking about good sex than getting it, I could enjoy the reminiscence on the gorgeous women I had experienced and who had experienced me when I was in my rapacious prime.

I decided to write the stories of the virgins I have broken in.  There is something so potent about taking a girl’s virginity, and after I had acquired a taste for the experience of giving a pretty girl her first experience of feeling a man’s hard lust inside her, I went out of my way to make sure that I would be able to take the full pleasure of as many cherries as I could pick.

Mandy was my first virgin.  Having read a lot of the “First Time” Literotica stories, I thought I would write it in chapters, building up through the experience chapter by chapter.  The first chapter came quickly and I submitted it without a lot of thought.  I was writing these stories for myself really, as the potency of my recollections was stronger than just reading another’s.

I logged into Literotica a few days later and, scanning the “New Stories” lists, I was really excited when I saw the name of my story and next to it a little red “H” - my first story was officially “Hot”.  This little ego boost had a great effect, particularly since the first chapter was pretty wordy without a lot of sex.  I busied myself earnestly to produce Chapter 2.

The same day I had submitted the second chapter.  Now I got into the whole thing of logging into Literotica every morning, anxious to see how many people were reading my story, feeling a little crushed when the voting on my first story started to waver until it was no longer “Hot”, and then feeling a blast of excitement when thousands of people read my second story.

The same day that I saw my second story had scored another red “H” I received my first feedback.  It was from a woman who signed herself as “Cat”.  “Wow! I really loved your stories! I haven’t had much sexual experience at all and I found myself reading your stories and wishing I had been Mandy.  I will be looking for more stories from you in future.”

This was a development I hadn’t really thought about.  Cat had listed her email addy, so I sent her back a little email saying thanks and asking her to give me as much feedback as she liked.  I guess everyone loves to talk about themselves, and now I had been bitten by the Literotica bug, I really was hungry for feedback to find out how I could appeal more to my audience.

I sent Cat an email thanking her for her feedback and telling her that I would be interested in entering into a correspondence to share ideas.  I had no idea how old she was, what she was like, I was just caught up by the spirit of the free exchange of nice ideas.  The odds of having someone seriously fuckable responding to my ramblings were realistically remote.

“Hey Bad Boy-

I've just recently found this site but your story is the one that sticks out in my mind. I'm kind of new to this too so let me know what I can do to help and I'll give it my best shot :-)

Cat”

She sounded really friendly, but I am only human.  I have met some gorgeous women in real life who I first spoke to online, and I was interested to know just who I was writing to in the context of sexual connection.  I asked her to tell me something about herself, age, location, attachments and whatever else she might normally put on a profile on a sex site.

“Hi Bobbie-

I saw your profile on the story site but since your shy about details, I'd love to know more about you. As for me, I'm kind of shy myself but here goes. My name is Cathy but most of my friends call me Cat. I live in California and turned 30 in February. I'm still single which drives my Grandmother crazy, and have no children. I have longish reddish-brown hair and hazel green eyes which my family tells me is from my Irish and Portuguese sides of the family. 

I have to admit that I'm not real sure what I like when it comes to sex. I'm kind of embarrassed to say that I don't have a whole lot of experience. I've had 1 sexual partner and I lost him a few years ago and haven't been with a man since then. I have dated several men since then but nobody that I felt comfortable enough sharing myself with. At least nothing more than some touching and kissing. I think that reading some of these stories on Literotica is helping me find out what kind of sex "turns me on". Does that sound funny? 

How's that for some initial information? I look forward to learning some more about you.

Cat”

Yum, yum, yum.  One of the great pleasures of my life is showing women new things to add to their sexual pleasure.  I love girls who love to fuck, but there is something succulent in the experience to be had with an older woman who has had little experience.  I love to hear those words, “I have never done anything like that before....” in the afterglow of a great fuck.

“Hi Bobbie-

In response to your questions, I'm 5'4", about 120 lbs, and my bra size is 34B. I've been told I'm attractive but I really don't date much. I had a bad sex experience when I was really young so that pretty much put me off of sex. My friend's tell me I'm gun shy.

Tell me about you? What do you look like? How did you get started writing erotica? “

I chose to believe her self-description.  Damn!  I had hit the jackpot.  Just the right age, just the right height, just the right weight and a very nice bra size - but most important of all she was opening up to me like a flower in the sun.  I had the feeling that I had found a woman who would appreciate and inspire my sexual imagination.  Then Cat suggested we chat.

After a few more technical exchanges about what messenger program to use, we were talking live online. It is hard to explain how chuffed I feel now, having done something unusual and learned to touchtype.  Touchtyping has allowed me to communicate more deeply with more people than at any other time of my life - all thanks to this amazing technology...

Cathy: I’m grandma sitting now so i have my laptop
Bobbie: so have you made yourself cum reading stories in the last  couple of days?
Cathy: I’ve had every intention of doing so, i printed your story so i could read it in bed but i was so tired i fell asleep
Bobbie: ha okay
Cathy: tonight i definitely will tho
Bobbie: is your grandma staying with you now?
Cathy: I’m at her house. my parents are on vacation this week so I’m staying with her. But she stays in her room all day and sleeps so basically I’m alone

Bobbie: how long were you fucking?
Cathy: since i was 24, same guy
Bobbie: well how many years was that?
Cathy: 4 years
Bobbie: is 44 too old for you in real life?
Cathy: no
Cathy: i think age is more how you live than how old you are physically
Bobbie: have you already thought about fucking me?
Cathy: honestly? yes
Cathy: when i first read the story
Bobbie: if I was in my car outside your door right now would you sneak me into your bed and lock the door?
Cathy: not yet, I’d have to know you more first
Cathy: I’d let you in for coffee tho...lol
Bobbie: how long did you know the guy who fucked you before you fucked him?
Cathy: about 2 months
Cathy: we're a weird story
Bobbie: haven't you ever had a fantasy about letting a complete stranger fuck you?
Cathy: yes i have
Cathy: but a fantasy and reality are different
Bobbie: do you like the idea of being dominated in bed?
Cathy: what do you mean by dominated?
Cathy: i like the man to be in charge. but no whips and chains stuff
Bobbie: yeah being physically dominated
Bobbie: did the guy you fucked make you cum a lot on his cock?
Cathy: yes he did
Cathy: many times
Bobbie: so okay
Bobbie: you are a  sensible girl online?
Cathy: I’m not sure what you mean
Bobbie: well no matter what fantasies you might share with a man online you would act sensibly in real life
Cathy: yes, exactly
Bobbie: that’s something I might try to get you to change your mind on
Bobbie: I love living out fantasies in real life
Cathy: you are more than welcome to try
Bobbie: how many cocks have you sucked?
Cathy: exactly 2
Bobbie: who was the other guy?
Cathy: see, told you i was inexperienced
Cathy: a boyfriend in college
Bobbie: did you blow him a lot?
Cathy: no, maybe 3 times 
Cathy: we weren't together for long, and then he moved 
Bobbie: have you got a vibe or a dildo?
Cathy: yes i do
Cathy: dildo
Bobbie: how long since you used it?
Cathy: last weekend
Cathy: i use my fingers more often, but sometimes need more
Bobbie: do you want to feel commitment from a guy before you will fuck him?
Cathy: not a commitment, but i want to feel comfortable with him first
Bobbie: did you think about me fucking you just like I fucked Mandy?
Cathy: yes, i was imagining it was me instead of Mandy
Bobbie: do you think you know how to use your cunt for a man’s pleasure?
Cathy: i think so
Cathy: i probably have more to learn, but i think i could pleasure just about any man
Bobbie: did the guy who fucked you talk to you while he fucked you?
Cathy: not at first, but about the 3rd or 4th time he did
Bobbie: well didn’t you fuck him hundreds of times in four years?
Cathy: just about
Cathy: but the first couple of times he didn’t say anything, then one time he did and it stuck
Bobbie: well did he talk to you about your cunt?
Cathy: he talked about us, his cock and my pussy
Cathy: about fucking and cumming
Bobbie: do you like the word "cunt"?
Cathy: i don't hear it often. I think if you were talking dirty to me I’d have to get used to it
Bobbie: do you like the idea of fucking a guy who has fucked over 500 women?
Cathy: yes, more experience. as long as i was the only 1 at the moment
Bobbie: you don’t like the idea of a threesome with a girl?
Cathy: not with a woman, with another man I’d consider it
Bobbie: do you like it in the ass?
Cathy: I’ve fantasized about it, the one time i tried it hurt too much so he stopped
Cathy: but now i wish we had
Bobbie: I would love to be the first man to cum in your ass
Cathy: would you be gentle?
Bobbie: to begin with
Cathy: good
Bobbie: so what are you wearing right now?
Cathy: denim shorts and a t shirt
Bobbie: panties and bra?
Cathy: black satin panties and a purple bra
Bobbie: do you have a nice robe?
Cathy: i have a short black satin one with leopard print trim
Cathy: and a long green fleece one for when its cold
Bobbie: is it cold now?
Cathy: no
Bobbie: would you like to get naked for me and put a robe on?
Cathy: sure 
Bobbie: cool

Bobbie: yeah
Bobbie: I love bare cunt
Cathy: sure, I’ll shave it tomorrow
Bobbie: do you like being eaten?
Cathy: yes i do
Bobbie: so in fantasyland do you like the idea of being subservient to a guy ?
Cathy: depends on your definition of subservient. I like the man to take charge in bed
Cathy: I’ll go to work a day without panties if he requests
Bobbie: have you done that?
Cathy: yes i have
Bobbie: did he fuck you that day?
Cathy: yes
Bobbie: did you live with him?
Cathy: yes i did
Bobbie: what was the most times he ever fucked you in one day?
Cathy: there were a couple days we never really got out of bed so I'm not exactly sure
Cathy: we'd fuck, then nap for a bit and then fuck again
Bobbie: do you think he was big?
Cathy: i thought so, since then I’ve learned he was average
Bobbie: how did you learn that?
Cathy: guys bragging
Bobbie: how big was the guy in college?
Cathy: or I’d chat with them online and they would say they're 8 inches
Bobbie: was he thick?
Cathy: the college guy was about 5 i think. about1 1/2 inches
Cathy: 1 1/2 inches thick
Cathy: big enough it made me gag
Bobbie: what positions do you like best?
Cathy: i like side by side and doggy
Cathy: i also like missionary so we could be face to face
Bobbie: did the guy like to show you different angles of penetration?
Cathy: he would surprise me. we'd be in one position and then he'd switch
Bobbie: who do you think about now when you get off?
Cathy: i think about the last guy, Rob
Bobbie: are you thinking about me now?
Cathy: yes i am
Bobbie: if you let me in for coffee now would you be feeling your cunt get hot and wet?
Cathy: yes, i already am
Bobbie: mmmmmmmm I wonder what you like best
Bobbie: the main reason I have had so much fun is that what I love most about sex is feeling the girl cum
Bobbie: I am gonna find out all about how I can make you cum
Cathy: i love feeling a man cum in me. I love the way he groans
Cathy: and the way his whole body gets tense
Bobbie: I have a really good true story about a girl in a robe opening the door and letting me in - I am going to write it soon
Cathy: really?
Bobbie: yeah
Cathy: i like that
Bobbie: the week after I fucked Mandy I fucked her best friend
Cathy: now I’m going to be looking for it
Cathy: was she as good as mandy?
Bobbie: yeah
Bobbie: sexy girls always have sexy girlfriends
Bobbie: she had a boyfriend but she was so horny from what Mandy told her about me she fucked me
Bobbie: but she had already been fucked
Cathy: was she a virgin?
Bobbie: no
Cathy: oh
Bobbie: I took her ass for the first time
Cathy: lol...you answered before i asked
Cathy: did she like it?
Bobbie: well it just wont go into my virgin series
Cathy: if you wrote about her virgin ass it would
Bobbie: yeah and I told her that if she didn’t keep fucking me I would tell Mandy
Bobbie: so I used to fuck her once a week
Cathy: what about her boyfriend?
Bobbie: but she was totally orgasmic
Bobbie: well she didn’t want him to find out either
Bobbie: he was a bit of a wimp
Cathy: how long did you fuck her?
Bobbie: about four months and then once in a while after that
Bobbie: mostly if a girl knows a guy can really make her cum and she is horny and lonely she will go fuck him
Bobbie: I was fucking Mandy and Heather and my girlfriend for three months
Cathy: didn't it make you tired?
Cathy: what did your girlfriend think? or did she know?
Bobbie: aw I have always had too much stamina for my own good
Bobbie: she didn’t know
Bobbie: when she found out we broke up
Cathy: how long ago was this?
Bobbie: long time ago
Bobbie: I was 21
Cathy: and many since then right? how many do you think?
Bobbie: if you let me in now would you be telling yourself we wouldn’t be fucking?
Bobbie: or would you be thinking it was gonna happen?
Bobbie: I have fucked about 500 girls
Cathy: i would be telling myself it wouldn't happen. but my body doesn't always listen to my head
Cathy: if i was as hot and wet as i am now, it would definitely happen
Bobbie: I am writing a story about another virgin who couldn’t stop once she let me kiss her
Bobbie: if I was there and I kissed you and you felt my hand going between your legs would you close them or spread them for me?
Cathy: spread them
Cathy: I’d be pulling you closer
Bobbie: would you take my cock out of my pants while I kissed you and fingered your cunt?
Cathy: yes i would
Bobbie: if I laid you back on the couch and put the knob of my cock into the hot lips of your cunt and pushed it into you before you had a chance to think would you be annoyed?
Bobbie: or would you love to feel your wet cunt stretching on my cock?
Cathy: no, I’d be more into the feeling of having your cock in me
Bobbie: mmmmmmm this is good
Bobbie: you are a find
Cathy: yes it is, I’m squirming in my seat
Bobbie: would you like to have your first orgasm with me?
Cathy: I’d love to
Bobbie: you want to plunge right into this and give me your phone number?
Cathy: i must warn you that i can be kind of loud
Bobbie: I love loud
Bobbie: will you wake up your grandma?
Cathy: hope not, I’d be so embarrassed
Bobbie: you want me to call?
Cathy: I’ll give you my cell number, but you can't call until i go to bed
Bobbie: when are you gonna go to bed?
Cathy: well, it's 8:45 now
Cathy: do you want me to go to bed soon?
Bobbie: its up to you
Bobbie: what’s your number?
Cathy: lol...i can't believe I’m doing this
Bobbie: well I might change your life
Cathy: ***-***-****
Cathy: its gonna be an international call tho
Bobbie: fine by me
Bobbie: I get cheap calls
Cathy: hope so
Cathy: i think the country code for the US is 001
Bobbie: yeah I know it
Cathy: lol... and how often have you done this?
Bobbie: so you want to go to bed now? or chat here for a while?
Cathy: lets chat for a bit longer. 
Cathy: once i log off I’ll check on grandma and then get ready for bed
Bobbie: okay
Bobbie: is it bad if I have done this before?
Cathy: no, I’m just curious
Bobbie: does it turn you on that I have fucked a lot of girls?
Cathy: yes it does 
Bobbie: well you will enjoy my stories
Cathy: how many stories in your virgin series?
Bobbie: 17 girls
Bobbie: but more stories I guess
Cathy: wow...lol
Cathy: I’ll be checking the site everyday for a new one
Bobbie: did your boyfriend ever tongue kiss your cunt like it was your mouth?
Cathy: yes he did
Cathy: made me crazy
Bobbie: yeah my tongue is the way I get virgins
Cathy: kissing them?
Bobbie: no tonguing their cunt
Bobbie: suckling their clit
Cathy: oh, i could see how that would get them
Bobbie: when a girl is cumming she will say yes to anything
Cathy: how do you get them to let you tongue them? or does it just kind of happen?
Bobbie: getting virgins just takes time and effort
Cathy: let your tongue do the talking
Bobbie: all girls want to get fucked 
Bobbie: what did you do about sex before you were 22?
