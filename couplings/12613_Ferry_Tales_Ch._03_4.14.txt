 The first of my ferry-tales narrated a long-ago experience, my sexual imitation of an innocent young man on his way to his wedding. The second ferry-tale relayed another sort of initiation, that of a middle-aged woman having sex for the first time with a transsexual. Now I'm going to try and represent a lesbian encounter, over a decade ago, between my friend, and occasional lover, Sabina, and a striking woman with an unusual name, interesting terminology, and sexual conduct at odds with her first impression.

The ferry in question, Newcastle-Bergen, is, like the Harwich-Hamburg service, discontinued. The opportunities for shipboard shenanigans are sadly much diminished
