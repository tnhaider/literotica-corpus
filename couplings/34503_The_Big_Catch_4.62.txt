 Author's note: This has been part of Literotica's inofficial Tag Team Competition and was written by Zeb_Carter and me. Zeb was so kind and allowed me to keep the story, but I need to make it abundantly clear that without him, the story would only be half as good. Thank you!

Story Note: This story takes place in an alternate reality, where there are no STD's, no AIDS and where sex is a joyful and happy experience. The authors have also taken literary license with some transportation destinations.
