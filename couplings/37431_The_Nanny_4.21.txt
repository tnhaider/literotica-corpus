I can't get Hayden to stop crying. Nothing works. The noise is ringing inside my head like a million tiny hammers, and for a moment I totally understand why mothers drive off their kids off bridges.

"Please, please stop crying," I beg. "I'm so tired. I don't understand what you want."

Hayden is still red-faced and screaming as hard as ever. I start to cry, too.

"Ms. Lavoie? Is everything okay?"

I look up from the crib. It's Hunter, and I look awful. Mascara is running down my face. I haven't washed my hair in four days. 

"Hunter, what are you doing here? Are you working today?"

"I just came by to pick up my check. You didn't answer the door, I figured you couldn't hear me with all the tear droplets."

"Your check. I'm sorry, I forgot. I'll get that for you."

I straighten my back and rub my eyes with the back of my hands.

"She hates me. She's been crying for hours. I don't know what I'm doing wrong."

"Mind if I try?"

"Please. She likes you better anyway."

"It just feels that way. You're her mother. She loves you."

"Ugh."

"Don't worry, I got it."

Hunter carefully plucks Hayden from her crib and rocks her in his arms. She murmurs dreamily into silence. I bury my face in my hands.

"I told you. She hates me." 

"You guys are just picking up on each other's stress. It's like a negative feedback loop."

"Fantastic."

"Listen. I've got the baby, you go do what you need to do. Shower, get something to eat, take a nap, whatever. We'll hang in here."

"No, I can't ask you to do that. It's Friday night. You have better things to do."

"Don't even worry about it. Now go take a bath or something. We're fine."

"Okay. I'll be quick."

"Don't rush. Really."

I raggedly push myself up and cross the nursery. I lean against the doorframe. 

"Seriously, thank you," I say. "You've been a lifesaver the past couple weeks. I didn't expect to be doing this alone, you know? And I really didn't expect to go back to work so soon."

"You're not alone. You've got me, for one."

"You know what I mean. Oh, and I'll add this to your next check."

"No way. Consider it a favor for a friend."

"Thank you."

I ease myself into a steaming hot bath, express my milk, and watch trashy reality shows on my tablet. I pour myself a big cup of red wine after I'm done pumping. I close my eyes and enjoy the relative quiet. I drift off to sleep.

I startle awake about forty minutes later. The bath is cold. I shiver. I dry off with a towel, wrap it around my body, and collapse face down on the bed. The sheets below me grow damp from my hair. Hunter knocks on the door.

"Come in..."

The door creaks opens. He tiptoes inside.

"Hayden's asleep."

"Thank you," I mumble. "You're amazing."

"Are you feeling better?"

"Yes, so much. I needed that."

"Good. I'm glad." He pauses. "Do you want a shoulder rub? You still look tense."

"No, you don't need to do that."

"I know I don't need to. I'm offering."

"I guess if you don't mind..."

Hunter leans over the bed and puts his strong hand on my back. 

"Just relax."

He rolls and kneads my shoulder muscles until every muscle goes limp. He massages my neck and presses against my scapula with his hand. He puts his knee up on the bed for leverage.

"Oh my God. Where did you learn to do that?" 

"Shhh..."

Hunter forcefully manipulates the arches of each foot. I moan softly. He rubs each leg vigorously with both hands, working his way up just past my knees. He carefully folds the towel back to reveal my upper thighs. I stiffen in embarrassment.

"What's the matter, Ms. Lavoie?" 

"My body is a trainwreck. And I think at this point you can call me Gwen."

"You are so hot. And you just had a baby. You should be nicer to yourself."

"That's easy for you to say. I bet everything is right where it's supposed be when you're naked."

"Well, I haven't had any complaints."

"I'm sure." I gasp. "Oh my God, right there. That's it."

"Close your eyes."

I slow down my breathing and try to stay in the moment. Hayden is still asleep. Hunter takes my hand and puts pressure on my palm with his thumbs. 

"Okay. I think I'm going to have to add this to your nanny duties."

"Only my favorite clients get this service, so don't tell on me."

"Never."

Hunter sits on the back of my legs. He caresses my thighs, digs the pads of his fingers in. He pulls back the rest of the towels and exposes my body. He massages my sides, my lower back, the top of my groin. He grinds his knuckles up and down my spine.

"Mmmm..."

Hunter lightly drags his fingertips all over my body. My nerve endings spark and tingle. He touches the soft skin of my inner thighs. I hold my breath. He kisses the back of my knees. The curve of my ass.

"Breathe, Gwen."

Hunter stuffs a pillow under my crotch. I cover my swollen breasts with my arms. He kisses my shoulder blade. He kisses the small of my back. He parts my legs. He kisses my pussy from behind. I sigh happily.

"Don't stop..."

Hunter licks the folds and lines of my labia and draws shapes around my clitoris with his tongue. I reach back toward him, and he pins my wrists above my head with one hand. I muffle my cries in the pillow so I don't wake the baby. I have a long, shuddering orgasm. Hunter holds me close. 

"Holy shit. I think the last time I felt this good was before I was pregnant."

"You were in pretty bad shape back there."

"Tell me about it."

"I didn't like seeing you like that." 

I roll over and kiss his forehead.

"You're sweet."

I sit up and wince. I grab my sore, aching breasts.

"Fuck, my tits are killing me. I hate breastfeeding."

He gently kisses my d√©colletage. 

"I know a massage for that, too."
