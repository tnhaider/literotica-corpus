 Standing in the kitchen cleaning up the dishes from dinner, I stare out the window daydreaming about the upcoming weekend. So lost in thought, I splash water down the front of my tank top. 

"Shit! This is why I need a dish washer!" I peel my tank top off, tossing it off to the side of the counter. In my haste to remove my tank top, I knocked over a glass.

"Mother--!" Thankfully the glass doesn't shatter, but rather breaks in four large pieces. I bend over to pick up the pieces. Fuming under my breath, I walk over to the trash to discard the cup's pieces. 

Cup pieces in hand, I don't hear you walk up behind me. 

"What's with all this noise? So much yelling for dishwashing." As you say these words, you grab my arms, causing me to drop the pieces and miss the garbage. You spin me around on my heels and pull me away from the now shattered cup. I put my face in your chest, breath in your scent, and then collapse into your arms. The over whelming feeling of anger, love, comfort, and exhaustion bombard my body when my bare skin touches you.

"What happened to your shirt?" 

"I splashed water on me. It felt gross clinging to me, so I took it off and tossed it to the side"

You laugh, "You should dress like this more often. No shirt, black bra, you're still in your gym shorts, which means you've got no panties on...."

I giggle at that last statement, knowing that it's true. You lean down and kiss me as I giggle, taking my breath away. I try to pull away to tell you that I need to clean up the mess I've made, but you won't let me go. Finally letting me go, I turn around and bend over to grab a broom from a lower cabinet. 

Bent at the waist, I feel my shorts being moved to the side by your fingers. The tips of your middle and index finger brush against my pussy, and a moan escapes from my lips. I stop trying to get the broom and hand myself over to you. You notice that I've braced myself on the counter, waiting for your next move, so you push your two fingers in slowly. Until your knuckles are flush with me. My legs go weak as I feel your hand press against my clit and your fingers feel around my pussy. 

You laugh again as you remove your fingers from my pussy. You lick them, knowing that this is not the last time this afternoon you'll be tasting me. I moan. I feel empty. I feel like I lost something. I've lost your fingers filling me. I am so upset, so unhappy. I want you to return to me. I don't want you to leave my pussy again. 

Laughing, you tug my shorts down around my ankles, exposing me to the cold air. The chill only heightens the fire I feel on my pussy, and moan louder for your to take me right there. I wiggle my ass in your face, trying to tease you. Enticing you. Instead of thrusting into me, you smack my ass. Hard. The sound echoes through the room, breaking the silence. I gasp. Realizing how much this has turned me on. 

"What do you think? My dick? My fingers? Or a few more smacks? ... I think you need to suck on my cock for a bit before anything else happens."

You pull me down to the floor and step back a few feet. I see your cock. It has created a tent in your boxers. I'm confused as to what's going on. 

"I thought you wanted me to..." 

You respond, with a smirk on your face, "Of course, but you need to come and get it. On. Your. Knees." 

A smile of pure lust spreads across my face. I start to move towards you with a hunger for your cock in my eyes. 

"Stop. Unhook your bra first. I wanna see your breasts swinging as you crawl."

I sit up to remove my bra and quickly resume my crawl to your cock. Breast swinging, the 10 foot crawl has driven me to the edge. I no longer want your dick, I NEED your dick. In one swift move, I manage to sit up, pull down your boxers and swallow your dick. A soft rush of air escapes your lips. You start thrusting in and out of my mouth. The house is silent, except for the sounds of your dick sliding in and out of my mouth. 

"Whatever you do, don't take your mouth off my cock." In response I look up at you and attempt to smile around your dick. You start to stand me up, grabbing me by my hips. I'm now bent in half with your cock shoved down my throat and ass up in the air. 

I look up at you confused. 

"Don't bite down. "**SMACK** **SMACK** **SMACK** **SMACK** **SMACK** **SMACK** **SMACK** **SMACK** 

I am confused. I am shocked. I am desperate for your dick in my pussy. The entire time you are smacking my ass, I am yelping on your cock. I don't let your dick out of my mouth, so I yell on it. 

After my eight smacks, you remove your cock from my mouth. A little river of pre-cum has formed on the tip and I lick it off quickly, not wanting to miss a drop. 

You instruct me, "Turn around, grab the counter." so I do. With my ass in the air, hands gripping the counter, and a wicked smile on my face, I wait for your next move. 

Sliding your cock in to me, I feel filled. You start pounding into to me. It's no wonder you wanted me to hold on to the counter. The feeling of you fucking me drives me over the edge. I start to cum after the 4th thrust. My legs give out, so I'm just held up by the counter and your cock. You reach around and grab at my breasts. Mashing them. Plying them. The orgasm ripples through me as you continue to thrust into me. 

As I come down, you spin me around and help me up on to the counter and begin again. My arms around your next, your face buried in my chest, my face buried in your neck. A giant ball of flesh fucking madly on the counter. Before you let me come again, you pull your cock out of my pussy. 

I let out an audible gasp. The sudden lack of you in me was shocking. You reach over to the drawer next us and dig around for a moment. 

"Mmmmm found it. " I noticed you pulled out my marble pestle. It's about 6 inches in length and 4 or 5 inches around. You tease my pussy with it. You use it to push some of my juices down to my ass. Finally you shove your cock into my asshole. Filling me. Once again making me yelp. After getting a rhythm going, you slide the pestle into my pussy. 

Two holes filled to the brim. I clamp down on everything, not sure which feeling I like more. Your cock thrusting in and out of me. The pestle matching your thrusts. I lean over and bite on your shoulder. I'm at a loss for words, being consumed by you rocking my world. I come a second time. The pestle falls out as I come all over it. You lick the pestle and then kiss me hard. 

I look you in the eyes and then slide down off the counter. I continue to kiss my way down. Your chin. Your neck. Shoulders. Chest. Stomach. Hips. Until finally I arrive at your cock. I look up at you with all the passion and heat in the world. I start licking your dick clean. Your fingers become weaved into my hair. Pushing and pulling my head up and down your dick. I want to make it sparkling clean. Taking your entire cock into my mouth and throat I devour you. 

You press my head into you. I can smell your scent. I can feel your cock filling me. Before I can get too comfortable though, your pull your dick out. Your dick is clean, covered in spit, but clean. 

Laughing you ask me to lay down on the kitchen floor. The cool linoleum sends shivers down my back. Leaning over me you enter my pussy again. Just thrusting into you sends me over the edge again and I come all over your cock. You begin thrusting again through my orgasm. My pussy clamping down on your dick. Not wanting to let it go. With a few more thrusts, you let out a loud animalistic grunt. You press into me one last time and come. Feeling your cum in me, I come again. With you. The heat between us has warmed up the floor, the linoleum no longer sending shivers through me. Now the only shiver inducing thing near me is you. 

You collapse on top of me. You slide yourself out of me and roll over next to me. I slide up next to you and put my head on your chest and breath in deeply. 

You whisper into my ear "You should do dishes like this more often." 

I laugh and sigh knowing that tonight's sex will have to try very hard to top this go around with you.
