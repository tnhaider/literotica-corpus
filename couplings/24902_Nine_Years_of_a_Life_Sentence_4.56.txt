 'Til death do us part. Those five little words. To some, they mean a life sentence only to be paroled through divorce. To others, something you suffer through because "parole" is the unthinkable...through better or worse...it has to get better, right? To me?...

I never really dated anyone in high school. I was just too awkward and dorky I guess. I did go to the prom with a friend, but that ended in a lost friendship that to this day, I don't understand. My wife and I graduated together and knew each other through mutual friends, but I can honestly say, I don't think either of us paid the other any attention let alone think we would we someday end up married.

It wasn't until college that we started dating. We ran into each other by chance one day in a computer lab. I felt a strange attraction to her. I can't explain it. Maybe it was just a familiar face in a strange new setting and it was comforting. Maybe it was something else. All I know is when I would see her, my day would somehow be better.

She was still dating a guy from high school who turned out to be a really jerk. Another friend and I would tease her constantly about him always asking if she had dumped him yet. The answer was always the same, "No, not yet." You can imagine our surprise when she came in one day and blurted out, "Well, I dumped him!"

And this is where it all began...

***The Beginning***

I was staying in the dorms at college, which was senseless since my parents lived so close, and she was commuting back and forth as it was a short drive for her. It started out as "just hanging out". I don't think either of us really considered it dating. But, whatever it was, I was happy. The more we hung out, went to each lunch, went to a movie, the more I couldn't wait to see her again. It was difficult to concentrate at school. We only really saw each other every other day because of our class schedules. And the weekends were worse. I would head home from school on the weekends hoping I would have a better chance of running in to her or that she would call, praying I could see her before Monday.

Occasionally we did do something on the weekend, but it happened all too rarely. One time, however, we did spend the weekend together. We went to visit a friend from high school. We stayed in the hotel above the bar where he was working. It was a small outdated room, but it was a room, a place to crash for the weekend. One night our friend was working late. We were both pretty tired and decided to turn in early. I was just drifting off to sleep when I heard her say, "I'm scared. I think I hear something scratch at the wall. Come over here with me." As I lay down beside her, she snuggled up to me. God what a great feeling that was! I could have stayed that way the rest of the weekend. Unfortunately, that didn't happen.

I don't really recall what happened the rest of the weekend. I do remember talking about relationships as well as other things. I just remember dropping her off at home and feeling as though I'd missed an opportunity of a lifetime; an opportunity to tell her how I felt. 

I think I avoided our usual meeting spot for a few days. I just couldn't bring myself to see her. The fear of it being awkward haunted me. I was relieved when we did bump into each other again. She was still talking to me. That was definitely a plus! We even made plans to hang out that weekend at a local festival. An even bigger plus! 

I don't recall if it was that particular weekend or not as we hung out quite a bit after that, but I do remember finally getting her alone again. This was my chance, my second chance. I don't remember how exactly we got on the subject, but relationships came up again. I got the feeling she wanted nothing to do with me, but I went for it any way. I said a lot of things that night that I never thought I would. Somehow, things took a turn for the better (at least as far as I was concerned). It started with just an innocent kiss, my first kiss. God how that felt so good. I could have done that all night long. Things started to heat up and it was soon followed by me kissing and caressing her breast...then a hand down her pants rubbing her sweet, tight pussy. Could it get any better? Apparently, it could. Not only did I get my first kiss that night, but the attention then got turned to me. There was a short struggle with my belt and jeans, but eventually my pant were down far enough she was able to start kissing and sucking on my cock. All I could think was is this really happening? She looked so sexy in the moonlight. Her lips wrapped around my cock, sucking, licking...The sensation was intense, like nothing I had ever felt before. I didn't want it to end, but I was too paranoid that we were going to get caught. The feeling of paranoia over took the feeling of sheer bliss and I was unable to finish. Eventually, things cooled down and with one last goodnight kiss, we went our separate ways. To this day, when we have oral sex, I flash on that night in the front seat of my car in the back parking lot of the mall and how great it was.

It was late when I got home. Or early. No matter, I still had to quietly sneak back to my bedroom at home without waking everyone. I tried to go to sleep that night, but I needed relief. I recalled the entire night over and over as I stroked myself to release. Still, there was too much going on in my head to sleep. Would she still hang out with me? Were we going to the next level in our relationship? Or was this another lost friendship? I needed to know! I finally convinced myself that I needed sleep. What if she called in the morning and wanted to hang out?...I didn't want to be tired because I couldn't sleep, right? Damn it, the sun was coming up, it was getting light out. I needed to sleep...

The weekend passed; no calls. Maybe I should have called. Oh well, it didn't matter. It was Sunday, I would hopefully see her the next day. Monday came and went. We must have somehow missed each other. Tuesday, our off day...damn it, I needed to see her, I needed to know where I stood! Wednesday, finally together! Together...and still talking! O.K., I haven't screwed this up yet...Plans? For a haunted house? O.K., what time? You want me to come home with you after class? Sure!

I don't remember when or where we ate, but I do remember for some reason being alone in her parent's living room. I was sitting on the couch watching T.V. She had left the room and when she returned, she walked over to me and straddling my lap started kissing me very passionately. Then the words I had longed to hear and never thought I would... "So, are you ready to be my boyfriend?" God YES!

***Silky Sexy***

I love lingerie. I love everything about it. The look of the lace next to my wife's skin. The feel of the silky fabric as we lay in each other arms. I just love it. To me, one of the sexiest things a wife can do for her husband is wear lingerie. To bed, under her clothes, it doesn't matter. I started buying it for her even before we were married. A cotton one here, a silky one there. I would look forward to her weekend visits before we were married. She would always were one for me, although it took some convincing...still does. She thinks she looks stupid, but that is as far from the truth as it gets! She looks so sexy! I often fantasize about my wife leaving the room and returning wearing one of those sexy little outfits I've bought her over the years. I fantasize about here coming into the room, dressed in lingerie, lips painted with deep, dark red lip gloss. And without saying a word, taking my cock out and give me the slowest, most sensual blowjob of a lifetime, those red lips leaving a ring around my cock.

One of my favorite pieces of lingerie is stockings. I'm not talking about pantyhose either. Thigh highs, the kind that stay up themselves. Or better yet, stockings, the kind that need a garter belt to hold them in place. There is just something about the look and feel of them that is different. I love how her legs look in them. I love to see her French pedicure peeking through the sheer silky fabric. I get rock hard just thinking about it. I absolutely love it when she wears her thigh highs in bed. The feel of the silky material against me when she wraps her legs around me as I kiss that sweet, sweet pussy sends me into sensory overload! I love the feel of the silky material rubbing against my skin. I almost cum instantly when we sit back as I'm taking her from behind and those stocking covered feet rub against my cock and balls...Instant bliss!

I can't get her to wear them nearly often enough. She does humor me, though. But it usually takes some begging on my part. Sometimes even an offer to help her "get ready". 

***The Anniversary***

Wednesday was a big day for us. It was our anniversary. Nine years. Could it really be nine years already? It seemed like only yesterday I married the love of my life. I couldn't wait to take my beautiful wife out for dinner and show her off. She had told me a few days earlier she wanted to get dressed up and it had my mind spinning. God, I loved when she got "dressed up". She didn't do it nearly enough. One of the biggest turn-ons for me is when my wife dressed up. I love seeing her in skirts. I love seeing her in special lingerie. I love seeing her wearing sexy stockings. I just love seeing her get dressed up! 

Suddenly, I had an idea. I had to act quickly for my idea to work, I had only three days. The first thing I needed to do was to get an appointment set up for her for a haircut and that sexy French pedicure I love so much. Next, I need some flowers and a card for her the morning of our anniversary. Finally, I had to convince her to wear something special. Ooh, and some sexy heels too...God she looks good in heels! I HAD to get her to buy some!... 

Now, what could I get her to wear? That black lace thong I love so much? That would be easy; she wears that all the time for me. Thigh highs? That shouldn't be a problem, but I'd rather see something else. 

Before we were married, one of the pieces of lingerie I bought her was a garter belt and stockings. At the time I was hoping I could get her to wear it a lot. She had worn it a few times to bed. And once, recently, she let me snap a few photographs of her in some sexy poses wearing them. Maybe I could get her to wear that special piece of lingerie under her skirt! God, I was getting hard just thinking about it. It was going to take some convincing...and some help...

I couldn't sleep the night before. I had visions of my sexy wife all dressed up for our anniversary running through my head and it had me very excited. So excited to the point that I knew I needed some relief. I couldn't help myself. I opened the pictures of her I had taken before and began to stroke my cock. I would bring myself right to the brink of relief, and then stop. I'm not sure how many times I did this, but I do know it didn't help matters. I went to bed late that night with an erection that just wouldn't go away. 

It was tough getting through the day at work. I just wanted to be with her. The anticipation of the day had me as excited as a kid on Christmas. Things were going as I had hoped. She had bought some sexy heels to wear with her cute plaid skirt. Her haircut and pedicure were done the night before. She loved the flower and card in the morning. I couldn't wait to take her to dinner. I had one last stop on the way home. It was a quick stop to get my hair cut. I hoped I would beat her home so I could help her get ready. We got home around the same time and headed for the shower. We quickly showered and I met her in the bedroom. I told her I had something special I wanted her to wear. She groaned and rolled her eyes. 

"Don't worry, I'll help," I told her. 

I carefully slid the silky stockings up her legs. 

As I fumbled with the clasps on the garter belt, she shook her head, "This isn't going to work. It's too short." 

"Let's just try it," I responded as I eased my favorite black thong up her legs. 

The skirt was just barely long enough to cover the tops of the stockings. With some situating of the skirt and a quick sit test to be sure no one but I got a free show and some reassurance, we went with it. My God she looked great! I couldn't believe it; she was actually going to wear this for me to dinner! God is she sexy! She finished getting ready and stepped into her heels. I wanted to take her right then and there, but hunger took over. It was a 45 minute drive to the restaurant and we were both starved. It would have to wait. The view going down the steps ahead of me would have to do for now.

The drive to the restaurant seemed to take forever. I would steal quick glances at her stocking covered legs. I tried to think of other things, but I was horny as hell and I knew what awaited me under that skirt!

We arrived at the restaurant and walked hand in hand in the rain. I would have dropped her off at the door, but then I would have missed the great view I had!

We were seated quickly and ordered our drinks. I got a quick peek at her stocking tops and garter straps as she slid into the seat and was instantly hard. The waitress was extremely slow. God how I wanted her to speed things up! I just wanted to get out of there and get my bride of nine years back home! The upside to the slowness though was I got to take in the view all that much longer. We chatted as we ate and I caught myself staring when she wasn't paying attention. Occasionally, I would reach under the table and rub her stocking clad foot and leg. I kept thinking how beautiful she was and how lucky I was to have her. 

Our original plan was to have dinner and catch a movie, but due to the slowness of the waitress, the movie was out of the question. That was fine with me. Unbeknownst to her, I had other plans for the ride home!

I paid the bill and as we left our seat; I again got an excellent view of her stockings! We made our way back to the car where I took a moment to steal a few kisses and a quick caress of her legs. Still, after nine years of marriage, I had to work up the courage to put my other plan in motion. I can never guess how she is going to react, but it is almost always the way I hope. I eventually worked up the courage to just throw it out there...

I love to watch my wife masturbate with her vibrator. The sound of her cumming gets me so worked up. We had a 45 minute drive back home and I wanted her to be ready for me when we got home. I think she was a little shocked, but extremely turned on when I asked her if she would play with herself on the way home. Not wanting to draw attention to ourselves in the parking lot, I started to pull out. 

"Where are we going?"

"I have a spot in mind."

There was an empty lot at a trail head about five minutes away and it was on the way home. I quickly pulled into the lot and turned off the lights.

"What are we doing?"

"You'll see," I replied as I leaned over and kissed her.

She passionately kissed be back as I ran my hand up her leg and under her skirt. I could feel the dampness in her panties, she was already worked up! As I reached behind the seat for my last surprise of the night, she stopped me.

"I want to fuck you...NOW! Let's get in the back seat!" 

"We can't," I replied. "We are too close to the main highway. Besides, I want you to make that pussy cum the whole way home. I want it dripping wet when we get there then I want to lick it clean!"

There was a little resistance as she just wanted to fuck right then and there, but eventually she gave in. I reached behind the seat a pulled out a towel for her to sit on and handed her the vibrator. She quickly removed her skirt and tossed it in the back seat along with her panties. Within seconds there was the familiar sound of her vibrator and subtle moans. I knew she was well on her way to her first orgasm of the night. I couldn't believe she was actually doing this! How was I going to drive home with an insanely sexy woman sitting next to me playing with her sweet pussy?!

That was one thing I didn't take into account when I planned this night. I was going to have to drive home. I just wanted to participate so badly! Thank God for rumble strips. I went off the road a few times trying to watch the scene beside me. I'm lucky someone didn't call us in as a potential D.U.I. I watched and listened until I couldn't take it any longer. 

"Let me taste you. Stick your fingers in you pussy and let me taste it."

She was more than willing to oblige getting her fingers coated with her cum then sticking them in my mouth. God she tasted good! I wanted more, but I had to get us home! At one point, I couldn't help myself. I turned on the reading light in the car to steal a quick look at her wet pussy and stocking covered legs. As I did, she reached another orgasm. The sight and sound was too much for me. I felt my cock jerk in my pants. Shit, did that really just happen? The sound of her cumming was enough to send me over the edge. Two spurts of cum shot out of my cock...Damn it, she just made me cum in my pants! I lost track of how many times she came before she turned her vibrator off.

"What are you doing?"

"I need to stop for a minute."

"But you're supposed to make you pussy cum the whole way home! You still have fifteen minutes until we are home."

She didn't argue. She went back to pleasuring herself and quickly reached another orgasm. As we reached a traffic light, the vibrator again went off.

"We're not home yet!"

"I know, I need to set up." She quickly adjusted the seat and was back at it.

As we approached town about five minutes from home, she just couldn't take it anymore. Again, the vibrator went silent, and so did she. I wasn't going to push her any more. Besides, she needed to rest. We were going to be home in five minutes.

As I pulled in the garage, I quickly shut the door behind us and shut off the car. I leaned over and kissed her passionately as I rubbed her sopping wet pussy. I couldn't wait any longer, but she had other ideas. She quickly released my cock from its constraints and started to lick and suck it. I was in heaven. But I wanted that pussy!

We raced up the stairs from the garage and headed for the bedroom. She stripped of what clothes she had left leaving the stockings and garter belt on. She hoped into bed as I removed my clothes. I quickly heard the familiar sound of her favorite vibrator. Within seconds she was cumming again. I laid down beside her a kissed and sucked gently on her breast as she played with her pussy. I sat back taking in the sight of my sexy wife making her pussy wetter than ever. Finally, I could watch! Her pussy was overflowing with her cum. I couldn't help myself, I need to taste it! I waited until she finished bring herself off one more time before I cleaned her up. There was so much and it tasted so good. I didn't want to stop, but she was on a mission, a mission to make herself cum. She gently nudged me out of the way as she went back to playing with herself. I continued to watch as she continued to bring herself to bigger and bigger orgasms.

"Baby, stick it in! Fuck me!"

The words I was waiting to her! The only thing better than fucking my wife or watching her play with her pussy is having my cock buried deep inside her when plays with herself. I love feeling that pussy cum on my cock!

We repositioned ourselves and I slowly slid my cock into her pussy. My God! That was the tightest and wettest her pussy had ever been! It felt so good! Before I could say anything, she started playing with her clit with the vibrator. I could feel the vibrations deep in her pussy from the vibrator. That, combined with the spasms of her overly excited pussy were about to send me over the edge. I didn't want her to stop, but I didn't want to cum yet either. I did what I could to hold out. She reached her peak again and her pussy started to cum on my cock. The sensation pushed me to the edge. I felt my balls tighten. I tried to fight it, but I couldn't. I jerked as a spurt of cum shot out. For the second time that night, I came...just a little.
