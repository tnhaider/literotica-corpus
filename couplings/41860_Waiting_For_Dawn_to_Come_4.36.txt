 "Typical," Ed moaned, pulling up his trousers and staggering to the ringing phone. On the TV, an extended tongue was paused on its way to a shaved pussy.

He picked up the phone and managed a reasonably polite 'hello'.

"Hi, Ed?"

A woman's voice he couldn't place.

"Yes?"

"Hi, it's Dawn."

Dawn from work? She had never phoned his house before.

"Hi, how you doing?" he said.

"Yeah, I'm good. How are you?"

"Well, you've interrupted me, actually — I was just about to have a wank."

She burst out laughing and Ed smiled, picturing her. Dawn was blonde, gorgeous and, of course, unavailable — just like his other attractive female friends. Not that he had a hope in Hell, anyway — he was always The Funny Friend. He had forgotten how to be anything else.

"No, I'm all right," he said. "Day off, so...just chilling out and stuff."

"You weren't really..."

"No!" he laughed, "I was actually making a cup of tea. So, is everything all right?"

"I'm locked out of the house."

Ed snorted.

"It's not funny!" Dawn said, but she was laughing. "I told John not to take the keys this morning, but he did, the idiot."

The boyfriend. Ed had seen him in photographs; he was a good-looking bastard.

"What about your neighbours?" he said.

"Nobody's in. Well, I think the Camerons are in, but no way am I sitting with them for four hours."

"So..."

"I was wondering..."

"You want to come over here and wait?"

"Oh, can I? Ed, that would be so great! You don't have company?"

"No, come right over."

"Oh, you're a star!" 

Ed blushed, as he always did with compliments.

"Number 58," he said.

"58, sure."

"How long will you be?"

"About five or ten minutes, I think; I'm in the car. Is that all right?"

Five or ten minutes! His place was nowhere near chick-ready.

"Yeah, great. See you in a bit," he said.

"Bye-ee!"

Ed put down the phone and glanced at his masturbation set-up in the living room. Driven by panic, he got to work.
