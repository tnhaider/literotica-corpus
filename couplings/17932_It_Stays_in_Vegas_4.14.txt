 The following story is based on actual events.



The flight from JFK to Vegas was more than five hours. First-class seating compensated for the long flight. Jenny ordered a martini, put on her headphones, and fell asleep to the sounds of smooth jazz. She woke up just in time to see the Vegas lights from 2000 feet above the city. Jenny was a seasoned traveler, but she was very excited about visiting Vegas for the first time.

With her luggage in tow, Jenny headed for the cab stand. As soon as the electronic doors opened, a wave of dry heat blasted her in the face. It was like standing in front of a pizza oven. It had been cool and rainy in New York for the past week; the heat felt great! The attendant blew his whistle and in seconds she was inside the cool air conditioning of a cab.

"I'm staying at the Bellagio," said Jenny.

"Your first time in Vegas?" asked the cabbie with a thick Pakistani accent. 

Jenny knew not to be na√Øve. "No, I grew up in Pahrump. But this is a business trip. I'm exhausted; can you turn on the radio?"

"Okay, the Strip is pretty quiet tonight. We should be there in 10 or 15 minutes," he said in a disappointed tone. He'd only earn $20 on this ride.
