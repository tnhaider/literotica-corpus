 I stand in the terminal shaking with anticipation. I really don't need this sign; I know what he looks like by heart. Shorter hair and a desert tan aren't going to throw me off.

Of course, I haven't seen Even in person in over two years, but his face is imprinted on my soul. He's the picture behind my eyelids right before sleep descends every night.

Flight 2274 from Georgia arrived ten minutes ago so it's a wait for him to get to where I am. I strain to see through the crowd that is always swarming McCarran International Airport. Among the hundreds of tourists set to spend all their money on the Las Vegas Strip is one man dressed in his dark blue service dress uniform. The inverted chevrons on his shoulders make me smile as he glances over the crowd to find me.

The sign I'm holding does its job as a fail-safe while my mouth goes dry and my vocal chords freeze. Instead of his name, he sees two CG characters with a heart around them. I pulled that screenshot from Warcrack a week ago. When you're trying to find someone with a common name like Evan, you come up with some creative solutions.

At the recognition of our characters, he makes a beeline for me barely saying "excuse me" as he nudges people out of his way. "Missed you Niesy," he whispers once he finds me and then closes his lips on mine.

There's a rule about public displays of affection in uniform in the UCMJ, but I figure, no one will care. My baby's back on this side of the ocean and in my arms. Someone will have to use a gun to stop me from returning this kiss.

I sink into him and caress the downy fuzz of his hair. After two years in the desert, he still tastes the same; he still smells the same; his instant hard on still grinds into my hip...

"Maybe we should get your bag," I gasp when it hits me that, if we don't stop ourselves, airport security will have to do it for us. Evan looks disappointed but nods his understanding.
