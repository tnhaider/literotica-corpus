 Chapter 1

Oh, by the way, let me introduce Ashley. Ashley is the daughter of multi-million Business Tycoon Fred Wonder. Ashley is such a beautiful girl, so much so that any man would give his all just to have her. She stands at 5'5with a spectacular body shape and booty that can make a man cum just by looking at it. Ashley's mum died when she was six-years-old, so she is all her dad has left. The thing about Ashley is she sees men as changeable tools.

She lives away from her father, and has three childhood friends she shares her apartment with: Tracy, Emerald and Sophie
