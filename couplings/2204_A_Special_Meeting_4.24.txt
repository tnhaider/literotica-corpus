 It's the end of another frantic and hectic day, and I'm glad to be leaving the day behind me. Breathing a sigh of relief, I head out to my car, and home. 

As I draw near to the car I notice a note stuck under the wiper blade. My first thought is that it's just some advertisement from a near-by local business, but as I get nearer, I see it's a sheet of notebook paper.
