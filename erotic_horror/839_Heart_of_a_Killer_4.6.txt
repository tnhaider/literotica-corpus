 Hi Litsters,

The inspiration for this story struck me out of the blue. This is my second go at Erotic Horror and I hope it does far better than the first effort. As always, leave your votes and comments on the way out.

DISCLAIMER -- This story is in the Erotic Horror category for good reason. What happens ahead is dark, twisted and will probably leave you a little bit queasy.

Thanks to my editor, NaokoSmith, whose hints that I may have gone soft with my silly humour stories have forced me to produce this and prove her wrong. She does some seriously amazing work with my terrible raw drafts. Also thanks to my beta reader KatieTay.

"And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door; And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon's that is dreaming, And the lamp-light o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor; And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor Shall be lifted -- nevermore! "

- The Raven, Edgar Allan Poe
