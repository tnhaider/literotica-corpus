 The Entity was old. It was older than the idea of names and therefore had none. It existed and that was all it cared about. It had been trapped in a place beyond places, but at last it was free. It had no knowledge of how it came to be free once more, but it cared not. That it was free again after countless eons was knowledge enough. 

It explored the new consciousness that it found itself inhabiting and discovered nothing. The being whose body it inhabited had no mind, no thoughts and no amount of prodding by the Entity could bring forth a response. 

The Entity explored the host body of the being and found memories and a physical form. It was a human male. Not the best for its purposes but it would do for now. The Entity initiated changes. Rearrangements began in the reproductive centers. 

The Entity accessed the memories and found much that it could use. However the host body was weak... too weak to be of much use. It needed to find a better host, one that was strong and vital. A female host would be best for its purposes. With a strong young female host it could begin. 

This body was torpid, its muscles unused. The eyes had received no impulses in the short memory of the body. Its muscles had not moved for what the memories said was a long time. But this "long time" was but a blink for the Entity. It could afford to wait. It gathered its strength and started to build the nerve connections and muscle mass that it would need to find a new host. 

The sack between its legs began to fill with seed. Seed that would contain the essence of the Entity. Seed that would be needed to secure a new host. 

Soon it would control this entire host and then it would begin. With a new host... a female one... nothing could stop it. The Spawning would begin.
