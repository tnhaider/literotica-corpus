 "Damnation!" 

Leander sucked in a breath and swore violently, yanking a frustrated hand through his extravagant hair. His pale, eerie eyes blazed, bespeaking the kinetic violence he habitually held in check. 

Lanka turned knowing eyes on her vexed friend, her high cheekbones painted almost ghoulishly by the wan glow of her own computer screen. They were the only two in the bunker-like computer lab, yet she responded within the private chambers of Leander's mind. You torture yourself, Leander – and over what? A pretty bauble, a weak-minded trifle.

Leander chose to speak, each word ground from his lips like glass beneath a boot heel. "You act as though you were not descended – plucked – from the same stock as she."

Mm... How many centuries ago? Lanka's arch response echoed lazily, sensually, through his mind's ear, the telepathy serving as an intentional and pointed reminder of how far removed from their human counterparts were the powers and sensibilities of vampires.  Interesting that you should use the term...stock. You refer to livestock, perhaps? 

Though Leander's snort was audible, he reverted to mind-speak with the ease born of long habit.  A high and mighty stance considering your own... sampling...of human pleasures. Your trysts are legendary.

Sampling, yes. I never desired one for a mate. 

No, Lanka, that desire was always reserved for me, Leander replied, not unkindly, the barest trace of regret tinging his thoughts.

The lambent green of Lanka's gaze flared as those entrancing orbs settled briefly on Leander, the pupils almost imperceptibly dilating as her mind fell abruptly silent. Wordless, she rose with offended grace, turned on her heel, and left her fellow immortal to his brooding.
