 Dizzy swarms of sleet sliced his face in a thousand, icy stars, obscuring Davin's sight. Had he passed the cabin? Pulling his jacket tighter, he heard it -- a discordant clatter of glae-whipped patio chimes. Boots crushed a path toward chaotic tinkling. Droplets of ice clung to his hair and eye-brows.

Under the thick layers, the toe of his Danner boots tripped an unseen root with a hollow thunk. Chopped wood scattered from his arms and Davin sprawled face-first into the snow bank like a broken angel. He crawled the last few paces to the awning.

Collapsing onto the thresh mat, his head thudded back against the door with a groan. Above him, candlelight flickered impossibly in the entry lanterns and he craned his neck. This wasn't the cabin. Where was he?

His vision blurred as the warm glow of lamplight enveloped him with warm immunity from the freezing storm. Involuntary shivers wracked his body and blackness won.
