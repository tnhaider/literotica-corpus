 Author's Note:

  If you've read "Thy Flesh, Consumed Part 1", and you're joining me again for the second part of this arc, "Thy Flesh, Consumed, Part II", welcome back. If you're joining me for the first time, I encourage you to read "Demon Flesh" and "Thy Flesh, Consumed, Part I" first. My thanks again to Ikema for asking more great questions and to everyone who's supported what I've come to affectionately call "The Il Malvagio Chronicles". 

 Enjoy! --EH
