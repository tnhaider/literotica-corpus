 The warm sea gently laps the storm tossed figure on the sand until it stirs; opens salt encrusted eyes; licks dry thirsty lips; lets go of the spar it is resolutely clutching; struggles to its knees and mentally offers a prayer to its deity. Later the shipwrecked sailor will wonder why his god has decided that he should be saved and all his shipmates on the caravel drowned, but for now all he can conceive of is an urgent need for water.

Gathering his strength he stands. Upright, he can see nothing but golden beach stretching away to left and right, backed by thick, menacing jungle.

Conscious of the weight of his wet sailcloth breeches and wool shirt, weakly he strips and wrings them between calloused fingers. Unclothed his vigorous and athletic body belies the white of his hair and beard, and a witness might well remark the size and robustness of his manhood peeking from its nest of luxuriant, curly hair.

His garments still damp, he dresses again and laboriously starts along the shore, the sand striking hot on the bare soles of his feet. His search soon becomes increasingly desperate. There is no gap in the jungle. No sign of any natives - though whether that is good or bad, given the shipboard tales of cannibals, he is unsure. But, more importantly, nor is there any sign of fresh water. Is he to be saved from the sea only to die a lingering death from thirst? To be on land yet cursed with "Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink".

Finally, staggering, he can go no further. He must rest. Seeking a modicum of shade under the foliage edging the beach he falls exhausted and soon sleeps.
