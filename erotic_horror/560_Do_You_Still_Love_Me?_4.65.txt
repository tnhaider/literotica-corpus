 "Do you still love me?" The voice was familiar. Slowly I turned towards it. "Do you still find me beautiful?"

Her knee length dress was torn and stained red from gushing wounds, rumpled and tattered on her form as she lay before me. Her limbs were twisted and mangled, jagged ends of broken bones protruded through her skin, stark white against the crimson flow around them. Her torn flesh dangled from rends unspeakably horrid. Long auburn hair matted with blood partially hid her disfigured face, small slivers of glass glinted on her cheek. Blood bubbled from the corner of her mouth as she spoke again.

"Do you still find me beautiful?"

I lowered my eyes, then bowed my head and answered meekly, "Yes. You are still the most beautiful woman I have ever known."

"Do you still love me?"

My gaze shot back to her swollen eyes, my voice boomed my indignity, "Have I not wept for you? Have I not poured out every tear I have for you? Have I not prayed and begged that cruel, spiteful, malicious god to send you back to me? Did I not sit by your side for all those months pleading for you to live while you lay dead to the world? And did I not set you free when your eyes begged it? That day... When I threw that switch... I tore my own heart out with it."

"Do you still love me?"

Hot, stinging tears rolled down my cheeks, my voice cracked on my reply, "Yes. Yes, I still love you."

"Kiss me."
