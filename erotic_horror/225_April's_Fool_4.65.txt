  This is my entry for the April Fools' competition. 

It is indeed an April Fools' story, but is also quite properly an Erotic Horror story, with the emphasis on horror versus eroticism. It involves non-consent, fear and both physical and sexual abuse. If that sort of fictional depiction bothers or offends you, or if you are bothered by dark tales, please read no further. There are lots of fun alternatives. 

Happy reading!
