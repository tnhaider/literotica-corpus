 When I came home from the hospital, recovering from a heart attack, I found my wife's wedding ring hanging from my neck tied in place with strands of hair. I assumed they were her own. During the discharge process, I discovered that she had been admitted to the psych ward of the hospital for some sort of psychotic break from reality, a possible dissociative reaction to trauma. I spoke with her psychiatrist, a pretty woman who seemed competent enough. I let her know that I would be back to check on my wife.

I was much more concerned about the fate of my presumptuous submissive. If she survived her own self bondage at my cabin, I would most certainly discipline her for this unscheduled attempt to compete for my attention. This could not go unpunished. This was an unacceptable collision of matter and anti-matter in our lives. Husband and Master cannot dwell in the same universe. The energy released from such a meeting would destroy us all. Only my will and vigilance keeps it working, and this is why my submissive must absolutely obey that will and trust my vigilant guidance.

When I arrived at the cabin, I saw her car out front with all her tires slashed. When I entered my anger melted to grave concern. The girl was nude and hooded, hanging limp from her chains. I looked for the keys to free her and they were not laid out. I ran to the first aid room and found the bolt cutters. I struggled to remove them without further damaging her already torn flesh. I got her to the bed and removed the sensory deprivation hood. Her breathing was shallow and she was unconscious. I set up our emergency IV. I discovered that she was burned on various spots across her flesh. The tender area of her nipples and over her breasts, the soles of her feet, and there was particular focus on the lips of her vagina and her clitoris. Someone had already punished her.

 I called a friend and arranged a very private room in an exclusive hospital. I knew she was going to need professional care. My submissive treasure now lay at the bottom of a comatose sea of forgetfulness. This coma lasted for 13 days, but when she awoke she was not quite the same. I had fixed her car and found her keys and personal effects at the cabin. Understandably she was quite rattled and withdrew from my life. 

My wife also spent 13 days in the psyche ward under the loving care of her psychiatrist. This female doctor really took a special interest in her. My perverted mind imagined it to be a very loving interest. Doesn't every male fantasize about such a debasement of the female holy hypocrisy? I know women do not endure the waves of lust common to men. Still, it's a beautiful fantasy.

Toward the end of her stay, my wife had to be bound in order to keep her alter ego from continuously masturbating, preventing her from sleeping or eating. During one of my visits, someone had bound her on her stomach and she was bleeding from her anus. The doctor speculated that severe stress could have caused this reaction and there was no indication of an assault. I wanted my wife to understand that I was with her no matter what, so I took out her wedding ring to put it back on her finger and she cringed, looked up at me and asked with genuine terror in her eyes, "Are you the garbage man? Please, I want to live. I will do anything you want." Then she began to hum a tune that was vaguely familiar but inappropriately creepy. I put the ring on her finger and she jerked, then laid her head down and went to sleep. 

When she awoke the next day she was happy and sane. Just like that. She seemed to absolutely adore her ring as if she was experiencing it for the first time. I took her home and she apologized for losing her mind, for assaulting my sub. She asked that if I ever wanted another one in my life, to just let her know and we can all work it out together. In the meantime, she said she wanted to be treated as a submissive wife. She begged me to train her to serve me. I do not know what happened that brought about such a complete psychic change, but I have become very happy at home pushing the boundaries of my wife's ability to submit. The solution I dreamed of seemed to find its way into an impossible situation.

 Still, I miss my original submissive and I hope she will find her way back to me.

13 DAYS OF TREATMENT:

I was in and out of consciousness. I was being sedated. My husband would come by to visit, but then I would hear that woman's voice in my head the arousal would overtake me again. I would strip and masturbate and beg to suck his cock. I could see his erection. Then finally came the day that he pulled out that massive organ, so much larger than I remember, and offered it to me if I came crawling. And her delighted voice urged me onward to humble myself before him. "Cunt, make him happy. This is the only way to redemption for you. Work like your life depended on it. Stupid cunt, serve him now and forever." He would visit every day and seemed to absolutely love pounding my slit while I was bound to the bed. When he finished he would sit beside me and sing softly,

"Who can take the girl's eyes?

Sprinkle them with goo?

Mask her face in decadence with a spurt or two

The Garbage Man can, The Garbage Man can

The Garbage Man can cause he mixes it with blood and makes the cum taste good

"the cum tastes good"

Who can take the bimbo, 

Slap her in the thigh,

Stuff it up her bun and make a groovy cream pie

The Garbage Man can, oh the Garbage Man can

The Garbage Man can cause he mixes it with blood and makes the cum taste good

"the cum tastes good"

The Garbage Man makes every slut he takes satisfying and delicious

Now you talk about your wet dream wishes

You can even beat the bitches

Who can steal tomorrow?

Rip up all your dreams

Magnify the sorrow and hide it in his cream

The Garbage Man can, oh the Garbage Man can

The Garbage Man can cause he mixes it with blood and makes the cum taste good

"the cum tastes good"

The Garbage Man makes every slut he takes satisfying and delicious

Now you talk about your wet dream wishes

You can even beat the bitches

Who can steal tomorrow?

Rip up all your dreams

Magnify the sorrow and hide it in his cream

The Garbage Man can, oh the Garbage Man can

The Garbage Man can, oh the Garbage Man can

The Garbage Man can cause he mixes it with blood and makes the cum taste good

"the cum tastes good"

The Garbage Man can cause he mixes it with blood and makes the cum taste good

"the cum tastes good"

Garbage Man, Garbage Man, oh the Garbage Man 

Makes the cum taste good

Whether he was there using me or not, the song played over and over in my head. There simply was no escape. In this white room, this place set aside to break apart, I surrendered. Whenever her voice wanted to humiliate me, I did not resist. My therapy consisted of questions that she answered in sign language. I had no voice. I then begged to eat the doctor's cunt and she obliged. She was free with my body and enjoyed our sessions. I masturbated all the time, in front of any who would watch. And in the evening he would return, do his deed, and sing his song.

Finally came the day he brought out my wedding ring, the ransom I had given in exchange for my life. He had taken me out of my restraints and put me face down. He put me back in the restraints and climbed up on the bed. My ass was not lubricated but he did not care. The head of his phallus was hot and it was aggressive in its thrusts to make entry. Symbolic of my life, the anal opening surrendered to the assault and the ramrod rhythm of his penetration took hold. He grunted above me, saliva dribbled onto my back. I bit into the mattress as the springs squeaked to announce my shame. My blood and his cum made it possible for his penetration to travel ever deeper. 

"Nobody sings while taking it up the ass. Since you are nobody, you should sing"

"What, what do you mean?"

He grabbed me by the hair and snatched my head back and shouted, "Sing!"

I was afraid. There was only one song I knew now. "The Garbage man caaan, the Garbage man can, mixes it with blood and makes the cum taste goooood. Makes cum taste goooood."

He came in my ass, pulled out and was gone. He left the room. Then he returned, and told me he was going to put my ring back on my hand, not to worry. The panic grew and I feared it was over when he put it back on my finger. I thought to plead. I think I only babbled. All went black.

When I awoke, the room was quite different. There were no restraints. There were furnishings and paintings and colors. Where was I? A nurse came running in. "She's awake! Call the doctor." I was shocked at the reaction. How long did I fall asleep? I looked at my finger, and there was no ring. There were no sign of restraints, but my wrists were very sore. Another nurse entered, looked into my eye with a light, and then just smiled at me. Then she began signing to me. When I tried to speak to tell her I did not understand sign language, there were guttural sounds in my throat but no words. I was not able to speak. Did I have a stroke? She kept signing at me, and I pushed her away. My arm brushed across my obviously swollen breasts and the nipple was very sensitive, almost painful to the touch. What the hell had happened?
