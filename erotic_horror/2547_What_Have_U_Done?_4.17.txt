 Personal Quote: "Where? Where else! Where no one else can see."

Inspired Song: Evanescence // Fallen

Age: 18

Gender: female

Nationality: African American Himalayan

Eye Color: like hazy or unclear mirrors; or dulled and silvered slate; kind of reflecting

Skin Tone: mocha -- like coffee with cream

Hair Color/Length: black, reaching to about her chin in length and somewhat curled out at the ends, extensions added from time to time for creativity, and even extensions of multi-colors

Body Type: petite

Tattoos (if any): an 'anguissette' rose at the nape of the neck between the shoulder blades

Occupation: student

Living Location: upper floor apartment, kind of homely in its own right, not run down, but not prep material either; real

Likes: poetic literature, in depth conversations, dressing goth/liberal dress, witchcraft and other liberal arts

Dislikes: being judged

Home & Family: "living" with both--mother's a drinker, father's insulting; to the parents she doesn't really exist, not entirely; so long as the housework--basic--is kept up and she keeps out of the way...etc...

Drama Summary: likes being seen, not so much heard. people see, but they don't 'see'. parents smother her creativity, denying, the kind who like to take and take giving back very little--if any...the parents are like a blanket thrown over a fire: smothering. Liric: the moth caught in a web that dangles her over a flame.

 Long lost words whisper slowly to me

Still can't find what keeps me here

When all this time I've been so hollow inside --

I know you're still there...
