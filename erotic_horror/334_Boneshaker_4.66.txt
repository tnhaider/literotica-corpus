 Yes, yes. This one took a while. I apologize. Forgive me. I've been a bit side-tracked for a bit. But it's finished now, so feel free to dance.

I have had a few people get confused on the series since I forgot to number the chapters, so I'll do that now. So far, we have: 

Dealmaker (1), Helldancer (2), Firekeeper (3), Soulseeker (4), Secretkeeper (5), Havencaller (6), Shadowrunner (6), Demonbreaker (8) and Boneshaker (9). The title of the last chapter of the series (yes, we're almost there) will be listed at the bottom of this chapter.
