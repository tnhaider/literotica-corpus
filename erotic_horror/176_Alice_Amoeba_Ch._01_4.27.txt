Blue Lake; a pristine, quiet getaway. The calm, dark waters hid many secrets. Tales of government experiments, mysterious disappearances, and strange visions permeated the local community. The year previous, a young woman vanished without a trace.

The resort of the same name closed, due in part to the disappearance. Other disasters contributed: a fire at the main building, the discovery of improperly disposed chemicals, and crushing fines against the owner. The owner cut his losses and put the property up for sale. The bad reputation frightened away the few prospects. Blue Lake earned it, a monster lived in its waters. In midsummer, the monster came out. 

A series of bubbles effervesced from the depths. They started in the middle of the lake and bubbled towards the shore. The bubbles passed an old abandoned raft where a young woman had undergone a life-changing experience. The effervescent globes stopped at the lake's edge. The waters calmed in a quiet interlude. A moment later, with slow, deliberate strides, the monster emerged, like a siren from mythology.

It strode along the lake shore. Animals nearby scattered, instinctively sensing the malevolent otherness of the creature. A few insects, mosquitoes, gnats, landed on the creature's "skin". They would not suck blood from another animal again. 

The creature strode down a path to an abandoned cabin and paused, remembering. A woman lived here; she was dead now. The cabin was deserted; the creature found nothing of interest. It continued down the trail, past a burnt out shell, to the road beyond.
