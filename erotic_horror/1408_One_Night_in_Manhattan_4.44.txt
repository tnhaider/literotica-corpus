 Horror isn't my usual genre for trying to write something — or, for that matter, my choice for my own entertainment when it comes to books and movies — but I thought I'd give it a try for ChloeTzang's event given the "night" theme. So, I'm an utter novice at this. 

Plus, I thought I'd try something a bit ... tonal? Recipe for disaster, I know.

This isn't a pleasant tale (he said, with a nod indicating the name of the category it's posted in). So, if a story with violence and reluctance and not an ounce of tenderness really isn't your thing, please don't read it.
