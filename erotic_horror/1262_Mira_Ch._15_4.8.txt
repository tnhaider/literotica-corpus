 Okay guys, it's been a fun ride, but this is it. Mira is over, sorta... Tee Hee... You'll find some hints in the epilogue. I've got a few ideas that I'm going to use. Don't take that wrong. I'm not doing a sequel to Mira. I'm going back to Leader of the Pack now. Yes you all heard me right. Keep an eye on my profile. You should be seeing more chapters of LOTP hitting Lit shortly. As for you Mira lovers, there is a revised version of Mira that will be available. And it is significantly different in some respects from what has been on Lit. Send me a feedback or check my bio info for more information on that...
