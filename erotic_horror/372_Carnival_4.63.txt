 Present day

Phoenix stood, looking down from the balcony to the street below. The party would start in a few hours; people coming from miles away, filling the streets with costumed revelers in their masks and cloaks. She smirked at the theme of this year's Carnival: Virgins and Vampires. Little did they know!

She turned and walked back into her studio, closing the stained glass doors behind her to shut out the noise. The heels of her boots clicked on the tile floors as she crossed the room to the large antique wardrobe. Opening the intricately carved doors she smiled as she pulled out the tabarro she would wear over her bautta. She held it up to her throat as she looked in the mirror. Her choice was a traditional look. The black cloak would give her an appearance of being larger and possibly manly. Once she had her bautta or hooded part of her costume on she would doff the plain white mask and three-cornered hat. Her dark hair would be hidden under her hood; she didn't want to stand out in the crowd, except to one person.
