 Li Antonius smiled up at the dark moon above him. Its feeble light barely lit the clearing he was in, but that didn't matter. He could see just fine. He laughed humorlessly up at its inky surface, how long had it been since the humans turned the moon black? He could barely remember; and even though the lack of its silvery light no longer hurt him, it still filled him with a bitter longing for a half-remembered warmth.

He pulled his long mane of blonde hair back and tied it with a bit of old leather. His simple peasant shirt hung off of his muscled torso and tight leather breeches accentuated his perfect ass. Li adjusted himself and stretched his legs. He had a long way yet to go this night to get to Sumentia and he was looking forward to the run.
