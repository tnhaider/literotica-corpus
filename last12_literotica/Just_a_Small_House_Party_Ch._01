 Andrew groaned as he pushed an obnoxiously loud shopping cart through the small isles of the local grocery store. He hated food shopping, but since his parents were out of town all week on vacation, it became his responsibility. Suddenly his phone buzzed in his pocket. It was a text from his little sister, Madison.

"Hey, while you're out getting groceries, would you mind picking up some booze for me and my friends tonight? I'll pay you back, pinky promise :) "

He groaned, knowing fully well that his eighteen-year-old sister was taking advantage of the fact that she had a twenty-one year old brother. This was the second time she had asked him to buy her alcohol, and the first time didn't go so well. Their parents nearly kicked him out of their house when they found out he'd unknowingly supplied booze for her and the dozen or so high- schoolers that threw a party in their basement. 

He texted back, "Not if its gonna be like last time, Mom and Dad almost killed me"

"It won't be! It's just me and two of my girlfriends, we're having a sleepover at our place. Mom even said that I could have people over while they were away"

He thought it over, then he rolled his eyes. "Fine. What do you want? Beer, wine, liquor...?"

"Just a handle of vodka please, and get some juice for mixers. I'll pay for that too, don't worry. Love you!"

He finished his grocery shopping and stopped by the liquor store, picking up a handle of cheap vodka, per his sister's request.

He got back to the house and saw an unfamiliar car in the driveway. Were her friends there already? He heard music playing from outside the house, so they must have it turned up super loud.

Awesome, a noise complaint was just what he needed tonight.

Andrew opened the door and was met with the blaring pop music and thumping bass coming from a portable speaker. He walked in and saw his little sister and two other girls, all standing in the kitchen and gossiping to each other over the loud music. 

Madison (or as everyone else called her, Maddie) was the first of them to notice he'd come in. Madison was, and had always been, beautiful. Even when she was growing up, she would always be the prettiest girl in her class. 

She had long, blonde hair that went to the middle of her back, deep hazel eyes, a lovely face, and a body that was petite, but she'd grown curves in all the right places to stop her from looking like a twig. She'd was the typical popular high school girl, going to parties and having boys fawning over her left and right. 

Growing up, she and Andrew had always been super close, and even when they fought or yelled at each other, they'd almost immediately feel bad and apologize. He had always been overly protective of her, especially when she grew up and became a young woman. He had always half-joked that if any guy ever bothered her, to "just tell me his name and address."

Now his adorable little sister was wearing a black and white striped crop top that came up to just above her pierced belly button, showing off her slim little waist. She also had on solid black leggings, which outlined her tight butt and slender legs. She was looking really good, Andrew thought to himself. If she were anyone but sister, he'd even call her hot.

Madison walked up to him, a nervous smile on her pretty face.

"Did you get it?" she asked excitedly. 

He handed her the bag containing the large plastic bottle of vodka and a couple bottles of cranberry juice he'd bought at the grocery store for mixers.

"Course I got it, you think I'd lie?" he said with a smile.

She looked in the bag, her face lighting up.

"Oh my god Andy you're the best, thank you so much, love you!" she gave him a quick kiss on the cheek before running back to the kitchen, her friends all shrieking with excitement at the presence of alcohol. He laughed, wishing he could still be that excited about drinking.

He walked into the kitchen and saw her and her two friends already making drinks, haphazardly mixing them in classic red solo cups.

The first of her friends that he noticed was Lilly, a tall girl with long red hair, stunning green eyes and a cute face that was covered in freckles, making her even cuter. She lived a few houses down from them and had been Madison's best friend since middle school. They were always together, hanging out at one of their houses nearly every day after school. 

Lilly had developed a harmless crush on him a few years back, but recently it seemed to have become not so harmless, even going so far as her secretly asking him out on a date earlier that year. Of course he had denied and told her it wasn't a good idea, for Madison's sake, but ever since then he couldn't help but notice how attractive she was, with her slim body and fiery red hair. 

She was wearing a small white and pink basketball jersey, only she had cut it so it exposed her tight stomach up to her belly button. Because it was loose and hung off her body, she wore a black lace bra underneath it, showing off her small but cute chest. Continuing with the athletic look, she wore tight little gym shorts that clung to her tight ass and black knee socks with pink stripes at the top that showed off her toned but slim legs. 

He noticed that she blushed a little when they made eye contact, giving him a smile and small wave.

"Hi Andrew." she said softly, a hint of shyness in her voice.

The other girl was Kim, a pretty Asian girl that became friends with Madison a couple years ago. She had always been flirty with him whenever she was over their house, always trying to make him notice her by wearing revealing clothes and giving him seductive glances. 

Tonight was no different, as she was dressed in a thin white lace bralette that showed off her big D-cup tits and revealed her entire stomach, as well as skin-tight black leggings that accentuated her sizable butt. She had a curvy body comparable to a girl several years older than her, one that he admitted to himself was actually pretty hot.

"Hey Andy." she purred, giving him her signature doe-eyed stare, leaning over the counter as she did and gave him an eyeful of her cleavage which he acknowledged but refused to look at. 

He gave both cute girls a wave and a smile.

"Hey, enjoy that vodka but be careful. I'm assuming you girls already know, but it has a tendency to sneak up on you real fast, so don't go crazy." 

"Okay!" the three of them said in unison.

Andrew turned and went upstairs to his room, closing his door behind him to shut our as much of the loud music as possible. He looked at himself in the full-length mirror, fixing his naturally messy dirty blonde hair. He had inherited his Dad's jawline and mom's love for going to the gym, and he wasn't jacked, but definitely fit. Even in just his thin t-shirt and jeans, he knew why Lilly had blushed when she saw him. He was looking good. Being fawned over by his little sister's friends wasn't exactly the ideal scenario, but the attention never hurt. 

His thoughts drifted to Lilly, those long legs and tight stomach completely bare in her little outfit. He suddenly pondered what it would've been like if he had said yes to going out with her, if she had become his girlfriend.

He would've been able to hold her close and kiss her deeply, slipping his tongue into her little mouth. He would've been able to rip off her clothes and feel her lithe naked body against his, then hear her moaning his name as he pushed his dick into her tight little pussy and fucked her nice and hard. 

Stuck in his own horny thoughts, his imagination soon drifted to Madison. Andrew envisioned his little sister watching them, staring in shock as he shoved his cock into her best friend. He imagined that it secretly turned her on, stripping off her cute outfit right in front of them, making long eye contact with him as she got naked before shoving her tongue into Lilly's mouth and making out with her, hard. He pictured her tight little body soon bouncing on his cock, moaning hotly for him. He could almost hear her begging for him, "Fuck me Andy, fuck your hot little sister!"

He suddenly snapped out of it, realizing he'd gotten rock hard from his daydream. 

"Jesus Christ, I'm such a sick fuck." he thought. He shook his head and tried to do some work on his laptop to distract himself from both his own subconscious thoughts and the subsequent bulge in his jeans. 

After a few minutes, he heard a knock on his door. He got up, double checking that his erection had gone down (it had), and opened the door. Madison was standing there, looking adorable as always, holding a drink in each hand.

"Since you bought us this booze, I thought you wouldn't mind coming down and helping us drink it. What do you say?" 

He took one of the cups from her, not intending to drink it. He had quite a few bad nights that were caused by vodka, and even a whiff of the concoction in his hand made his stomach turn from the memories.

"Ehhh I'll pass, drinking with three high school girls doesn't exactly sound like my kind of fun." he half-lied. It normally wouldn't have been fun, but the idea of getting drunk and hanging out with these girls in particular was somewhat tempting.

"Oh come onnnn Andy" she groaned. "You mean to tell me you'd rather sit in your room alone than get drunk with three cute girls?" She playfully leaned against his door frame, giving him a sultry look and tucking a piece of her blonde hair behind her pierced ear.

"You mean two cute girls and an obnoxious little sister?"

"Rude."

His face warmed slightly as he glanced at his little sister's body. Her outfit revealed her slim but lovely frame, showing off her tight stomach and cute ass. His mind briefly wandered back to his dirty thoughts from before, imagining ripping off her little top and leggings and grabbing her sexy little body. Her exaggerated porn-like moans once again echoed in his head, "Fuck me Andy, god you're such a good big brother!"

He realized his own thoughts, hating himself for even thinking about her like that, not only once, but twice. Disgusted with himself, he took a sip of the drink she had brought him, instantly regretting it.

"Jesus Christ! What is this, like 10% juice and 90% vodka?" He winced, feeling the burn of the alcohol as it went down his throat.

She giggled and shrugged innocently, "Maybe? I just suck at making drinks, I never know how to mix it right!"

He sighed and stood up, "Alright, I'll come down. But ONLY because if you keep making drinks this bad you'll either end up over the toilet or in the hospital, and I honestly don't feeling like dealing with either of those things tonight."

"Yay! Come on!" she said excitedly, grabbing his arm and pulling him out of his room and downstairs.

When the two other girls saw him, their cute faces lit up.

"Andrew!" Kim yelled, running over and wrapping her arms tightly around him, pressing her big tits into his chest. She was clearly already tipsy, nearly falling over after crashing into him. 

"Nice to see you again." he laughed, holding her against him for a second. He smelled the sweet floral perfume she liked to wear whenever he was around, probably with the hope that he'd one day notice the familiar scent and think about her or compliment her.

Lilly was much more subtle and just gave him a cute smile, but he noticed that she looked a little envious, shifting uncomfortably when he had his arms around Kim. 

"I tried a drink that Madison made and nearly died, so I'm going to make you girls some drinks that won't literally kill you." he said, going into the fridge and pulling out a lime and some ice cubes and putting them on the large kitchen island.

He took a cup and poured an exact amount of vodka, then an equally exact amount of cranberry juice. He grabbed a knife and quartered the lime, which he then squeezed into the cup, also adding a slice on the side of the glass. After dropping in a few ice cubes and stirring, his drink was ready.

"I present to you, a vodka cran with lime. Found in the hand of every girl at every college bar in the country." he said, handing it to Madison, who cautiously took a sip.

"Oh my god Andy, that's incredible!" she gasped, taking a much larger sip.

Lilly took it from her, putting it to her lips and taking a drink as well.

"Holy shit, it's like half vodka but you can't even taste it!"

"Lemme try!" Kim said and stole it next, almost polishing it off.

"This is like the best drink I've ever had!" she said, giggling and slurring her words just a bit.

And with their approval of his drink, he proceeded to make one for each girl in large plastic cups, then an extra strong one for himself. He needed to catch up to them, and his tolerance was twice what theirs was.

They drank and laughed, the girls dancing and singing along to the loud music while he leaned on the kitchen counter watched. He was trying his hardest not to let his perverted imagination get the better of him, but the combination of the deceptively strong drink and the sight of three hot girls dancing on each other in revealing outfits was making that fairly difficult. Even if one of them was his sister.

Kim suddenly grabbed him and pulled him into her, her face inches away from his. When she saw his face redden, she gave a little wink and turned around, grinding her ass into his crotch. 

At this point, the alcohol was giving him the courage to be bold, so he grabbed Kim's curvy hips and pulled them back into his, pushing his dick against her. She grabbed the edge of the nearby table and bent over, giving him a full view of her juicy ass in the tight leggings. 

The other two girls were shocked by him; they had gotten used to Kim's flirtations towards him, but neither of them expected him to ever reciprocate. Looking past Kim, Andrew saw that Lilly was definitely jealous and even Madison was blushing, watching her older brother grind on her best friend. 

To distract herself, Lilly grabbed Madison and bent her over, grinding her hips into Madison's tight ass. They were laughing the whole time and playing it off as a joke, but they started getting into it just as much as he and Kim were, both girls subconsciously doing it in hopes of getting Andrew's attention. 

Kim's competitive spirit kicked in, knowing the other two were trying to one up her. She turned around so that her face was inches away from Andrew's. They locked eyes for a moment, and in that short moment, he tuned out the blaring music in the background, the only sound coming from his racing heartbeat.

Kim closed her eyes and leaned in, gently touching her lips to his. It sent shivers down his spine and gave him goosebumps, as well as a jolt to his dick. He closed his eyes and savored the moment as long as he could, breathing in and smelling her lovely perfume. After their lips separated, he instinctively went in for another kiss, but instead found her finger pressed lightly against his lips. He opened his eyes to see her giving him a playful wink as a sly smile crossed her face. 

A cat-call whistle from Madison snapped him out of the moment, and the loud music that he'd drowned out continued blasting from the speaker. His face was beet-red, still slightly in shock. 

Kim giggled and finished what was left of her drink, placing the empty cup on the table. 

"Oops." she said playfully.

Madison rolled her eyes and took another sip of her drink as well, but Lilly was looking at her phone, her face as red as her hair. If she was pretending not to care, she wasn't doing a very good job. 

Andrew didn't exactly know how to respond, but luckily he didn't have to because Come On Eileen started blasting over the speaker.

Not a single drunk person in the history of drunk people has ever been able to resist singing, if not dancing, to Come On Eileen. It's an indisputable, scientifically-proven fact.

He fixed himself and the girls another (albeit weaker, he still didn't feel like spending the night at the hospital) drink, singing and dancing is exactly what they did. Any and all sexual tension in the room seemed to dissipate immediately, none of them able to resist belting out the words to one of the catchiest songs in all of pop music.

They all seemed to forget that Kim had just kissed him, just chalking it up to being drunk. That is, all but Lilly, whose jealousy was now blatantly obvious. She was now dancing even closer to him, moving her hands all over his arms and chest as they danced.

They suddenly locked eyes, Andrew noticing that her's were different from before. Normally kind and innocent, her striking green eyes were now filled with an alcohol-fueled passion that he'd never seen before, but was definitely into. Lilly wrapped her arms around him and pulled him into her slim body, kissing him suddenly. In his drunken state, he just couldn't resist the cute redhead's advances and before he knew it, his hands were roaming all over her body as they kissed passionately, feeling the smooth and warm skin of her bare stomach. 

They only stopped kissing and grabbing each other when Kim and Madison started whistling and cheering, both of them relieved that Lilly had finally shown her true feelings towards him.

Lilly let go of him and stepped back, smiling at him as she blushed cutely. 

"Just, uh, my way of thanking you for getting us the booze." she said innocently.

"Hell of a reward." he muttered, hoping the half-chub in his jeans wasn't visible. 

"Your turn Maddie!" Kim shouted as she playfully shoved Madison towards her brother.

"What?!" the brother and sister exclaimed in unison, shocked expressions on both their faces.

"There's absolutely no way I'm kissing Andy, you perv." she protested as she blushed, crossing her arms over her crop-top-covered chest.

"And there's no way I'm kissing my little sister." he added, feeling a pit in his stomach as he knew he secretly wanted to. 

His sober mind had previously told him that he was wrong for having such sexual thoughts about her, but the booze was making him forget that. In fact, it was reversing his conscience, the thought of how wrong it was to make out with his pretty little sister instead turning him on. She was looking so good in her little outfit, and he had a sudden urge to find out what was underneath it. 

"Oh come onnnn, just one little kiss!" Kim drunkenly persisted. 

"One little kiss! One little kiss! One little kiss!" she and Lilly chanted.

"Jesus, if it'll get you two to shut up, then fine!" Madison snapped. Approaching Andrew and looking up at him with an apologetic smile, she wrapped her arm gently around his waist and pulled him into her warm body.

"Love you, Andy." she said sweetly before tilting her head up and placing a quick kiss on his lips. It was as cute and harmless as a kiss could be, but that wasn't what got to him. It was the fact that she didn't immediately pull away from the kiss, letting her wet lips linger on his for just a split second, as if she was inviting him in for another. 

Andrew was taken aback by his little sister's sudden boldness, his mind racing as he struggled to make sense of what was going on. Unfortunately for him, Madison wriggled away just as he was about to lean in for another kiss, his confusion and delayed reaction causing him to miss his chance.

Kim and Lilly cheered and went "awww", both of them commenting on how adorable they were. Neither of them seemed to catch Madison's little move, but it kept playing in his mind over and over. Was that intentional? Did she want him like he wanted her?

"Now you two kiss!" Madison pointed at her two girl friends, who were standing beside each other. 

"Okay!" Kim said happily, turning and wrapping her arms around Lilly's cute body, leaning in.

"W-wait!" Lilly said nervously, her face red again. "I've never, uh, kissed another girl..."
