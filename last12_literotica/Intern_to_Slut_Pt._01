 It was a warm and sunny early August morning when Brian Smith pulled into the parking garage in the building below the office of his engineering firm. The construction season was in full swing, but design work was slowing down until the winter rush for next spring. Brian was coming in early as he usually did to get a jump on the day. He took the elevator up to the rear entrance of the office.

Typically on a Monday morning Brian was the first person in the office. There was a small staff of 10 that kept busy, but he like to get in well before 6:00 A.M. to get through e-mails and other administrative items before being bothered by the questions and concerns of the day. Brian entered the rear door and went to the break room to put on a pot of coffee, to his surprise there was already a fresh pot brewed. 

He left the break room and headed down the aisle of offices and cubicles that his staff used. All were empty, but as he approached the front of the main office space he could start to hear what sounded like a video playing on a computer. He quickly realized the noise was coming from the cubicle of the new college intern, Nicole, who was hired just the previous week. She had seemed very eager to get started on her career during the interview process. Brian was happy to have her on staff to help out with what design tasks she could, with her limited experience and also take some of the pressure off other staff to answer phones and speak to clients who stopped by the office. As such her cubicle was near the main entrance to the office so she could greet any clients that came in. Brian changed his path to his office in the back corner to swing by her cube to say "good morning," so that she knew her early arrival and initiative did not go unnoticed.

As he approached Nicole's cubicle from behind, Brian noticed the sound of the video was not that of a standard news item or YouTube spot that she may have been catching up on before getting started on work in the morning. Instead it was the unmistakable moans and quiet slapping of porn. Brian slowed as he approached and could see over Nicole's shoulder onto her screen a video of a women bent over a counter or desk being fucked from behind. This was wholly inappropriate for the new hire, but Brian did not yet reveal himself. Nicole was an attractive 23 year old college senior with strawberry blonde hair, more strawberry than blonde, shortish at about 5'-2", a body that still just had that bit of baby fat or "freshman 15" that gave her a girlish softness that was very enticing to Brian. During the interview process he had been very professional and thought nothing of it but he was definitely attracter to her. A plan started to form, as he continued to walk past and to his office.

Brian continued on, and nearing the back side of Nicole's work space, he could further see over her shoulder as she sat slightly slumped in her chair. To his surprise, Brian began to see, that not only was she watching an inappropriate video on her work computer, the front of her pants were open and she appeared to be masturbating with her hand down the front of her underwear. This was not proper behavior, new hire or not, but this further compromising position played right into Brian's hands. He continued on walking past Nicole's cubicle only slightly slowing to look over to her and say, "Good Morning, Nicole," as he past. 

This, of course, jolted her from her trance, she sat bolt upright as she pulled her hand from her underwear and quickly reached for the mouse to minimize the video that was playing. Brian continued past and turned back to his office without acknowledging her stammered response, "er...um...hi...um...I mean... good morning...Mr. Smith." Brian smiled slightly as he sat down in his office and thought, "this is going to be interesting."

"Oh shit, shit, shit, shit..." Nicole thought as she hurriedly redid her pants and belt. "What was I thinking?" She had just been hired to Mr. Smith's firm and only started working last week. "If I fuck this up what will I tell my friends, my parents, and my professor who recommended me for this internship?" What could she tell her parents had happened to get her fired in just over a week? How could she face her professor in class? What would she tell her friends? "Oh, fuck! My friends!" she thought.  

Nicole had been extremely excited to get an interview with Mr. Smith's firm and had talked about it with her entire friend group. When she arrived for the interview she was immediately taken aback when meeting Mr. Smith. He had stood up to greet her as he walked in the office and towered over her at 6'-5". Everything in the interview process and her first week of work had been completely professional, however, she would occasionally steal glances and had noticed the athletic body lurking under his office casual clothes, and did she notice a particular glint in his eye every time they interacted? "C'mon Nicole," she would tell herself, "he's at least 10 years...maybe 15 years older than you. That's ridiculous."

After her first week of work Nicole had made plans to go out with some of her friends. After a few drinks the conversation had shifted to how she liked her new internship. Having only been on the job for a week there wasn't too much to talk about yet, just getting used to how things worked. Maybe it was the lack of excitement in the first week of work, or the few drinks, but she had started down a rant about her tall boss with just a little bit of grey in his short, dirty blonde hair. They teased her mercilessly for over a half hour about wanting to be, "...some cliché porn secretary, bent over her boss's desk, being punished, and fucked...and what a little slut she was." 

That had planted the seed; not only the cliché fantasy, but that term, "a slut." She had been a "good girl" not a prude, she had had two boyfriends in college and experimented liberally, but never the "slut." She didn't go out just to pick up a cheap fuck and had mainly spent her college years with friends and studying. Now, with that thought in her mind, Nicole started to think, "Maybe I should get out there more."

In anticipation of going back to work Monday morning, Nicole had spent Sunday evening thinking about exactly that. She had tossed and turned all night trying to forget about the sensation that grew in her chest and between her legs, but she didn't want her friend's to be right after the teasing, so she resisted her urges. Finally after a few hours of sleep she woke early decided to just get up and go into work. 

As Nicole arrived at the office, well before anybody else would get there, surely, she settled in to getting ahead on tasks to get ahead for the day. Nicole's thoughts, though, once again returned to that image that her friends had put in her mind. Her boss's desk, which played such a role in this fantasy, was just around the corner. The familiar tingle returned. Nicole thought about making it through the whole work day without some relief. She glanced at the clock, 5:45 A.M., surely nobody would be here for at least an hour and a half, one hour minimum, she thought. She pulled up pornhub on her browser and searched.

Now, here she was, watching "...some cliché porn secretary, bent over her boss's desk, being punished, and fucked..." with her hand down the front of her underwear trying to drive her new fantasy of being a slut out of her mind with a self-induced orgasm. To her complete horror as well, caught by the man with the co-leading role in that fantasy.

Nicole quickly tried to compose herself as she watched Mr. Smith walk away to his office. She sat up fully straight, redid her pants fully, and tried to quickly tuck in her shirt. She couldn't help but notice Mr. Smith's muscular shoulders, back, and legs through his office clothes and that did nothing to slow her mind and its fantasy, or slow the flow of wetness from between her legs that had been worked up due to her previous actions. Her mind raced, what was she going to do, what possible innocent explanation could she come up with? Maybe he didn't see; he didn't stop; he barely slowed to say, "Good Morning." No, of course he saw.

Brian sat down at his desk and set up his laptop just as he would any other Monday morning. Silently he thought and planned as well. How long should he let Nicole stew before calling her into his office to discuss what he had just witnessed? Unlike Nicole, he was regularly in the office this early, the clock on his desk ticked over 5:56 A.M. and he knew he had a least an hour and a half before anybody else on his staff would be in.

Deep down the young intern knew she would have to confront this issue that she had created. Perhaps, beg mercy and forgiveness, it would be okay, it would all work out. Then in the far reaches of her mind, that fantasy started to germinate again, would he punish her, get her to say she would, "do anything," to save her job. "Damnit, Nicole, stop that, this isn't some school girl fantasy." she thought, "this is the real world these things don't happen, and you're going to lose your job."

This admonishment did nothing to quell the rising feelings in her chest and between her legs. Nicole took a deep breath, resolved to confront the issue head on, and got up to go to his office and talk directly to Mr. Smith.

The head of the firm was somewhat surprised when there was a knock on his door jamb after only a few minutes. Sheepishly, he saw, Nicole peer around the corner, "Mr. Smith, do you have a minute to talk." He glanced up from his computer and saw her head around the doorway, reddish blonde wavy hair falling just past her shoulder. She was visibly flush in the face which brought the faint, but distinct freckles on her cheeks, which he could now see extended down her neck and onto her chest above the open top button of her dress shirt. Was she blushing with embarrassment or was there cause more primal?

"Yes, Nicole, I think we should talk." Brian responded.

That confirmed it, the tone and the surety in his voice, Mr. Smith definitely had seen what was happening, Nicole thought as she enter and stepped up to the front of his desk. She could still feel the wetness between her legs and knew it was starting to dampen her panties under her form fitted dress pants. 

Brian pushed away from his desk and leaned back in his chair as Nicole entered. Quickly taking her in fully as she stood a foot or two back from his desk. She wore a simple white button down dress shirt, somewhat messily tucked into grey dress pants, likely due to a quick adjustment from her earlier "situation." The shirt and pants were tailored to slim around her waist but out to accommodate her chest and hips. Somewhat more formal than typical of the firm, Nicole was trying to impress in the business world and Brian didn't mind the way the clothes, though conservative, accentuated her body. She was short, fit but soft in the way that young women are as they are just finally growing into their bodies, a very nice proportion in Brian's mind.

As he pushed away from his desk and looked up at her face, Nicole naturally lowered her gaze in embarrassment and deference. Her view panned down across his muscular chest as he crossed his arms, and stopped just above his desk. Gazing absentmindedly at Mr. Smith's crotch she wondered, what, exactly, the rough khaki hid. The feeling in her own nether areas still building. "Thank god, I wore pants and not a skirt, at least he can't smell 'it'" she hoped, "wait could he?"

Nicole started, "Mr. Smith, I..."

"Nicole, I think we both know what was going on at your desk this morning." Brian Interrupted sternly. "Is that how you want to start your career? Is that what you want your colleagues to think you are?"

"No, Mr. Smith...er...I...um...I don't know..." Nicole stammered. Her boss had only ever been professionally friendly and treated her as a peer. The sudden authority in his voice had thrown her, and knocked her off the script explanation she had prepared in her head.

"You don't want rumors and innuendo to haunt you your entire career do you, Nicole? To be known as 'that slut' that can't even keep her hand out of her own pants at work? Do you?"

Nicole let out a small gasp that was almost a moan as soon as the word "slut" was used. How could he have known, no surely it was just chance, but still... Her face and chest further reddened and breasts heaved slightly as she noticed herself breathe deeply for just a beat. The gasp and change in Nicole did not go unnoticed by Brian, the further delay in a response only confirmed to him that at some level that is exactly what she wanted.

"Well do you, Nicole?" he asked again, "Do you want to be 'that slut?'"

Not, 'known as...' Nicole thought quickly but '...to be that slut.' That term, something had changed in her over the last couple days. She was a good girl, but did she want that?

"No Mr. Smith...sir. I don't..."

"Sir...I like that." Brian once again interrupted, as he stood from his chair and moved around his desk. 

As he rose to his full height and looked down at Nicole. She tried to look him straight in the eye as she was taught in professional settings but could not hold his suddenly authoritative gaze. She again realized how her body continued to betray her. In the ten minutes since he first interrupted her at her desk until now her fantasies had been going wild in her head. No matter how much rational thought she tried to use to overcome this feeling it had persevered through. She had to avoid the embarrassment of losing her job, but would she, "do anything," if confronted? Still conflicted but at this point she knew her panties had to be soaked. As he neared she again wondered if he could smell her heat, could she?

Brian walked past Nicole over to the door of his office, waited half a second then shut it. Though, nothing had been said, Nicole knew to stay where she was at the front of his desk, now facing away from him. He stood again to admire her from behind, her dress pants tailored nicely to show off her ass that stood firm thanks to some help from her low heeled shoes.

Again Brian spoke, "I think you do, I think that's what you are. I think you're a slut." Nicole stood frozen, unable to respond. Brian crossed back to her, stood behind her and put his hands lightly on her hips, "Is that what you are? Are you a slut?" 

Her brain told her to speak up and say, "No!" but her body would did not respond to the impulse. Instead she leaned back her neck and head against his chest, "I...um...nee...er..."

His hand moved up and grazed her breast through her shirt and bra as it moved to her chin. He grabbed face with authority but not malice and tilted her face up to look at him behind her, the other hand grasping her tightly at her waist just on her left hip. "I saw the video you were watching while trying to pleasure yourself," he said, "is that what you want. To be taken like a slutty secretary?"

Nicole opened her mouth to respond, but couldn't, it was just a fantasy, she was a good girl, not a slut, but still her body betrayed her. She was almost in a trance, stuck somewhere between desire and "what a good girl should do," whatever that meant at this point.

"Did you finish?" Brian asked.

This matter of fact question snapped Nicole back to consciousness, "What?"

"Did you finish?" Brian repeated, as his hand left her face, again brushing against her body, beginning to manipulate her belt.

"What, I...no..." Nicole responded.

"No...what?" Brian further pressed as he undid her belt and began working on the buttons at the top of her pants.

She did not move to stop him, her hand reached up and back to grab the back of his neck half wanting to pull him closer, and half to support herself on her steadily weakening legs. "No, I didn't finish."

"No, I didn't finish...what." He again repeated the fly on her dress pants now fully open.

Now open to the air the smell of her heat drifted up from her panties and hit her nostrils, there was no doubt now that Brian knew the desires of Nicole's body. Why had her body betrayed her in this way? There hadn't even been any negotiation, no threats to fire her and Nicole pleading for her job. He was simply taking what he wanted. "No, I didn't finish, sir."

Brian did, in fact, start to smell her desire and his manhood began to respond, but that would have to wait. He had other plans to pull Nicole under his sway. 

"It seems to me, you still want to finish." He said, sliding his hand over the front of her underwear. Nicole took a small step to widen her stance and open her legs. Brian knew he had her now, beginning to massage her pussy through the thoroughly sudden gusset of her panties.

At his touch she breathlessly gasped, "Yes...yes sir, I still want to finish."

His touch was now gone momentarily, and she thrust her hips slightly forward to follow the leaving fingers. She did not have to wait long as his hand now slid into her panties, fingers inching past her red tufted mound, momentarily grazing her clit, and finally one middle finger caressing her well lubricated lips. Slowly spreading them and entering her.

Nicole again, gasped and took a deep breath at this touch. She gripped the back of Brian's neck harder as her knees further weakened. She reached with her other hand and held Brian's hand tight to her hip. Pressing her hips forward her body begged to be fully invaded by this finger, but Brian pulled back, only allowing one knuckle past her entrance. Her hips rocked as she tried to get more of Brian's hand inside of her, grinding her clit against his rough palm. She was already so close to cumming, but he was still teasing her.

"That is what you are, isn't it? A slut." Brian breathed into Nicole's ear.

"Yes, yes..." Nicole was pleading now. She needed more.

"Yes...what." Brian responded.

"Yes, sir, I am a slut."

As she said it, Brian's finger fully entered her curling onto the front wall of her pussy and rubbing hard directly on her g-spot. Nicole moaned loudly as she pressed her ass back onto Brian's crotch. Her pants fell to her knees, exposing her cheeks around her small cotton thong. She felt his hardness through his rough khakis as his hand left her hip joining the other sliding into her stretched panties, quickly finding the nub of her clit. Now, being manipulated by both hands Nicole further weakened, almost completely supported by the hand grasping Brian's neck Nicole reached back with her other hand grabbing his muscular ass and pulling him closer as she ground her ass into his hardness.

Nicole's moans were gaining strength. That along with her nearly naked ass pushing against him had Brian's erection at full attention in his pants. He could simply push her forward over his desk and take all that he wanted of his young intern, but no, that was for another day. He resisted his own urges in order to fully make her his.

Brian could feel Nicole's legs further weaken and begin to tremble. He knew she was close to cumming. He eased his manipulation of her clit and withdrew his finger to just tease her again.

"Please, sir, I'm so close." Nicole begged. Legs still trembling as she tried to push and force her orgasm on.

"Are you a slut?"

"Yes, sir, I'm a slut."

"Are you MY slut?" Brian growled.

"YES SIR, I AM YOUR SLUT!" Nicole screamed as Brian thrust his finger back inside her, pushing down on her clit has he did.

Nicole's legs fully weakened as the first wave of orgasm overcame her, almost fully supported by Brian's hands in and on her pussy as well the hand desperately clinging to the back of his neck. Her abdomen clenched and spasmed, her ass quivered, and her legs almost kicked up in the air as she came, moaning loudly. 

As the wave of her orgasm started to subside Brian's touch on her clit and inside her pussy became almost too much for Nicole to bear, and she started to close her legs to force his hands out.
