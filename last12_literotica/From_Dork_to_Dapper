 I never imagined I'd ever even think this, but damn, my little brother is hot.

It's not that I never noticed it before. It's because... well, because he used to not be. He'd always been a short, chubby nerd, but in the two years that I was abroad, he'd slimmed down and shot up. Liam was still a nerd—no doubt about that—but I was positive that a new wardrobe and contact lenses instead of his thick beer-bottle-bottom glasses could easily make him the hottest kid in his school.
