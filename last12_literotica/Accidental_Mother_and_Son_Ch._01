Accidental Mother and Son

Chapter 1: Mom is Kathy

March 23, 2014

It's 2:20 AM and I'm starting this journal as a record of sorts - maybe a diary? I'm conflicted right now because something happened. Well, it happened a few times and I feel like things are about to get very difficult at home. I'll try to piece it together so it makes sense when I have to explain to Mark what happened in the past several weeks.

Mark is my son and is 23 years old. He's never left the house since graduating high school because he was attending a local college. He graduated last year and I agreed to let him stay until he finds something that more matches his degree and could be considered a viable career. He's was dating Kathy up until about 6 months ago. They met when he was in 10th grade and he confided in me his plans to marry her. I don't know exactly what split them up because he never talked to me about it. I overheard him mention it casually to someone else.

Regardless, that event in his life coincided with his downward spiral into alcohol abuse. I would not call him an alcoholic so much as I would say he's just someone who when he decides to drink, he cannot stop until he is blackout drunk. I had seen him come home many times in the past in this state. His Uber driver would often help him to the door and I would always tip the driver; thanking him for ensuring he got home ok. Most drivers thanked me and said that he was the responsible one for ensuring this was the way he got some. Some had a disgusted look on their face.

One particular evening, it would seem he was not ready to pass out just yet. I waited up for him as I always did and waited for him to go to bed. Instead, however, he came into the kitchen where I was sitting and sat down across from me. He began speaking in a heavily slurred manner and I could hardly tell what he was trying to tell me. At the end of his sentences, he would emphasize his words and I could hear words like "Kathy" and "marry." It was apparent he was not over her. I also noted that he was in a... mood. While talking and trying to keep his eyes open, he would routinely shift his eyes to my chest.

Thinking back on that first time, I suppose I should not have been surprised. His father would do that as well. He would come home drunk, continue drinking and stare at my chest. If the mood got him right, he would creep up behind me and put his hands on me. I made the mistake one night of attempting to fight him off, saying he was drunk. He screamed at me that he was NOT drunk and that I should be more adventurous. I remember it...

** YEARS EARLIER **

"Mark's not home! Get your tits out and raise that dress of yours... I'm gonna make you feel like the woman you aught to be!"

He tried to do both for me, but I jabbed my elbow into his ribs. The next thing I remember, I woke up on the kitchen floor, my head in pain in several spots. I guess he was having nothing of "my sass," as he would say, and closed fist punched me in the back of the head. Looking at myself in the mirror the next morning, I had a large bruise on my forehead and jaw, and a cut lip. I am guessing my forehead hit the cabinet in front of me, knocking me out. Collapsing, my jaw must have hit the counter and my lip busted open when I hit the floor.

----

Anyways, Mark's behavior that night made me feel all of that again and while a part of me was scared, I was also hoping he would say enough that I could catch a few key words and put the puzzle pieces together. I remember having an idea to make him some coffee to maybe help him sober up a little so I could ask questions and get intelligent answers... or close to it. I remember the rest of that night vividly.

Here is what I remember:

** THAT NIGHT **

"ansh them thur wer Kathy. Shesh te besht ma. Yoouu know?" He slurred out.

"I know she is, honey. Would you like some coffee? It'll help you wake up a little." I asked noticing he wasn't paying particular attention to me at that moment.

"Shhhherrrrrr!" he said smiling.

I stood up to go to the counter and make some coffee. Having a Keurig is perfect for times like this. I didn't want coffee so being able to make a single cup was heaven-sent. I prepared the machine and reached over to grab a K-Cup and looked briefly at him at the table. He was looking at me as if he was confused when suddenly shouted.

"KATTHHHYYYYY!" He shouted as his eyes opened wide, "I thought you werrrre uhhhhhh MOM!"

"I am mom, honey. I'm making coffee, remember?" I reminded him.

"Nope! urrr Kathy." He blandly stated, quite clearly to my surprise.

He stood up and approached me slowly, staggering a little. Eventually, he leaned himself against me from behind, wrapping his arms around me. One hand was cupping a breast and I froze. That night with his father flashed before my eyes and I was intensely scared now. Does he really think I'm Kathy? What will he attempt to do to me? What if I say no? Did Kathy say "no" and his violent reaction is why they are not together anymore?

Out of fear, I let him do what he was going to do. His father turned his life around starting the moment I walked into the living room looking like I did the following morning. He nearly burst into tears and groveled at my feet, begging for forgiveness. He said he would do anything and while I've heard enough stories about people saying that and not following through, I kissed him on his forehead and told him that his journey starts that day. I sat him down and told him everything that happened, watching him tear up at nearly every word. I told him I was not telling him to make him feel bad, but simply so he knows and can use that as his fuel to be a better man. He followed through and never drank again. He was rejuvenated again!

I'll see where this goes, so I can see if any of that will even be necessary. As it turns out, I may be the one who needs therapy.

"Kathyyyy... didjoo know that my dick ish harrrd? It'sh beennn u while, ya know." He slurred again, this time while flipping me around. Our faces were within inches of each other. His eyes were not shut or completely open, he was struggling though. I could smell the alcohol on his breath. My only thought at that moment was wondering what his drink was. What the hell? Why would I think of THAT when it looked like he might try to fuck me thinking I was Kathy?

He began stammering about something and I was intent on trying to listen to was he was saying. His hands were no longer on my breast, so my guard was let down. It wasn't until my night gown was around my waist and he looped a finger into my panties that an alarm went off in my head!

"Oh my god!" I remember thinking, "He thinks I'm Kathy and he plans on fucking her... ME! This can't be happening! BUT WHAT IF I TRY TO STOP HIM!? I can't do that again!"

As my mind raced, my natural instincts kicked in and I grabbed the waist band of my panties and prevented him from pulling them down any further. I didn't pull them up, but he was not lowering them anymore. I wonder even today why I didn't pull them up completely. Again, my mind raced. How can I stop this without angering him? Would it even anger him? I wasn't going to take a chance. I had a way out... I thought.

"Mark, it's late and you know I have to be at the store in the morning! Could we do this after work tomorrow?" I cleverly asked, remembering she worked retail in town. I was not prepared for what was about to transpire.

He looked up at me, eyes closed, head down. He suddenly began sobbing horribly. If his father were not out with his friends on a trip, I would have had to shut him up but I let him continue. I rubbed his back while he cried, resting his head on my shoulder. I asked him what was wrong and he sobbed even louder.

As if the intense emotions were not bad enough on him, they seemed to have almost instantly sobered him, kind of like when cops walk into a party and every suddenly is behaving. When he spoke, I could understand every word, but it was clear he was not in the present moment.

"Kathy, you haven't been in the mood for months! What is wrong with me that you don't want me anymore!?" he asked, voice raising at each word then suddenly sobbing again. My heart broke instantly. I felt the sudden rush of hurt flow from my heart, all over my body. So, that is what happened. I wonder who broke it off? I was nearly in tears and couldn't stand to watch him feel so hurt any longer.

"Move your hand, Mark." I whispered into his ear.

He complied, calming a little. Since my hand was still in place, I pushed my panties down my legs and use my legs to finish getting them down and off. I let go of my dress and whispered again in Mark's ear.

"Why are you upset? Did you hear what I said?" I asked, knowing full well where I was taking this.

Mark raised his head and looked at me, clearly confused. I know he heard what I said, but in his state, I could challenge what he knew he heard and change it.

"I said I was waiting for you to fuck me, but you're a little later than I liked so I cannot take all my clothes off for you!" I said while looking him in the eyes. I thought at that moment that there was no turning back... I had to either hope he would not be able to get it up, or just pretend like I did this for him and not me.

Not that I needed it. My husband always took care of me. Maybe I needed to fill the motherly gap once again. It's been about 5 years since he looked to me for answers and now I get another chance to be his anchor. Looking back, though, I think I got a small thrill out of the whole thing because none of the rest of that motherly garbage really even makes sense to me now.

"Mark." I said looking at him, "Do you mind if I run the show tonight?" I asked softly. This had to be plain and boring because odds are he would not even remember it in the morning and I wasn't ready to learn what sexual things he was into.

"Not at all." He said with a smirk.

I paused momentarily to catch my breath. The thought of taking my son's penis out, getting it hard and letting him fuck me was not something I woke up this morning expecting to happen. I needed to quickly figure out this was going to happen. I don't want him seeing... me. Hopefully he can't even get it up. I'm wearing a night gown so maybe I can just raise it enough for him to enter me and get it done.

I reached out and grabbed his belt, pulling him slightly closer. I fumbled with it for a minute, finally getting it undone. I then grabbed the top of his pants and paused again. "Here we go!" I thought. I undid the button and slid the zipper down. His pants feel down to about his knees and he was standing with his boxers exposed to me. I looked down and to my shock he was HARD! This has to be some kind of medical miracle, or maybe the excitement was overwhelming the whiskey dick syndrome that should have been happening now.

I took hold of his boxers on both hips and tugged them down. His dick bounced out of them and pointed directly at me. In the moment, I felt part shamed and part excited. Mostly shamed BECAUSE I was excited. I didn't understand why I was doing this or why my body was responding. Natural sexual instinct is what I told myself to get through it.

I took his dick in my hands and felt his hardness for the first time. He was ready... and so was I. I leaned into him a little.

"I'm in control, remember?" I whispered.

"You know I like that, Miss." He offered. Ok, so he was a little submissive.

I raised my night gown just high enough and pulled him closer to me with his dick. Using my fingers, I slid it between my legs so it rested there. I released my gown so he could not see anything and opened my legs just a little. I remember thinking there was no stopping now. He was ready and I was not prepared to walk away anymore. I gave in and moved my hips back and forth along his dick so that my wetness would eventually coat me, making it easier for his clumsy self to get it in and keep it there while he fucked me.

I was mildly surprised when it was only a couple minutes of me doing that before I knew I was ready for him. He grunted the entire time. I chuckle now wondering if he thought he was fucking me at that point.

"Are you ready?" I asked. "I'm going to put it in and I want you to fuck me."

"I'm ready!" He said a little louder for my liking, almost like a giddy child.

Sighing, I took hold of his dick with two fingers and my thumb and positioned him. "Push in."

He did and to my surprise, slowly. I felt him bury his cock deeper and deeper until he was all the way in and he stopped. I wondered what he was thinking.

"Kathy, you're so tight. I always loved that about your pussy." He whispered while exhaling. I guess I didn't have to wonder.

"I know you do, baby." I responded. "Now, fuck me."

He began to move back and forth. I wish I could have been a fly on the wall. Watching son fuck his mother face to face against the kitchen counter. How long would this last? I wasn't exactly happy about this situation, but I wasn't disgusted. I knew this would be a one-time thing and he would not even remember. I told myself again that I was doing this because this is the motherly thing to do for a son in pain over the loss of his love.

I pulled him close to me and I rested my head on his shoulder. His arms went on either side of me, no doubt bracing himself so as to not fall over and also for better hip movement. I wrapped an arm around his neck and began to coax him to finish.

"Are you going to cum, love? Will you cum on me or do you want to come in my hand?" I asked in heavy breaths as his paced quickened. I knew it was going to be soon.

"I thought you liked me to cum in your mouth?" He asked, also in heavy breath.

Oh, they did THAT. I am NOT going to be doing that tonight.

"I have to go to work, remember?" I chided him playfully.

"Can I cum in your pussy?" He asked.

Oh. I hadn't thought about that angle. What's the worst that could happen? I doubt pregnancy is an issue here, but even so, there's always Plan B. Look at me being the super tramp!

"Oh yes, baby... cum inside me!" I excitedly said.

It was a mixture of role play and actual excitement. The moment had taken me and I guess I had just pretended as if it were my husband fucking me before work. It suddenly happened.

Mark grunted loudly and stopped pumping. I could feel his cock pulsate within me. He was cumming inside my pussy. I ground down on him and squeezed my muscles around his cock. He came fast, but a lot it felt like. I looked around and grabbed a wash cloth since I could feel him getting smaller and slipping out. He was almost out of breath as he took a step back.

"Mom, I think I'm going to pass out!" He said deliriously.

MOM?!?!?! What the FUCK. Did he plan this or... what was going on?! I decided to see what was happening.

"Did you just call me 'Mom'?" I asked, faux angrily.

He jerked his head to look at me. He was confused and thought for a second. "Why would I call you MOM?! That's a little weird, Kathy, even for you. But, I don't feel that great. I'm going to lay down while you're at work, ok? I love you."

I was relieved. "I love you, too! I hope you feel better... will you be up for a blowjob later?" I asked, still playing the role.

"Babes, you know I'm always up for that. Literally." He replied, chuckling at his own joke.

I kissed him on the cheek and sent him to bed. I gathered my thoughts and reminded myself that this will not be happening again. I wiped off as much of his cum as I could and threw away the wash cloth. No way was I going to leave that evidence around. I straightened up my night gown, turned off the lights and went to get my shower. I remember it took me a long time to fall asleep that night as the events that played out went through my head in vivid detail. I finally drifted off to sleep.

The next morning, I awoke around my usual time and since I had already gotten a shower, I didn't need to bother. I had an uneventful sleep considering the night prior. I was glad about that but could not help but replay the events again. I truly was a fucking pervert because I felt myself get wet again thinking of him pumping his cock in and out of me, then depositing his seed in me. My god, what would happen if I got pregnant? No matter, I had nothing planned today so I can go to the pharmacy and take care of that potential problem.

I began to make breakfast as I usually did each morning when Mark got out of bed and quietly stumbled into the kitchen holding his head. I chuckled a little on the inside thinking he must feel awful but also was dying to know what he had on his mind, if anything.

"Good morning! Did you sleep well?" I asked, knowing he probably did.

He looked at me slowly. "My god I drank too much. I don't even remember making it home last night. The Uber guy must've taken his time or something because I remember getting in the car but nothing else." He explained, clearly not remembering what happened in this very room.

"Did you get a shower? That usually helps a little. By the time you're done with that, I'll have breakfast ready and a little greasy food will also help. Until then, take this." I said, handing him about 800mg of Motrin. "You know you have to work today."

"I know. I'll take that and absolutely get a shower. Thanks, Mom, you're always there to take care of me and I can't begin to show you how much I appreciate it." He said, gulping down some water and pills.

"I think you do know how to show me..." I thought to myself, catching my eyes staring at his dick.

Breakfast was uneventful and we carried about our normal routine as we ever did. I was relieved that he remembered nothing. I figured that would be the case, but I also thought he would not be able to get hard as drunk as he was. I guess you're never to old to see something that is contrary to what you always believed.

As I expected, this was indeed a one time event. Or so I thought. I'm not writing a journal because of a single event... he has come home a few other times drunk since this episode with similar results. It's almost 4 AM and I need to go to bed. I'll tell the rest of the story before I sit Mark down and tell him what has been transpiring between us.
