 Something went wrong when I submitted an updated version of another story, and it was uploaded here. This is a revised version of the correct chapter 2.

I describe myself as a wannabe Dirty old man, not because I am one, but because as my best friend Karen keeps telling me, there is no higher accolade and so I should aim to be one.

This is the second chapter in this series. Please read the first chapter before this one.

Many thanks to Romantic1 for all his insight and help - any remaining mistakes are all mine.
