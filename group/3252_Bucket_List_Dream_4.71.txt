 I didn't expect what had happened. I certainly didn't plan it.

"It's every guy's wet dream," Sandra, my wife remarked afterward. 

I smirked. There wasn't any other response that I could offer.

"I guess you just checked off one of your bucket list items," Sandra continued.

"Bucket list!" I thought. A light bulb went off in my head.

I didn't plan what happened at first, but I absolutely planned what happened after that ... sort of.
