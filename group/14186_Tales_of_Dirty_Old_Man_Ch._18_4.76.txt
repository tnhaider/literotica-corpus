 I need to apologize to you for the long wait for this chapter. So much has been happening over the past few months that unfortunately writing had to take a distant second place. 

This is the 18th chapter in this series - I strongly recommend you to read the previous chapters in order, before this one, it's not going to make a lot of sense otherwise.

I can't thank Romantic1 enough for the time he spent reviewing and editing this and the previous chapters. Any remaining mistakes are all mine.
