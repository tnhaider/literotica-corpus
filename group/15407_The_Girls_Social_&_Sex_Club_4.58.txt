This is the story of how I got mixed up with this bizarre Club. This was the first time, I had ever purchased, yet alone used a contact magazine. My ex best man had brought the advert to my attention and suggested that I mught give it a go Yet, I was very nervous as I waited for Sandra my contact, and wondering whether I had done the right thing, or was I perhaps getting into something that I would regret? It had been the advert that had attracted me. After all I thought, no harm in meeting the lady, and well you never know, she might be just what I wanted. The advert had read.
