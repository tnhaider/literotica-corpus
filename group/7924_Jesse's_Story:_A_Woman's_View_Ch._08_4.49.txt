 This is Jesse's story; these will be her words, her thoughts, her emotions. My sole purpose is to present her story to the reader in a readable manner, in an accurate manner, with no editing by me. She made me promise to do this, as she asked, and I promised. I always keep my promises to Jess.

Her Story

"Happy Birthday, baby," Ray said, placing a folder on the table, and giving me a kiss.

It was my fortieth, and I felt damn good about it; I was still my same slender self, I certainly had no complaints about my sex life, as it was incredibly delicious, and rather than mourn my fortieth, I would damn well celebrate it, I had vowed.

"Oh, Ray," I cried when I opened the folder; it had two first-class tickets for a week long cruise through the Panama Canal, ending in L.A. but departing from Miami. Included was a top-end suite, complete with large balcony and every convenience that one could want. 

"This must be costing a fortune," I said, staring at the tickets and all.

"It wasn't cheap, but then, neither am I when it comes to you, Jess," smiling afterwards.

He wasn't lying, I thought, rising to give him a big old thank-you smooch.

Holding me in his arms, tight to his chest, he said, "Jess, we've talked about cruising for what now? Five years? Well, it's time to stop talking and start doing."

"Aye, aye, captain," I said, my insides excited beyond belief.
