 The first shot struck Jennifer under the chin. That one came from Lawrence. She was still yelping when Trent's delivery took her full in the face, filling her mouth and blinding her in an explosion of thick white. She spat and wiped her eyes clear, then pursued her boyfriend, scooping snow as she ran. Trent taunted as he fled, but stumbled knee-deep in a drift.

"Bastard!" She laughed as she pelted him, then pushed him over while he was still off-balance. He pulled her with him and they rolled in a white-powder flurry, till she straddled and pinned him.

"Language, baby!" he chided. "What would the Pastor think?"

"That you deserved it." Her eyes dared him to fight back.

A scream from Kimmie diverted her. The girl had attempted an assault on Lawrence, only to be hoisted upside-down. He dropped her flailing to the ground, holding her there and rubbing snow in her laughing, spluttering face. "You're so mean!" she protested.

He laughed. "I think that's how you like me."

"Now there," Jennifer goaded, "is a guy who's got control of his girl". Trent flipped her over and they wrestled till she disarmed him with a slow kiss on his mouth. "See?" Her breath smoked in the cold. "That's why I'm the boss of you."

"Really?" He stroked her face and smiled. "Don't bet on it."
