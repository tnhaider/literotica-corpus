 When Melissa arrived in Washington, her first instinct was to panic. She'd been there before, of course, but never alone. Actually, she'd never really traveled alone before. Trips from home to college, to visit friends, she'd always had someone flying with her or waiting for her at the airport. But now she was alone. But she calmed herself down and found her way to the taxi stands. In a way, being alone was a blessing. She gave a cab driver the address, an apartment she'd never been before, and she settled into the back seat. 

As the car traveled into the city from the airport, Melissa thought about what it would be like to spend a summer here, or maybe more. Tomorrow she'd have interviews for positions in labs around the city, at universities and government agencies, and they'd want a good answer to "why do you want to spend a summer in DC?" Truth be told, she didn't have one. She had an answer, of course, but not an answer she could give them; DC wasn't St. Louis or Augusta, and that was about all she cared about. No parents, no Matt. Just thinking of him made her almost throw up in the cab. She closed her eyes and banished the thought. She sighed and settled into her seat. She had made it this far; if she could get to their apartment, everything would be ok.
