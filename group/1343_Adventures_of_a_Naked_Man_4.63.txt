 Bill Williams was getting very excited, he was going to go to a party over at Ashley Fragles dorm, the hottest girl on campus. This was absolutely unbelievable. He never thought that she would ever take an interest in inviting him to a party. But here he was staring at an invitation. Bill wasn't exactly considered cool, nor was he particularly good looking and being invited, personally mind you, by one fine hottie like Ashley Fragles was absolutely blowing his mind, he just kept saying to himself, no way, there's no way this is happening to me, good things like this don't happen to me, and then he'd go and read over the invitation once again.
