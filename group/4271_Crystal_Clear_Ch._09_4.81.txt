 This story is part of a continuation of my Road Trip series (see the end of 'Road Trip – California' for a list of the chapters of that series, in order to be read). You need not read that series to enjoy this series. Although real places and celebrity names are used for realism, this story is fiction. Please 'read, enjoy, vote, and comment.'

This chapter will be dramatically enhanced for you if you read my story "Road Trip – Ohio." This story can be found at the author's web page by clicking on the name Romantic1 above.  That said, this is a stand alone story.

Synopsis of This Story Up to This Point: After a cross-country road trip laced with grief, love, incest, and sex, Jim now lives with Crystal Lee and her sister Ellen in Tennessee. Jim has joined Crystal as a top star in country music, a major change in life for Jim. Crystal posed for Playboy in a sex-filled weekend photo shoot. After a busy six months, a New Years orgy on a Caribbean isle, and three busy winter months, Crystal and Jim went to different parts of the world to make two different movies. Just before leaving Jim, Ellen, and Nadia, their Russian housekeeper, had a series of sexual romps. When on the west coast for his movie, Jim reconnected with a love interest from his road trip – Tina Devoe, participated in an orgy with his leading lady Jill Danes, and found a new and additional love interest in Claire. The film crew moved to Nicaragua to film on location, and Jim's leading lady was kidnapped. Jim did a bold and risky rescue, using his skills as a Green Beret from decades earlier. Shooting finished on Jim's movie. He returned to Nashville with Ellen and Claire, they had a passionate week and included Nadia in their sex-filled romp. Crystal arrived home from Europe and joined Jim at well-attended news conference at the airport shortly after she disembarked from her plane. Things went well up until the last question to Jim by the press.
