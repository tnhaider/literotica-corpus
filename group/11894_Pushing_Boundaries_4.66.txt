 This is a fictional story about a couple in the Lifestyle. As an erotic story, the characters aren't practicing safe sex. In real life, on would be foolish to engage in the activities in this story. However, it is a real drag writing stories where the characters are changing condoms between partners and rimming through a dental dams. I only mention this since I've received several irate emails warning me about the perils of unsafe sex. Also, if stories with a bi-male them aren't your cup of tea, don't read any further.
