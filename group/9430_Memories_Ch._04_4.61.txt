 This is part of a multi-chapter story and not a stand alone story; you are recommended to start reading from the first chapter.

Author's notes.

This story is quite light on the sex part and definitely not meant as stroker/written porn. Don't expect many explicit sex scenes. It is about recollections of sexual activity rather than about having sex directly.

Synopsis

A young, pretty woman is found lying unconscious on the road, naked. She is taken to hospital, where a check-up reveals she's had sex with no less than five different men.

Oswald Jones, detective, is in charge of the investigation in this strange case. Together with his colleague Julia, a police counsellor, and his friend Thelma, a news paper journalist, he tries to figure out what has happened to this lady.

During the investigation they find out that this lady is not alone in her ordeal. Oswald and his friends dig in deeper and deeper, to uncover it all.

Chapter 4. More dates.

We spent what was left of the afternoon in the bakery shop, enjoying their cheesecake and just chatting the time away. The day was almost done for anyway, and I really felt bad about her reaction at the ruins. When finished I just took her to the police station's parking lot for her to collect her car and we both headed home.

That Thursday morning I received a chat log in my mail box. The previous evening Julia had logged on to Ms Locatelli's account and contacted Sonar, who apparently was available and readily replied to her messages.
