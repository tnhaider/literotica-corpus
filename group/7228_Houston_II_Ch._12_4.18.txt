A Night at the Club

"What are you going to wear to the . . . err, party tonight, Argie?"

"I'm glad you asked. I spent most of the day shopping, and I think I'll wow them with what I wound up with."

"You do know that you'll be naked for the most part, don't you?"

"Of course I do, darling. But first impressions count for a lot. And I want to impress the women there. Are they all couples? I mean husbands and wives?"

"For the most part, yes, I believe they left room for . . . um, stag members. At least Doctor Coughlin inferred as much."

"Men, I suppose," Argie said from the bedroom.

"Probably, but why exclude additional women?"

"Right," she called out, "It is a men's club, after all."

"Get ready, I'm coming out," Argie called from the interior of their bedroom.

John felt himself stir, and cautioned himself to go easy, for he would be having a long and perhaps difficult night ahead of him.

Argie strode into the living room and John had to look twice to make sure it was her. She wore black. Five inch pumps covered her feet, which were encased in sheer black stockings that ended before her short skirt began. Argie's 24 inch waist was surrounded by a two inch wide black belt. Her belly button and part of her flat tummy were visible below the black lace bustier she wore. The top of the bustier struggled to hold Argie's chest in place. Her breasts were pushed together, forming a cleavage that would attract both men and women like bees to honey. Over the bustier she wore a small unbuttoned jacket that matched the skirt. To complete the outfit she wore black gloves that reached her elbows, and carried a small black handbag.

"Sensational," he said, and meant it.

His erection was all the comment Argie really needed, for she was aglow with desire, and couldn't wait for the evening to begin.

"What's in the purse?" he asked.

"Lipstick and condoms," she replied haughtily, and then giggled.

"Oh, John, I'm so excited. I keep thinking about having three or more men in me at once," she shivered with the anticipation of it, and they both laughed.

"Oh, let me show you why I bought this outfit over another," Argie said, and held the jacket open, revealing her bust in all its glory. Her large brown nipples were visible through the sheer lace bustier, and the sides of her breasts could be seen when she twisted her torso to one side. 

He also noted that she wore a bit more make-up than usual, especially eye shadow and blush. 

"If we weren't pressed for time, I'd take you on the dining room table.

"Maybe later this evening, if we're not totally exhausted," she said with a nervous laugh.

"There's always tomorrow," he said, caressing her left breast.

"No touchee-feelie," Argie said, for she was already highly aroused and knew they were only seconds from hopping on the dining room table.

He backed away from her, sensing her lust matched his own. Two minutes later they were in their car and headed to the club.
