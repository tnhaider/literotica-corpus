 After a two-year stay at the Stateville Correctional Center, Robert Makowski rejoined society as a shell of his former self: quiet, brooding, and obedient. His sentence was uneventful: no gang affiliations, no fights, just day after day of weights, bad food, and insufferable monotony. His big break came one year after his release when he was discovered by Felicia, owner and proprietor of the up-and-coming Studio Trésor.

He was known to Felica as Bob the Doorman and she seduced him ruthlessly. His threatening appearance and unbending loyalty proved invaluable to her as she gradually brought him deeper into her world—one of surprising wealth and power for a humble ex-con like him. Without Felicia he was nothing. As far as he was concerned, she was the only thing standing between his current posh lifestyle and being out on the street.

For years Bob did what Felicia required of him without protest. His latest assignment had him staring at a picture of innocent young woman on his computer in his quest to find information that they could use against her. He saw the implied bullseye of his employer on her face and proceeded as instructed. He made some calls. He assembled information. He passed it on to Felicia.

Bob stewed restlessly in his house on the night of the workshop, knowing full well that Holly was walking into a trap. Snooping on the competition was one thing, and Bob always, if reluctantly, gave Felicia the goods on her foes. But trapping an unsuspecting intern in order to intimidate her or do god knows what with her? It suddenly seemed clear to him what he had to do and his future be damned. He rushed out into the rainy night, hoping there was still time to make things right.
