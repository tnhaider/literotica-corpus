Four for Friday—with a pair of surprises

Andy and I headed for Chicago on the Thursday night before Memorial Day weekend. I drove to his house about 30 miles south of Effingham, picked him up after work and we headed north on I-57. I wanted to arrive at Dene and Rex's Evanston home around 10 PM. We had a good start and with Andy at the wheel I was daydreaming about the foursome I hoped we'd finally have this weekend. I was startled out of my rising horniness by a massive traffic jam. We hadn't even gotten as far as the I-70 exit toward St. Louis! Traffic crawled, or more accurately just stayed stopped, then suddenly surged forward and just as suddenly stopped again. It felt like we were already on the friggin' Dan Ryan!! Andy wasn't surprised--he said that there was construction further on, and that this wasn't particularly unusual. Just after we crawled past the I-70 West exit, we heard an Effingham station report a jack-knifed semi at the I-70E/I-57N interchange. It had triggered a chain reaction of semis and cars in the northbound I-57 lanes. 3 hours later, we finally made it to an exit and pulled off. It was pretty clear that people getting off at exits were the only reason traffic was moving at all.

We found a Culvers Restaurant, had some very fine burgers and fries, and thought maybe things would have cleared by the time we finished. They hadn't.

By then:
