 Here's the finale' of the "Nan Gets a Three-Way" series! There's some adult incest mixed in, so if that bothers you, this might be one to skip. 

I hope, gentle readers, that you've enjoyed the stories. This is my last one; I don't intend to write any more. 

I began writing erotica as a sort of self-designed therapy after losing a life-long friend and lover to cancer. At first, I couldn't stop writing. Words just poured out and it was enormously helpful even if it wasn't particularly skillful. 

That first 9-part series was largely autobiographical with only a few timeline adjustments and name changes. Subsequent stories were largely fantasies based on personalities of the original characters. 

 I'm past the bulk of my grief now and it's more and more difficult to sit down, fantasize, and put words together. 

Thanks for all the nice comments and votes! Stay hornyâ€”get laid!
