 Elly is the Queen of a secret society on Earth that worships their Gods via the sacred act of sex. She has traveled to the planet of her ancestors where her society originated and is about to take the test of Queenship. She is accompanied by 4 bodyguards who are not part of her society, but must guard her as an Ambassador from Earth. However, they have a hard time understanding the culture. They watch in something akin to horror as she tries her best to pass the test and become a Queen of Hedonia.
