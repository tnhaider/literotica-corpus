 Chapter 3. MÃ©nage 'a Trois, with Sandy

"Do you do it with women too, Sylvia?"

Chris knew that under normal circumstances if a man approaches a woman, the woman will think he's coming-on to her behind his partner's back. Even if the man discusses a threesome with his partner sitting beside him, the female candidate will most likely be too embarrassed to speak freely.

On the other hand if he got Sandy to discuss the pleasures of a threesome to Sylvia, all the residual issues might be dissipated, with no further come-on from himself, no misperceived cheating, and with no one being embarrassed.
