Okay, this is my second entry for the 2017 Summer Lovin' competition and it looks like I just scraped this one in before the deadline. Yes!!!! It started life as an old story I came up with a year or two before I started writing on Literotica. I kind of liked it at the time, but I'd put it aside back then. When I was looking for a quick story for the 2017 Literotica Nude Day Story Competition (coz I was working on a bunch of other stories and I didn't have much spare time for a story for the Nude Day competition) I remembered this one. After I hauled it out and looked at it, I kind of shuddered at how badly it was written from way back then, which I guess just goes to show how you can improve your writing if you sit down and work at it, and then I sat myself down and started rewriting it. 

Rewriting a lot -- it started out rather different from the story you're reading here. It didn't make it (sob) for the 2017 Nude Day competition so I recycled it just now for the 2017 Summer Lovin' competition after I finished "Summertime Sadness" -- and if you haven't read "Summertime Sadness", that's my other 2017 Summer Lovin' competition story and go read it after this. Please -- it needs your views and your votes and if you enjoyed "Fingerprints on my Heart", I'm sure you'll get "Summertime Sadness." Anyhow, "The Temptation of Sammi Woo" wasn't a quickie in the end but this is the end result, and here it is. I hope you all enjoy reading it as much as I did writing it and as much as Sammi enjoyed ...well, you'll find out what Sammi enjoyed soon enough. Again, it's a little on the long side, like a lot of my stories here, but then, Sammi does have a lot to enjoy ... and be warned, there's a long lead in before the sex but okay, it's worth it ... Sammi thought so, anyhow ... just pace yourself, guys, okay .... Chloe
