 I believe I've achieved my ultimate goal - I am a Dirty Old Man!

This is the 16th chapter in this series - I strongly recommend you to read the previous chapters in order before this one, it's not going to make a lot of sense otherwise. 

I'm sorry about the long gaps between chapters but it's due to the real world intruding into my writing time. The result of a family crises, plus getting dumped with an ex-colleges project that's 3 months behind schedule.

I can't thank Romantic1 enough for the time he spent reviewing and editing this and the previous chapters.
