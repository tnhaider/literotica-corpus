 This story begins the long-awaited continuation of my Road Trip series also posted on this website (see the end of 'Road Trip -- California' for a list of the chapters of that series, in order to be read). You need not read that series to enjoy this one, although I do make references to events and characters in that story to tie this story and that one together. My plan is to post weekly additional chapters to this story, so check back about weekly. This story is fiction. Please 'read, enjoy, vote, and comment.'
