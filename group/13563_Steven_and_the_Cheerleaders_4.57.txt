 Author's Note: This story came from the 500 word challenge I participated in, that was posted on the Author's Forum (the title was Carpooling Cheerleaders). Later, most all the stories were collected and turned into a submission here at Lit. under the name: Coming Together and titled Transportation Challenge. It is full of 500 word stories by many talented writers here at Lit. I recommend it to anyone. This story idea is my own and I felt the need to expand it. I hope you enjoy. Please vote and comment if you feel so inclined. ~ Thank you, Red.
