 I'm sorry that there has been a long wait for this chapter. I lost my mother recently after a short illness. It's taken me a while to feel like writing again, and I'm not really up to speed yet.

This is the 17th chapter in this series - I strongly recommend you to read the previous chapters in order before this one, it's not going to make a lot of sense otherwise. 

I can't thank Romantic1 enough for the time he spent reviewing and editing this and the previous chapters.
