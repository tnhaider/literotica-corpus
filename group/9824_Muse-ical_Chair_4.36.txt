Friday morning.  Challenge time!  Anybody home?

B: "I'm here, as usual. Did you say ‘challenge?'"

A: "Me, too.  What's up?"

B: "Geez!  What are YOU doing here?  Imp, do I have to share you with him?"

A: "I used to be here all the time, 'til you showed up, bitch.  Now I'm lucky if I get any play time at all."

B: "Which tells me you just weren't satisfying ..."

Enough, you two!

A: "Sorry."

And, yes, I said 'challenge.'  I'm on a multitasking mission ...

B: "Care to elaborate?"

A: "This sounds interesting.  Please continue, Imp."

... and you two are going to help me.

B: "Looks like you're starting without us."

Yeah, well that's part of the challenge.  I have to do three things – write, masturbate, and describe – simultaneously.

A: "Oh, fuck!  I love to watch you touch yourself."

B: "That's becoming rather obvious."

A: "You're staying there, then – in that squeaky old chair at your desk?"

Uh huh.

B: "Time limit?"

None.  Well, I take that back.  I've an afternoon appointment, but the rest of the morning is ours.

A: "Are toys allowed?"


Um – nothing was mentioned one way or the other, so I assume it's permissible.

A: "I'll get the little vibe."

B: "No, you won't.  It died yesterday morning."

A: "How would you know?"

B: "Figure it out, Sherlock."

Would you two PLEASE cooperate?  This is going to take forever if you don't stop sniping at each other.

A: "Well, does the electric one still work?"

B: "Can't you do without?   I mean, I can EASILY get her off without one.  No problem."

ENOUGH!

B: "Sorry, Imp.  What would you like me to do?"

Undress me.

B: "My pleasure."

But don't use your hands.  You, on the floor – on your back.

A: "I like the sound of that."

Wait.  Open this for me first.  I can't do it with one hand.

A: "Do you have to keep one hand on the keyboard at ALL times?"

Hmmm ... I guess not.  I do have to keep writing, though, so it can't be away too long.

B: "Would you help me with your bra clasp, then.  I can't get it with my teeth."

Losin' your touch, lover?

B: "I'll make it up to you.  I promise."

A: "This stuff smells good.  What is it?"

Just some peppermint massage cream.  It tingles a bit.

B: "How's it taste?"

A: "Like peppermint, of course."

B: "Aren't you a bright one?"

A: "I'll put some on my cock, and you can lick it off."

Good idea.  I'd like to watch you two be nice to one another for a bit.

A: "I meant you, Imp."

I don't think I can type and give head simultaneously.  Not well, anyway.

A: "Think she can handle it?  It ain't pussy, ya know."

B: "You won't have any complaints."

A: "Can you see well enough?"

Just fine.  Have at it.

A: "I'd really rather it was you, Imp."

Pretend, then.  That's what we’re here for, isn't it?

A: "I love how you suck my cock."

Then you're gonna love her, too.  She's orally gifted.

B: "You should know!  You want me to get him off or just keep him stoked for you?"

Just get started.  I'll decide later.  Ya know, either I'm gonna have to go back later and add all the capital letters and other stuff that requires the SHIFT key, or I'm gonna get my keyboard all sticky.

B: "Do it later.  You're allowed to edit, aren't you?"

I guess so.  This is a first for me.

A: "First what?"

First time masturbating while writing.

B: "You're kidding!"

A: "Don't talk with your mouth full, sugar."

I'm not kidding.  It's a true multitasking challenge, but I'm up for it.

A: "Swivel your chair sideways, Imp.  I wanna look straight up at you fingering yourself."

Hold her hair out of the way, would you?  I can't see.  That's better.

A: "Damn!  That stuff does tingle, doesn't it?"

B: "Mmmm hmmm."

Don't talk with your mouth full, lover.

A: "You'd better not wait too long to make that decision, Imp, or I'll be making it for you."

Do you need both hands for her hair?  I could use one of yours up here.

A: "It's still got some peppermint stuff on it."

Even better.

A: "Like this?"

Very n-nice.

A: "If you'd scootch forward just a bit more, I could get my thumb inside at a better angle."

Mmmmm 'kay.

A: "Right ... there.  Uh, Imp?  I think you're gonna need to clean your chair."

I know.  I should've put a towel down first.  Too ... late ... now.

A: "Oh, yeah.  You were right.  She IS good.  Oh, fuck!"

Fuck?  Good idea.  Slide up, lover, and straddle him.

B: "I thought you'd never ask."

Nice, huh?  He's quite filling.

A: "You want my other hand now, too?"

Yeah.  Put 'em t-t-together.

A: "Woman, where'd you learn to give head? Damn!"

B: "On the jobs training. Years of it."

A: "And here I thought you only liked pussy."

B: "Where'd you get THAT idea?"

Not from me. You both know I don't kiss and tell.

A: "Well, you're with Imp so much ..."

B: "She wants me."

That's an understatement.

B: "And the feeling's ... Oh, damn. Yes! ... mutual."

Like you have a choice! You're prisoners of my imagination.

B: "W-w-willingly. Mmmm."

A: "Seconded. Oh, that's vvvverrrry nice. I'm not gonna last much longer."

B: "Almost ... there ... myself."

I'll take over up here. I want your hands on her tits now.

A: "Can do. How's it – um – coming up there, Imp?"

Not bad at all. Getting hard to ... concentrate, though. The floor show's rather d-d-distracting.

B: "Your hands are ... so ... sssslippery."

A: "Imp juice."

B: "Move your hand, Imp.  I want some from the source."

Can't say no to THAT.  C'mon, lover.

A: "Oh, fuck!  What a view.  Best seat in the house."

B: "Mmmm.  I disagree."

A: "Don't talk with your mouth full.  Still writing, Imp?  I don't hear you typing."

Huh?  Oh, shit.  There's a string of letters on the screen: ddddddddddddddd ddddddddddddd ddddddddddddddddddddd ddddddddddddddddd ddddddddddddddd ddddddddddddddddd ddddddddddddddddddd dddddddddddddddddddd ddddddddddddd ddddddddddd dddddddddd ddddddddddd ddddddddddd ddddddddddddd dddddddddddd.  Two whole pages of 'em.

A: "Well, that's writing ... sort of."

Guess I lost focus.  Fuck, that ... feels ... incredible.

A: "I agree."

B: "M-m-me, three."

Don't ya just LLLLLLLLOVE teamwork?  Up here, lover.  I want you kissing these lips now.

B: "Oh, wow!  You look like you're about to melt off that chair."

Another good idea.  Who needs a squeaky old chair?  I can type from my knees.

A: "Mmmmph."

B: "Don't talk with your mouth full."

A: "Mmmmph."

B: "That's it.  Rrrrrright ... there.  Oh, damn.  Damn!"

Look into my eyes.  I love to watch you come.

B: "I'm yours."

Yesssss.

A: "Mmmmph!"

I think he likes being our teeter-totter.

A: "MMMMPH!"

B: "Oh, I'm sure of it.  His cock just told me so."

Shit!  I typed 'rwwrwe-rirrwe.'  Must ... must ... ed-ed-edit.

B: "Your turn, Imp.  Can I lick here now?  Is it fully healed?"

Oh, god, yes!  Yes!

B: "Let go now.  Your story's finished."

But our story's ... just … beginning.

A: "Give me 10 minutes, and I'll be ready for the next chapter."

B: "Who said you were invited?"

A: "Bitch."

Enough, you two!
