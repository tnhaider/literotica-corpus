 Lena and I continued to meet for tea and talk. You can imagine that we naturally talked a lot about the resort, the nights shared in the cabin, and the sex with our husbands since that weekend. "I think I could not have felt any more refreshed, any more sexually revived than I am now," I told her when I reviewed all the changes Jacob and I had enjoyed since that accidental discovery of their nude picture.

"You make me happy when you say that," Lena said. "I think I've seen how you've changed, but it's nicer to hear you say it out loud."

"And I would say that Jacob and I already had a satisfying sex life, but this is something else."

"I agree. It's always been wonderful for Nate and me too."

"So it's never gotten old or routine for you two?"

"Nope, so far, there's always been something new to excite us and make us keep playing with naked friends. And by the way, we have you and Jake to thank for a lot of our latest fun."

Almost too mischievously, I asked, "So what's next?"

"Well aren't you the hottest little dark horse, pushing me to find new pleasures." We both laughed, and I admit it was uncharacteristic of meâ€”or would have been uncharacteristic not that long before. "I have an idea, if you and Jake are game."

"I think I won't ask for more details," I replied. "It can be more fun if it's a surprise."

That surprise was more than I would ever have anticipated. In part, that surprise was set up when Jacob's father had a recurrence of heart problems that put him in the hospital. With Jacob gone to help his mother in the meantime, I was on my own at the office and at home. Lena was sympathetic, saying, "I hope his dad gets well soon so Jake can come home soon too. But, if you're alone, all the more reason for you to come over."

Before he left, Jacob had told me he expected I might go over to the neighbors' house, and he added, "Just remember all the details from the spa to tell me later." If not explicit permission for anything, he certainly didn't tell me not to do anything.

So there I was at Lena and Nate's house, sharing a casual dinner of pizza and wine. Of course, some of the conversation was about Jacob's parents. I told them what fine in-laws they had been, and what a dutiful son Jacob was. Soon enough, though, Lena turned the conversation to what I had asked before.

"You wanted to know what's next, and I told you I had an idea. Do you want to hear it?"

"I think I'll stick with my previous response and let you surprise me."

"See," she said to Nate, "I told you Liz was a true adventurer." Turning back to me, she said, "Come upstairs, and we'll get you ready."

Maybe I should have asked more questions then, especially without Jacob to share in whatever I was getting into. I didn't ask anything, though, and I willingly went upstairs with them. And I willingly followed them into their bedroom, and I willingly let them undress me completely.

Being nude was not new to me, but being the only one nude was a bit unnerving, especially without Jacob there. Not only that, Nate had helped Lena take off my clothes while I just stood there. In doing so, neither of them was careful with their hands. With both of them taking one bra strap apiece, they took the opportunity to let their hands lightly sweep over my nipples. My panties went down with Lena's hand casually brushing over my bottom and Nate's hand passing through my pubic hair.

Even when they moved me back so I could lie on their bed, I felt only a bit of anxiety and remained compliant. I didn't notice the towel on top of the bedspread, placed there as if in anticipation of their plans for me. Nate left the room, and Lena sat next to me, encouraging me to relax, to enjoy what my body was feeling. As she spoke, she was gently running her hands along my arms, over my forehead. I was not that surprised when her hands then moved over my chest, between my breasts to my stomach, over my hips and down my legs. And I was not surprised when her hands trailed back up my body, this time touching my breasts again, circling my nipples, and finally reaching for my pubis. As if to tell her I was enjoying the light massage, I let my legs open more to allow her hand easier access to my vulva.

"Hmm, good," was all she said about the moist lips she did not immediately explore more deeply.

Nate returned, now wearing only his briefs, bright red with an obvious bulge held within. He was carrying a few items I didn't register right away. Lena's touching had led me to closing my eyes, and I barely opened them except to see him nearly naked before closing them again to accept whatever further pleasures they wanted to share with me.

I didn't look, but I knew Lena was undressing too. Removing her shirt and shorts left her topless, and a later glance informed me that her string panties were almost a match in the red color with Nate's.

At first, Nate joined Lena in the light massage. It should have been a serious escalation of my intimacy with them, letting Nate touch me all over. With my eyes closed, I could perhaps tell myself that I didn't know for certain whose hands were on my breasts or between my legs, but I knew. And I not only didn't resist, I enjoyed.

They must have figured I was sufficiently relaxed, because Lena kept humming a pleasant sound and stroking my upper body, while Nate began the next step. Lena whispered, "You're in good hands. Just feel good." I suddenly felt my pubic hair being tugged, and before I could react, the tension of the pulled hair was released by a snipping sound. Again and again, Nate pulled a tuft of hair and snipped it off, and I knew my surprise. I opened my eyes for a moment, calmly without any hint of alarm, and smiled at Lena. Looking down at Nate, I smiled again and opened my legs wider, silently giving them my assent.

Once my pubic bush was shortened, he used the scissors to trim even more, placing the cool blade against my tender skin and carefully cutting the hairs back. I knew the next step was begun when I felt the warm washcloth rubbed over my vulva. The fact that Nate was doing this did not upset me in the least by then, and I didn't care that he was seeing my sex so openly. After all, I knew my vagina was going to be even more exposed within minutes, and my cooperation was freely granted.

The shaving cream came next, and I worried only briefly that the razor would hurt. Nate's careful strokes were light, though. He would gently use one hand to press and pull my skin taut and, with feathery strokes, pass the razor over the spot. In the pulling, my labia had to be opened, even touched. Still, I felt no scratches or any kind of discomfort at all. No discomfort from the razor, that is, for when Nate turned me over and held the cheeks of my bottom apart so he could get the few hairs that strayed toward my anus, I did feel a tinge of embarrassment. It did not last. I was on my back again, legs still open wide. Lena ran her hands down my stomach and in between my legs to check on Nate's work, and my surprise gift was complete.

"Take a look," Lena told me.

Nate said, "Come in the bathroom. There's a mirror."

Walking between them, the only one completely nude, I would have felt like a patient in some treatment center, except for the fact they were wearing only underpants. In front of the mirror, I discovered my vulva's true character. It had been covered by my hair for so long, and I never closely examined its shape and appearance. So I expected mine would resemble Lena's clean, narrow slit. Indeed, mine was almost shockingly clean, and not one trace of hair, not even stubble, was visible. However, instead of such a tight line, my inner labia parted my outer labia some. Rather than one straight line, it looked more like the shape of a hairpin, two parallel lines close together, meeting in a tight little curve at the top. My vulva also looked a shade redder than the surrounding skin of my stomach and upper thighs.

Standing next to me, Lena pushed her panties off. Side by side, we looked at ourselves, and she said, "Two of a kind, that's what we are. Both nude, both shaved, but both so different, so two of a kind. Do you like it?"

I had been silently going along with them, but I spoke up then. "I love it. You and Nate have given me another fresh look at myself. My body has become even more fun for me, and I have you to thank for it."

"Fun is what we think of first too," Nate said.

I joked, "Of course, I suppose your mother will not approve if I show up like this."

Lena laughed, "Let her say what she wants. I sometimes don't think she really cares. Besides, dad and all the other men will love it, even if they don't say so."

Nate took the occasion to snap a couple pictures of Lena and me side by side. I faced the camera to pose with her and said, "This will let Jacob see me in a new way too."

"I don't think he'll need a picture for that," Lena said. "I mean, won't you show him your shaved pussy before you show him a picture?"

"I'm not thinking only of my shaved parts," I replied. "I want him to see me, my face and my eyes and my smile. All of those parts show me now and won't be as fresh in a few days."

"I bet if he was here, he'd do more than just look."

"Even if he didn't want to do more than just look, I'd want to do more than just be looked at."

"We don't have stay in front of the mirror or take more pictures," Lena said. She took my by the arm again and led me back toward the bed. This time, she tossed the towel aside and pulled the blankets down. She looked at me and said, "We don't have to stop playing if you feel like playing more."

I knew Nate was behind me, so I could not see his face, whether he was as surprised as I was. Before the evening started, I anticipated that we all might wind up naked in the spa. Even without Jacob along, I thought that would be acceptable fun. Standing there near the foot of their bed, I felt caught in a strange episode.

In a way, my life since finding out about Nate and Lena and nudism had been proceeding in episodes: letting Jacob take pictures, going to the resort, joining Nate and Lena in the spa, joining her relatives for working out, going back to the resort and having sex in the same room with Nate and Lena, and just that evening allowing them to shave off all of my pubic hair. Of course, all the later events followed from the prior events, but I felt each one was a disconnected, separate episode in my sex life. So there I was, in the middle of their bedroom, completely naked with the lights on, like I had wandered in and been found by them. In this episode, I was unsure of what else would be acceptable fun. I knew that, if Jacob were there, I would want to get in the bed with them. I knew I would want that even if it would mean going further than making love side by side with our own partners.

Lena said, "We don't have to keep Jake out of this. There will be another time we can play again, and with him too. If the three of us play now, the four of us can play then. If the three of us don't play more now, the four of us still can play then. Either way, the four of us can play then and then again and again as much as we want."

She was holding her hand out to me. Nate remained behind me, not pushing me one way or the other. I moved slightly closer, turned to look back at Nate and see the bulge in his pants, and turned back to Lena. A new episode then proceeded. Taking her offered hand, I said, "I liked the way you two were touching me before." Saying that softly but still aloud, in my mind I was hearing myself say, "You're going to do this. You're really going to do this."

Lena smiled, pulled me gently toward her and had me lie on the bed again. "We can do whatever you like," she whispered. I thought Nate might dim the lights, but he just joined us on the bed.

"I like whatever, all of whatever." My consent was then as clear as the lighting. We weren't hiding anything from each other. The two of them were on either side of me. Lena placed my arms above my head, and Nate set my legs apart. I closed my eyes again and gave myself up to their soft touches. I imagined Jacob there, telling me, "TLW."

This time, I could not tell myself that I didn't know whose hands were touching me. I was fully aware of Nate on one side of me, and I was fully aware of four different hands on my body at once. Those hands explored my body chastely at first, concentrating on my face, my shoulders, my stomach, my legs. They lulled me into a state of relaxation, and then they raised me out of that state into one of expectation. Their hands did this to me by trailing over my breasts, lightly rubbing my nipples, running between my thighs so that the back of their hands would brush against my vulva. And then their hands satisfied that expectation, raising me then to a state of yearning. It was Nate's that first cupped my moist sex, lingered there to let a finger sweep over my labia. Lena's hands followed and did the same, and then they took turns, each probing my labia, pushing a finger and then two or three inside me. When Lena had her fingers in me, Nate would lean over and kiss and lick my breasts. When he had his fingers in me, Lena would take his place on my breasts with her mouth.

My arms stretched out above me, and I then reached for Lena and Nate. For the first time, I felt her small breasts and pressed my palms against her hard nipples. Likewise, I let my other hand feel Nate's chest, and when he bent over me to lick my breasts again, I reached behind him and slipped my hand into his pants, squeezing his bottom. I had touched him before in the showers at the resort, but this seemed naughtier, and I felt like a teenaged boy getting his hand in a girl's panties for the first time.

The two of them pressed their sensuous exploration of my body. Nate trailed his kisses down my stomach, and I let go of his bottom so he could continue lower on me. Stretching, I lifted my hips, the better to welcome his mouth over my sex. The sensation was exhilarating. His tongue was like a finger, parting my labia, probing my vagina, and feathering my clitoris.

When he lifted his face, my hips raised a bit more, like I wanted to press myself against his mouth and hold him there. My pleasures were not suspended for long. Lena moved between my legs, and her tongue lapped at my wet opening, finding every sensitive nerve to electrify. It was with her mouth pressed to my vagina that my first orgasm finally broke and made me cry out.

After such a release, I settled back into my bliss. I knew that Nate quickly turned Lena onto her back and began licking her sex, very pleasingly from the sound of her own cries. I turned on my side to reach over and lightly touch her breasts, flattened except for their firmly prominent nipples. With that minimal assistance from me, Nate soon brought Lena to a loud orgasm in which she raised up and almost folded in half over the back of Nate's head.

When she fell back next to me, Nate rolled over on her other side. Eventually I complimented her orgasmic coil, saying, "That yoga sure has made you flexible. I'm going to have to keep up with it myself."

She shifted closer so she could kiss me, and we stayed in that languorous state for a while. She told me, "Your body needs no work. Your breasts are so different, so big and soft. We love them." Then we were quiet again. When several minutes had passed, she lifted her head and turned toward Nate. She sat up and slipped over him so that he was between us, and she asked, "You want to help?"

I did not need to ask what she meant. I sat up and joined her in the same kind of gentle massage with which they had pleasured me. Running my hands over his chest and stomach and legs was fun, knowing we were teasing him, deliberately avoiding the hard presence still trapped in his underwear. We did not tease him for long, though, and given a silent nod from Lena, I ventured to touch that bulge, to press it, and to feel it full length.

"Do it," Lena whispered to me, and pressed his encased erection more, making it stretch up until the head peeked above his waistband. I felt the wet tip and delayed no more. Grasping the elastic of his pants, I pulled them down and off. Without waiting more, I finally held his penis in my hands, holding it up, stroking it, admiring it as the beautiful object it was.

Lena leaned over to lick it, so I held it for her, moving it one way or the other as she brought her tongue up one side and down along the other. Then I held it so it was more pointing at her, and Lena took the offer and put her mouth over Nate's erection, bringing her lips as far down his shaft as my hand. Without letting go, I held him upright for her until she reached for his penis herself.

Lena continued her sucking, and I wondered if she would let him shoot his semen in her mouth or if she would pull away so I could see his orgasm. Instead, she pulled away and pointed his penis at me. I looked at it, still admiring it. Glancing at Nate, I saw he was ready for whoever would finish him. Turning back to his hardness, I heard Lena again, whispering, "Do it."

Letting go of any hesitation was exciting. When the tip of his penis met my lips, I tasted another man for the first time. His erection was wet, and it easily slipped past my lips and pushed its way deeper in my mouth. I enjoyed learning how the ridge around the head of his penis was more pronounced than Jacob's, while the shaft was slightly thinner. That it was a bit shorter did not make much difference because I could not take all of it in my mouth anyway.

At first, Nate was doing the pushing, but I soon pressed him down and began moving my mouth up and down on his hard shaft. I reached for his scrotum and felt his large, loose testicles, another new sensation. By then, I was determined to finish him, to make him come and shoot his semen down my throat. Fondling his testicles helped, and my mouth did the rest. Once more, he pushed himself up, forcing his penis deeper into my mouth. With a groan, he let himself burst inside me, and I tasted him anew.

Nate reached for my breasts and squeezed me, pulling me down to where he could kiss me too. Lena joined in, getting her lips between us, kissing us both, the three of us releasing our shared ecstasies and tossing ourselves around each other on the bed. If our pleasures before were communicated in whispers and soft sounds, we were then loudly expressing our joy, rolling, tangling, tickling, slapping, shrieking, and laughing.

At one point, I was on top of Lena, and Nate rolled on top of me. His erection had returned to full strength and was nestled against my bottom. We all got quiet, and Lena must have known what I felt. She looked up at me and whispered, "You don't have to ask. It's still whatever."

I kissed her again and looked back at Nate. He perhaps thought I was about to disentangle myself from them. When he raised himself, though, I did not move to get away from their embrace. Instead, I simply raised my hips with my knees straddling Lena. I turned to Nate again and nodded. He waited a moment, so I said it aloud, "Do it, take me this way."

Looking down at Lena again, I shifted forward so my hanging breasts could brush against her face. Lena picked up my wish and began to lick and suck on them. The feeling was intense once more, and it was only getting more so. Nate had moved behind me, he had kissed and rubbed my bottom, and he had reached underneath me to ply my wet labia. As Lena aroused my nipples, Nate finally ceased his brief foreplay. Looking me right in the eye, Lena could tell the exact moment that he pushed his penis past my labia and deep into my vagina. Her own eyes told me she was as excited as I was.

His erection was different inside me, the movements, the way my vagina contracted around it, the sounds he made. The occasional slap of his scrotum against the back of my thighs was another new sensation. I loved it all. No doubt, Nate was highly keyed up, and despite his previous orgasm, his second inside me did not take long in coming. I held him inside, moving my hips slightly side to side and back and forth, extending the feeling for as long as possible. Lena was hungrily sucking my breasts, and my own orgasm started in two places, creating a circuit between my breasts and my vagina. The electricity ran the circuit, a jolt through me and then continued to tingle for several seconds.
