 He was standing in a dark hallway, lit only by the light from the street lamp coming through the window, and a light frame around the door to the master bedroom. It was surreal, as if there was another world behind that door. He inched his way towards it, hearing his own heart beat, his eyes getting more and more accustomed to the darkness of the house. He knew what was behind that door; it was actually his plan, his dream, his fantasy. The closer he got the louder and faster his pulse got. He could hear her. Her, his wife of short 3 years. He loved her from the moment he met her, and now she was with someone else. And it was his idea. What was he thinking?

They met in their late twenties, both good looking people, both from different worlds and backgrounds. He, Phillip, was born in Canada and came to California as a youngster with his parents, who moved with the company his dad was working for. Always an athlete, Phillip was well built, 6'4", and all the muscle he could put on during his high school and college years, playing any and all sport possible. He never had a problem with the ladies, his looks and personality made sure of that, he enjoyed the sun and parties as any other male does in that part of their lives. She, Maya, was born in Japan, to a mixed couple of white business man and Japanese beauty. She moved to California to go to college. Her dad, now back in the US after divorcing her mom few years after she was born, feeling guilty somewhat, made sure she was taken care of, and attended the best schools in the state. Now a doctor, Maya was working for hospital in a major city, being independent and proud of it. The mix of races did wonders with her body and personality. At 5'4", 100 lbs, long dark hair, slightly slant eyes, beautiful face and body to die for, she never had a problem attracting attention by anybody that passed her. Both men and women took a second look at her, women mostly in envy, even though some lusted for her just as the men did. Her personality was a great mixture as well, friendly and pleasant, yet guarded and shy.

Their first meeting was strange for both of them. They were both extremely attractive and yet both had a hard time finding partners. Not just some good fuck, but partners for life. Both occupied with their work, Maya in the hospital and Phillip with his own construction company neither had the time nor the energy to look for that special someone. It all started with Cindy, who knew Phillip from her college days, always having a crush on him, but got pregnant and married before she could pursue it any further. And now she worked with Maya in the hospital as a head nurse in her department, and since they were the same age, soon they became good friends. She ran into Phillip one day at the bank and got an idea, after finding out that he was single and available.

"You have to meet my friend I think you will really like her!" She said as they stood in line.

"I don't know I'm not into blind dates much." Yet another fix-up.

"No I'm dead serious, you have to meet this girl, trust me." Cindy insisted.

Phillip took a long look at Cindy. She was very pretty, just as he remembered. He was a little sorry he never went out with her, but before he could make a move, she was married. What a shame.

"I don't know C, I don't have time to experiment." He hoped this will work, but new better.

"Nonsense, give me your card, I'll call you later and set it up." She stood in front of him, looking up in his eyes, her hand extended waiting for the card.

He looked down in her blue eye, smiled lightly as he fished a card from his shirt pocket. She took the card and put it in her purse. They stood in the line just thinking for a while.

"So what is she like?" Phillip broke the silence.

Cindy smiled and looked up again: "Can't tell you, you have to experience her, it's not just her looks." She looked past him for a little while and added:

"I'll tell you one thing. I'm in love with her and I'm not into women." Her face was flush and she wasn't smiling. The realization hit her more than it him.

She isn't joking, Phillip thought. This just might be interesting. 

They said their good byes and went their separate way. Phillip was almost ran over, as he stepped into the street just thinking about his conversation with Cindy, was she for real?

Meanwhile, Cindy got back to the hospital, and met Maya at the front door coming back from lunch.

"Do I have a dessert for you." Cindy beamed.

"What did you do this time," said Maya, remembering the time, when Cindy openly flashed her panties to a table full of guys opposite to theirs. Dessert in Cindy's dictionary meant something crazy and usually, it had to do something with sex.

"No, not me but you might soon." Cindy smiled as she related her conversation with Phillip to Maya. 

"You are out of your fucking mind, there is no way I'm going on a blind date. Who is this guy anyway?"

Cindy described Phillip to her, his looks, his company, everything she new and some she didn't. The approach to pursue them was very different. Phillip had to be kept in dark, let his imagination do the job for her, and Maya had to be convinced with details. Funny how that works. 

"Come on it's only a dinner, you need a night off anyway, and you just might have a good time." Cindy was looking at her with a wicked smile.

"I guess you're right, it's not like we're getting married." 

"Yet!" Cindy pitched in with a smile which earned her a smack in a shoulder from Maya.

"So when it's good for you?" Cindy asked as they got out of the elevator.

"Oh, I don't know, next year?" It was Maya's turn for a smack in a shoulder.

After a further exchange Maya agreed on Saturday night dinner. She still wasn't sure about that, but Cindy was right, she needed a night out and some company other than her cat. Cindy called Phillip and gave him the date specs, which he accepted with a grunt. He told her what restaurant he had in mind and Cindy told him to be there at seven sharp. Phillip wanted to know about her a little more but hit a dry well. He will just have to see.

"Ok, bye Phee, you guys will be great together."

"If you say so. Hey wait, what's her name?" He almost forgot about that.

"Oh yea, that might help, her name is Maya."

"Maya, hmm, well thanks I guess." Why was he going through with this? Maybe he hoped Cindy's friend would look as good as Cindy did. 

Saturday came slowly for both of them, but it was time to go and so they did, Phillip wondering about his mysterious date and Maya hoping that at least half of what Cindy said about Phillip was true.

He got to the restaurant five minutes early and made sure, they would bring his date to his table when she arrives. He sat down and ordered Jack Daniels straight, to kill the time.

Maya was ten minutes late. Not that she wanted to make an entrance or anything; the traffic was a killer, so she stepped in to the restaurant and looked for a single guy standing around. Maybe he left. She didn't know if she should be happy about that idea or sad. She really looked forward to a night out.

Phillip sat at his table, sipping the bourbon, looking for a desperate woman that might be his date. All of a sudden an angel came in. Dark hair, beautiful as waterfall at night, elegant, and radiant. He sat there, his mouth half open with his glass half way to his mouth, stuck like a statue of adoring lover. He froze in time, until she looked at him, more his direction that is, but their eyes met. Second maybe less, but it sure felt like everything stopped around them. Phillip closed his eyes and whispered to himself. 'God, please, let it be here.' He opened his eyes and saw her talking to the front desk waiter. 'Oh and God, make her smart too.' He was down this road before. He dated some beautiful women and girls, but aside from sex, there was nothing he could talk to them about. He knew a lot of guys like that, too, but he wasn't dating guys so that didn't bother him. He didn't want to just fuck somebody; he wanted a relationship, friendship, partnership. Sure real beauty is on the inside but if you can't get it up, it can go only so far. 

'That must be the guy.' She thought as she looked him briefly in the eyes, he was as good looking as Cindy promised, no better, because Maya didn't believe her. She painted a different picture in her mind, probably to avoid disappointment. 'God, please, let it be him.' She turned to the waiter, who just finished talking with some other customer. She glanced back at the man. 'Oh and God, please make him look in my eyes.' She has been down This road before. What is it with man and their fascination with women breasts? Not that she had too much in that department, but they were nice and round and matched her small form. All the guys she went out with thought with their dicks or something. Yes there were exceptions, of course, but they were either 20 years older or turned out to be gay. 

"Hi, I'm meeting a friend for dinner tonight, and I'm a little late." She smiled at the waiter.

"Let's see, do you know his name?" The waiter greeted her tits with smile. 'Seeeee!'

"Phillip."

"Phillip....?"

"I don't know his last name." Maya said blushing.

"Oh, well what's your name then?"

"Maya Smith."

"Yea, Maya, here Mr. Johnson's table. Please, follow me."

They made their way to his table. Yes, God does exist, at least partly for now. And sure enough, they stopped at his table. Phillip stood and extended his right hand. She took it and smiled.

"Hi, glad to meet you, I'm Phillip."

"Hi, Maya."

The waiter adjusted the seat for her and looked one more time down her blouse before walking off.

'Dipshit,' Phillip thought as he looked at Maya. She was so pretty. Her green eyes looked almost unreal. There was a little uncomfortable silence before Phillip said:

"Cindy sure was right."

"How is that?"

"She didn't tell me anything about you. She said it wouldn't do you justice that I need to experience you." He smiled.

She blushed lightly and smiled as well.

"Well she was dead on about you."

"I would ask what she said but I don't want to spoil my dinner." 

"Should we order?"

They talked. The whole dinner was a great conversation about everything, politics, history, fashion, music, Japan, Canada, California. As they finished and started to leave, Phillip finished his glass of whine and looked at Maya. 

"It just hit me. We didn't talk about the weather."

"Excuse me?"

"Well I just can't remember one first date I had that I didn't have to talk about the weather."

"Oh, yea, well I guess that's good." Maya said knowing well what he meant.

"Very good, indeed. But it sure is nice out today, so if you wouldn't mind I would like to take a walk with you, unless you have some other plans."

She looked up and met his eyes staring right into her. The whole dinner she tried to catch him looking at her tits, but either he was really good at hiding his glances or he was gay. Now a walk, she was expecting a club or hotel, but not a walk really. 

"That would be great."

Phillip paid and out they went. The restaurant was right on a pier, so the walk was destined to be by the ocean, which neither one of them minded. After a little time and some more talk, Phillip took his jacket off and put it around Maya's shoulders. 

"It's getting a little chilly, don't want you to catch a cold because of me."

"Thank you." After a brief silence Maya added:

"Can I ask you a personal question?"

"Sure shoot, I have no skeletons." Mike smiled although he did get a little nervous.

"Are you gay?"

"Excuse me?"

"Well the whole night, you didn't look at my tits, you are handsome, smart, funny, well off, and yet you are single. It's just unusual. Sorry if I offended you."

"No not at all. I guess I better come clean then. I am gay."

Maya put her head down and tear formed in her eye. Can't she just find a decent straight guy?

"Well I should clarify that a bit." Mike said smiling down at her.

"A what?" She looked up at him with the tear running down her cheek. 

"Well I'm a lesbian, I just can't help it, I love women."

It took a little bit for her to register his words. She started hitting him playfully in his chest, laughing: "You idiot, and I went for it."

He put his hands around her and pushed her to him with her hands still on his chest, now crushed between their bodies. 

"I knew, the moment you walked into the restaurant that you are absolutely beautiful. Did I look at your tits, you bet. Did I try to look up your skirt to see your legs and maybe more, absolutely. But that's not what I'm after. I want someone to talk to, someone to dream with, share my everyday with and more."

She kept her eyes locked with his and the tears started rolling down her face again. He leaned over and kissed them off, and then kissed her on the lips. Slowly first, and then she took a charge and started wildly kissing him in his bear hug, melting in his hands.

After the long kiss they parted to catch a breath and Phillip looked at Maya again and grinned.

"And if you are as passionate in bed as you kiss, then I marry you today."

She smiled and kissed him lightly, freed her hands and pulled his head down and whispered in his ear:

"Why to wait for bed to find out?"

His dick was hard in an instant and he lifted her like a piece of foam, she wrapped her legs around him, which caused her skirt to ride up around her waist. He set her down on the railing separating the ocean and the boardwalk, all the time passionately kissing everywhere he could reach. 

"Fuck me." Maya whispered.

He stopped kissing her and looked in her eyes. She was lost, gone to her own sexual world. Phillip unzipped his fly and fished out his dick aching for some action. He spit in his and wetted the tip to help ease it in. He didn't have to worry about that, as he soon found out. Maya's panties were soaked. He positioned his dick at the entrance to her pussy and started to sink in. Maya's eyes flew open. He was big, he was stretching her small pussy to its limits seemed like. And he still kept pushing and going deeper. The feeling being publicly fucked by a man she hardly new, who had a really good size cock was something that gave her a good orgasm, even though Phillip wasn't all the way in. 'It won't fit.' Maya was lost and so was Phillip. Her orgasm caused her pussy to get even tighter. He stopped pushing in and pulled out just to push all the way in. Maya shrieked and bit Phillip on his shoulder. It was intense.

Just then some people walking their dog passed by. Some other people passed by a little bit later as well but nobody said anything, either from disgust or envy. A lady on an evening jog went by, stopped, turned around and quietly came back to the oblivious couple fucking on the railing of the boardwalk. She sat down on a bench opposite to them and watched them fucking. She reached down between her legs under her running shorts and started fingering her quickly moistening pussy. 

Phillip was pumping in Maya's pussy slow and steady, making sure to alternate his strokes and direction of his cock. Maya was in heaven, not paying attention to anything but her building orgasm. Once it hit she went limp and rested on Phillip's shoulder, she opened her eyes and was staring at a women in her late thirties, blond, in tight running shorts and sports bra, flat stomach, and tits similar to hers. She was fingering herself while Phillip fucked her. All of a sudden Maya's orgasm hit out of nowhere, and again the world exploded around her. Phillip was holding back with all his will power but this time he just couldn't stand the heat and tightness of her pussy. He shoot his load into his new lover, and as he decided, while entering her for the first time, his future wife. They stayed in the position for some time catching breath. All of a sudden someone pulled Phillip's head to the side and lower and kissed him on the lips. She then proceeded to reach Maya's mouth and she kissed her as well, although a tongue invaded Maya's mouth and soon the two women were kissing passionately. Watching Phillip's dream in front of his eyes, was amazing and his dick, still berried in Maya's pussy, started to regain its stiffness and soon he was pumping in Maya again. The stranger ended her kiss, feeling the fucking to resume, and looked at both of them.

"Thank you so very much, this was great."

She turned to walk away but Phillip caught her hand and pulled her back to them.

"Stay!"

Maya looked surprised at Phillip, but he just kept on fucking her. He grabbed her blouse and ripped it open, sending buttons flying everywhere around them. He pushed Maya's bra over her beautiful tits and freed them for the world to see. He looked at the stranger and said:

"Suck 'em, Suck her tits!"

And she did. Phillip pushed her sports bra over her tits and started playing and pinching her nipples. She started moaning into Maya's as she did the same thing with her mouth. Phillip leaned over and started kissing Maya again while his hand stopped playing with the strangers nipples and moved into her running shorts where he quickly inserted two of his fingers into her wet pussy. Surprised, she bit Maya a little in her nipple, but didn't object to Phillip's probing fingers. After more kissing he removed his hand from the stranger's pussy and broke the kiss with Maya while still slowly pushing in and out of her. With her eyes still closed and her lips halfway parted, she waited for his mouth to return. She was surprise to find his fingers on her lips and even more so when she flicked her tongue over them and tasted woman's pussy on them. Her eyes flew open and she stared at her lover with alarmed question in her mind. All of a sudden Phillip slammed his dick hard and fast deep into her. She opened her mouth in surprise and as a reaction to a sudden pain and fullness in her body. But before she could react any further, Phillip shoved his two fingers coated with the stranger's pussy juice into her mouth. She closed her mouth around his fingers as he slammed into her again, she started sucking on his fingers getting used to another woman's taste. It was slightly different from hers, and it was mixed with the woman's sweat. Another wave of pleasure hit her due to all the new and exciting things she was experiencing. 

Phillip pulled on the stranger's hair and forced her to stand up. 

"Let's take it somewhere more convenient." Phillip said getting nodes from the unknown woman.

With Maya still impaled on his dick, with her feet locked behind his back, he followed the runner into the adjoining park. She didn't bother pulling her sports bra back on as they walked on the grass towards a picnic table. Maya was resting her head on his shoulder, contemplating the events of the last hour. She could not believe what she was doing; it was so not like her. But that's what she wanted to change, her life, her lifestyle. She felt Phillips dick move around in her with every step he took. It was so crazy, walking in the dark park with a man's cock deep inside her. With every step it hit a different spot. It was so erotic, exciting and naughty. She started to like being naughty, not the good girl she was her whole life.

They reached the table and Phillip gently laid Maya on it, and smiling at her started pumping again. Her eyes rolled back into her head and she closed them to enjoy the sex. Phillip motioned to the stranger to come closer. As she did, he whispered in her ear:

"Take them off," pointing to her shorts.

She did so without a word and stood there almost naked, only her sports bra pulled up over her small tits. He whispered again.

"Sit on her face." 

She looked at him with wide eyes and he nodded his head towards Maya. She climbed on the table, put one leg on each side of Maya's head facing Phillip, awaiting instructions.
