 Now that her children had left home, Elyse was free to go nude about the house just about any time she wanted, though she rarely did. It wasn't the same as being outdoors with Connor, in the free air, in a place where they theoretically could be seen but wouldn't be. Those places were becoming harder to find all the time.

The larger problem was what to do with each other now that they were "just" a couple again. It seemed strange to have their evenings and weekends unstructured after more than twenty years of a dependable routine, punctuated by moments of panic when one emergency or another threatened to engulf young Ben or Julia.

Their love was still thereâ€”the legacy of years spent building a home and a family together. They just needed to re-energize it now that the big shared effort was done.

"Maybe we should travel," Elyse said one night as they cleared their supper plates. "I've always wanted to see Europe or Asia, haven't you?"

"Sure, let's look into it," replied Connor.

They studied travel guides, gazing at color illustrations of different worlds, places that seemed much more alive than their dull little Midwestern city. Places that held exciting adventure for a middle-aged but still young-at-heart pair of lovers.

But they weren't quite that pair yet, and there was no guarantee that travel would convert them.

In the end, they decided that they should achieve their marriage renewal first; their adventures after that would be all the sweeter.
