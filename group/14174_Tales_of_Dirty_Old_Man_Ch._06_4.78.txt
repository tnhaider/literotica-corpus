 Tales of a dirty old man - Ch 6

I describe myself as a wannabe Dirty old man, not because I am one, but because as my best friend Karen keeps telling me, there is no higher accolade and so I should aim to be one.

This is the sixth chapter in this series - I recommend you to read the previous chapters in order before this one.

Once again this story would not have been possible without the feedback and encouragement I received from Romantic1.
