 This story is part of a continuation of my Road Trip series (see the end of 'Road Trip -- California' for a list of the chapters of that series, in order to be read). You need not read that series to enjoy this series. Although real places and celebrity names are used for realism, this story is fiction. Please 'read, enjoy, vote, and comment.'

Synopsis of This Story So Far: After a cross-country road trip laced with grief, love, incest, and sex, Jim moved in with country music star Crystal Lee and her sister in Nashville. Thanks to Crystal, Jim also became a top country music sensation. Crystal posed for Playboy in a sex-filled weekend photo shoot. Jim, his sister, sister-in-law, and friends later enjoyed a New Years holiday orgy on a Caribbean isle. After hiring a sexpot Russian housekeeper, Crystal and Jim head in different directions to make two movies. On the west coast for his movie, Jim (with Ellen) reconnects with Tina a love interest from his road trip, participates in an orgy with his leading lady, and finds a new love interest in Claire. The film crew moved to Nicaragua to film on location, and Jim's movie star Jill Danes was kidnapped. Jim did a bold and risky rescue, using his skills as a Green Beret from decades earlier. Soon after, shooting finished on Jim's movie, and Ellen, Claire, and he headed home to Nashville.
