 for A.G.

The principal protagonist in the tale I have to tell you is a woman by the name of Myrtle Mary Townsend. She prefers to be known as Myr, because the elegant, mysterious and slightly aromatic image that this single syllable conjures up is far more accurate than what you might imagine on hearing her given name.

Her own story is long, complicated and for the most part obscene. It is enough, for now, to say that she is twenty-nine, tall, beautiful, raven-haired and pale and, thanks to an ever-waging war for affection between her wealthy father and even wealthier step-father, has ready access to an amount of money which, if written down, might easily be mistaken for a phone number.

She has three degrees, speaks six languages, plays two musical instruments to a near-professional standard and a third merely excellently.

I know, sickening isn't it? She's really nice too, which somehow makes it worse.

Unless you get on her bad side, that is.

You don't want to do that.

She has been my closest friend for many years - though our backgrounds could hardly be more different - and when we first met... ah, but I digress. Let's get started, shall we?
