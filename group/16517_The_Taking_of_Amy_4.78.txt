 Author's Note: This is the tale of a married couple who are secure enough in their love for each other to welcome a young woman into the loving circle of their arms. If you find that theme troubling, this story is perhaps not the right one for you.

On the other hand, if you are the sort who would go "Oh, I wish I was in that little mix of limbs," then what are you waiting for? Read on and enjoy.
