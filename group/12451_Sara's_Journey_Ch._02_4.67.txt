 Author's note: I want to thank soulz4 for his skill and patience in editing my story. His generosity with his time and effort is much appreciated. Any deficiencies in this story are mine.

As a newbie author any constructive feedback, positive or negative is welcome. The characters will best be understood if the story is read from the beginning chapter. Of course you may just want to skip to the "good" parts and rub one out. That's okay too.
