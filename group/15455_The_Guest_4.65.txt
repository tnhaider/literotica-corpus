 It begins with a look I suppose, a nod of the head, a turn towards the stairs, towards an unseen room, and in a moment I know I'll be following them to bed, though I'll wait a few minutes while they gather their things, make arrangements, have the final powwow, but I'll follow soon enough, up those stairs and down the hall, I'll knock gently, politely, on the door, can I come in, 

and when I get there she'll already be in bed, under the covers, she'll be so shy at first, and he'll be getting out of his jeans, half-hard, there'll be no shyness from him, he'll stumble out of his pants, eager as a teenager, and I'll see her eyes bending towards the floor, her hands fisting themselves under the sheets, I'll see the tandem curve of their smiles, an agreement, their agreement, and I'll know what I'm getting into just then, I'll know the vow, the promise, the technicalities of their love, I'll see this definitive outline and I'll know where I stand, and I will feel the invitation, the privilege, the luck, the luck,

and I will sidle into bed just like that, lucky, I will slip myself in next to her as he's taking off his watch, I will slip into bed with her and she'll be naked, and her eyes will lift to mine and tell me to get naked, too, and when I do, when I squirrel out of my jeans and unbutton my shirt under the sheets, dishevel myself of my bra and underwear and push the bundle of clothes to the floor, when I am naked and lying parallel exactly, it will amaze me how decisively she'll reach for my mouth, run her tongue along my lips and then dig deep, it will amaze me how in the first kiss she will unlock herself, reveal her hunger, it will astonish me how easily she will open and close her thighs around me, unshy, unshy,

and he, of course, will watch the sidelines, amused, aroused, still in an undershirt, but it won't be long before he'll dip to the curves of this bed, won't be long before he'll kiss her from behind and dart himself about her flesh, pressing into her, kneading her, and at first it will be that simple, this pressing and kneading, it'll be just for her he'll do this, and I'll be watching in some oddly voyeuristic way, I'll be kissing her yet watching somehow from the curious promontory of the polite guest, I'll begin to see how it works with them, see how fluidly he'll gather momentum, see him lifting himself from behind, then straddling her body, I'll see him sinking into her, flattening her against the sheets, I'll see his cock flattening against her pelvis, and I'll see how the rubbing will begin this way, cock against pelvis, the frenetic rubbing beginning from him, from him,

and her eyes will be closed and her mouth will be on mine, and she'll be feeling it, feeling cock against pelvis, feeling tongue against tongue, she will just want to feel it now, unseeing, and my hands will rise from the trench between her thighs and his thighs and my thighs, my hands will rise and find her breasts, I will circle her nipples with my palms, and there'll be a clenching from within her, a tightening in her torso, her mouth will harden on mine, glue itself to me, and we will be gripping each other like that, mouth, breast, palm, not even a sheet's width of space between us, not even a sheet's width of space, 

and our three long bodies will hold their posture until the balance inevitably tips, until we won't fit like that anymore, I'll begin to slip off, slip away, a corner of the bedside table digging into my back, the sheets bunching, and it will feel unsexy, unsexy, and I'll decide to take action, irreverent now, I will pull myself over him, around her, I will move to the other side of the bed, and she'll follow me, her mouth like suction on mine, and he will follow me, too, still flat against her, his hand will follow me, curve around my ass, his thumb will crawl inside my cunt, insinuating, insinuating, 

and this will be the first of our linkings, his cock against her, her mouth locked to my mouth, his thumb in my cunt, my palms on her nipples, we will be a tumble of flesh and bone, a tumble of flesh and bone,

and now he will definitely want to fuck her, and she will definitely want him to fuck her, and I will remember myself, despite my irreverence I will remember to be a polite guest, and I will wait for instructions, and they will be there, she'll give them to me, she'll bring my hands down to her stomach, to her hips, she'll pull at me a little, come closer, and I will unlink myself from his thumb and come closer, obedient, obedient, 

and he'll make way, he'll see me start to climb up and he'll make way, a space will be made for me, and I will take it, I'll climb on top of her, flatten myself against her, he'll retreat a little, raise himself from the shins so he's barely hovering, and she'll let out a small cry as I bend to take her breast in my mouth, she'll let out this small cry of pleasure, and it will not be a cry I will recognize, it will be a cry that he recognizes, and that will be his instruction, she will raise her thighs a little and he will lift his hands to her knees and push them out, he'll lean in, thighs drawing forward, and he will start to fuck her, he'll be on his knees, cock out, and I'll be flat against her, he will start to fuck her, he will start to fuck her,

and she will let out more small cries and that's when he'll unleash his cock inside, drive it up and in for real now, real fucking now, and I'll feel the movement, too, I will in fact almost fall off because he's fucking her like that, with raw, gravelly speed, and I'll have to right myself, drive my knees into the mattress, put the backs of my feet on the top of his thighs as he's fucking, I'll have to right myself, to right myself,

and I will feel like a mast on a ship, finding the equilibrium of us, I will feel like the pivot point of us even though she is the real pivot point, she is the hinge on which we're resting, with his cock barreling into her, with my mouth moist on her breasts, we'll be orbiting around her, orbiting, 

and even though he could come at any minute he will stop fucking her now, he won't want to come yet, won't want this to be it, and that will be alright with us, we're all a little bit drunk and restless, and so when he stops fucking her, we'll each reevaluate, consider the options, shift slightly, she'll swipe at the hair in her eyes, I'll unstick myself from her skin, he'll take his cock out of her, give a "holy fuck" for emphasis, for humor, for encouragement, there will sighing, a giggle, adjustments, adjustments, 

and she'll open her eyes and squirm out from under us, her hands against the mattress, she'll give a tiny, almost imperceptible grunt and we will move aside, he to her right and I to her left, she will put a palm against his chest, stay, stay, and she'll overtake me then, there'll be the surprise of her body turning over and looming, gargantuan, above mine, and I will surrender to the shadow of her torso, surrender to her long hair when it falls on my face and bathes me with curls, I will close my eyes for real this time, close them to the bedside light, I will close my eyes to this and enter, quietly, into the small center of myself, I will enter into the small center of myself,

and she will begin to kiss my neck, and he will begin to kiss my mouth, they will both be kissing me, and I will not be able to be quiet much longer, my back will arch involuntarily, meaningfully, and he will stop and edge down to where my thighs intersect, and he will divide the intersection with his tongue, and she'll be kissing me, splaying my mouth with her tongue, and he will splaying my cunt with his tongue, and I will lie back unquietly and let them do this, let them open me like this,

and I will not protest when his elbow digs into my hip, I will not protest when a curl of her goes into my mouth, I will not protest the weight, the heat of them, on me, I will not protest because my eyes will be closed to these small inconveniences, I will give myself to them, invited, lucky guest, I will open into this opening, though I'll forget the precise rules of guestly etiquette, in my unquietness I will forget, and rise towards the vortex of their bodies, and this is when he will remember the rules, this is when he'll remember the vow, the promise, the technicalities, this is when he'll remember her, and he won't be the one to fuck me, he will know this, they will know this, she will know this, she'll be the one, she'll be the one, 

and she'll snake down my torso with her tongue, and kiss at my stomach, my navel, my hip, and I will be unquiet again, and then she'll disappear somewhere I can't imagine her to be, and he'll move aside, he will move aside to watch this, he will move aside, unclasp from me though he will leave fingers there, he will leave fingers in me and then make way, and then I will feel her there, I will feel her there,

I will feel her mouth crawl to me, I will feel her tongue tipping into my cunt, and I will, for a split second, leap at the touch, the strange touch of her tongue on my cunt, and I will, for a split second, leap at the memory, the touch, of his fingers, his tongue, in my cunt, and I will worry that she and I and he will not mean this, worry that we'll be awkward in the morning, awkward awkward, every morning awkward after this, but I'll let it go, have to, I'll let it go, I'll let this ambiguous, hinging moment go because we will not be ambiguous at all, we will not be ambiguous at all, 

and he will watch with beautiful restraint as she fucks me with her mouth, he will gaze into the telescopic horizon of her as she launches into me with her unambiguous touch, and I'll reach for her hair, unambiguous, I will reach for her shoulders, for something of her, and for something of him, I will want to reach for something of him, too, my thighs will close around his fingers, unambiguous, my hands will clutch a swath of her curls, I will want to somehow say thank you, a polite guest I will want to express this gratitude, I'll want to make any humble gesture, small gift, towards such voluminous hospitality, and instead I'll cry out, I will cry this gratitude out loud, I will cry out to both of them, and the world under my eyelids will explode into tiny splashes of color, galaxies being born, a blackness re-invented, and from this new, pixelated dark I will hear the alto chorus of our breathing, a song of brief and feverish harmony.
