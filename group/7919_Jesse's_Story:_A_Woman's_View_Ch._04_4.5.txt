Her Story

It was about a year after I had my first threesome, that I would experience a 'two-for', two new experiences in the same evening. It would be a result of attending a social with Harry and Vicki at their 'club'. These things were a 'meet and greet' affair, no couplings allowed on premise, just a chance to socialize and meet others in the lifestyle. 

There were never any sexual encounters between the four of us at all, and except for my first time, Harry wasn't a part of my 'rotation' as Ray called it. Once a month or so, I would get 'the urge' and we'd have a romp with either Greg or Geoff, both always satisfying, on many different levels. I was happy with that, I was very content but at times, I did wonder about other possibilities; with a couple perhaps, or with another woman, but I would wonder, that's all. 

We saw Harry and Vicki socially; movies, bar-b-ques, etc. but nothing sexual. As I've mentioned before, I truly believe that, down deep, Vick resented me in Ray's life. Oh well, you can't please 'em all, can you?

They asked us to this because this particular social was a 'bring a friend theme', to introduce new faces to the mix. We went with them as their guests as a favor to them. Later, I told Ray that I was also a bit interested in how those things worked; the socials that is, and I was looking forward to watching the dynamics of such an event among the attendees. So it was in this frame of mind that I attended my first-ever, swingers' social, ta-da!
