 Author's note: This is the continuation of Kit and Brogan's story. If you have read the first chapter you are aware that they are a gay couple. 

Hunger and long suppressed passion left no room for romance. Buttons flew across the foyer in Brogan's haste to unclothe Kit and remove his own clothing. Naked, Kit looped his arms around Brogan's neck, pressing his hard cock into Brogan's thigh. Brogan lifted Kit into his arms, and Kit wrapped his legs around Brogan's waist. Brogan made his way upstairs to their bedroom, raining kisses on Kit's face with each step. 

Reaching the bedroom, Brogan smiled as he noticed the rose petals strewn across the bed. As usual, Kit was prepared.

"What would you have done if I hadn't arrived today?" He asked in a whisper. 

Kit kissed Brogan's nose and replied, "The same thing I did yesterday and the day before." 

Brogan laughed. "And what, pray tell, is that?"

"Start over with fresh roses." Kit grinned. 

"My glorious wife. I don't deserve you." Brogan kissed Kit and laid him on the bed.

"Of course you do. You're a wonderful human being. Anyone would be lucky to have you, but I'm thankful you chose me."

"Baby, I don't think I had a choice. You stole my heart the first time we met."

"Are you complaining?"

"Oh, Hell no! I thank my lucky stars each day that God saw fit for us to meet. You complete me."

"And you me. Now hush and love me. I've missed you so very much." Kit grasped Brogan's cock and, with a gentle tug, pulled him forward.
