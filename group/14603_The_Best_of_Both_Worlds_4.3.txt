 Celia looked at Sam across the kitchen table. Her mind was reeling. She ran her fingers through her short blond hair. "How long have you known?"

Sam shrugged, his eyes firmly planted on the saltshaker. He couldn't stand to see the pain he was inflicting reflected in her bright blue eyes. "I suppose I've known for a long time but wouldn't admit it, even to myself."

"But how?" She covered her mouth.  "How could you make love to me all those times... when...how could you?"

Sam finally looked up. "Because I knew it made you happy."

Celia's eyes welled up. "Do you... do you want a divorce?"

Sam shook his head. He loved her and their life together; the house they shared, the dogs, making breakfast together in the morning, watching television together at night. He couldn't imagine going through a day without her.

"But how?" How could they possibly go on? Obviously, something would have to change.

"I don't know, but you're my best friend. I don't want to lose you. I guess... it's up to you." Sam prayed that she wouldn't simply tell him to get out. 

Celia's gripped Sam's hand as she stared into his eyes. Her husband was gay. She still loved him. "No, I don't want a divorce either. We'll figure something out."
