 Preface:

To bring my readers up to date, let me summarize the recent facts of my life:

At the time of this story, I had been living for over three years in a committed relationship with my partner Sylvie, whom you may have met in my previous stories.  I was 4 months pregnant by Sylvie's brother Phillipe.  Phillipe and his daughter had spent the week prior to our trip vacationing with us in St. Martin.  Then all four of us flew to Lyon, France where the beginning of our trip included the wedding of  Sylvie's cousin.  Following a week in Lyon, Phillipe flew back to Atlanta leaving his daughter to spend three weeks with her French cousins while Sylvie and I had a vacation.
