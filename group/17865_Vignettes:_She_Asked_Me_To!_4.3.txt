 In retrospect, I still think it was a good idea, at the time, and Eli agrees with me. Eli is my wife, my friend, my lover of over 25 years. But, I digress.

In the early years of our marriage, when we were in our thirties, we became involved in the swinging lifestyle. Both of us had exes, and by the time we met, we had both been around the block a few times. My ex and I were in the lifestyle and upon hearing of some my stories from those days, Eli became curious and we explored for several years. All of that is told in order that you might get 'into the moment', so to speak.
