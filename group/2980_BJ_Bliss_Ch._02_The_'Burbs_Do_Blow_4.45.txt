 Katrin went up to the counter and ordered a third cappuccino from the surly mustachioed barista, despite the fact that she was already shaking from a caffeine buzz. It was nearly lunch time, but she was not hungry. After stewing for a couple of hours about her business partner Malena's tactless job postings she decided to do some posting of her own. If BJ Bliss was going to venture out into the suburbs for some blowjob workshops then she would have to start getting the word out about their services and line up some clients.

Katrin looked on in annoyance at the barista as he slowly prepared her drink, pausing frequently to regale an attractive tattooed female co-worker with his knowledge of the local music scene. Katrin rolled her eyes and decided to wait for the drink at her table, when her phone vibrated with a text from Peter: I'm free Friday morning for a follow-up meeting if you're interested?

After pausing for what she felt was the appropriate amount of seconds, she replied to confirm the time and place. A rush of relief washed over her. She had been stressed from the moment Peter left their office the previous morning as she wondered if he would want to see her again.

Katrin felt terrible about her fight with Malena and realized that she might have overreacted. She decided to head back to the office and make amends.

"Miss! Your cappuccino is ready," the barista called out to her as she headed for the door.

"You can have it," she said as she threw some bills on the counter on her way out.
