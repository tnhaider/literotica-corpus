 My husband and I have done the swinging scene over the years and I've enjoyed it, although he is really the instigator most of the time. He's always finding men for me in one of those throw away papers. You know the sort of thing, they're usually full of radical articles, columns, and letters and ads, and in the back are sex ads: "Couple would like to meet hot, hung male for......" and "Bi-girl wants to meet pretty woman, any age, for mutually satisfying sex." And so on. In our local paper there are several pages.

Gar presents an interesting ad to me from time to time. Most of them I reject, but once in a while there's something interesting and from time to time I have a new lover or we have a new playmate.

Recently he looked up from reading the ads and said:

"Here's an interesting one Charlie." And held out the paper for me to read.
