 This story could be submitted under a number of genres; however, the dominant theme is Group. It follows an increasing number of characters; thus, to reduce confusion the reader will find a 'list of the characters' at the end of each chapter with approximate ages and how they 'fit' into the plot. Someone told me good fiction is based on reality and truth; this story is no exception. Lastly, while there are what I hope are exciting doses of sex, the story also has a few doses of philosophy about relationships and sexuality that I hope the reader will indulge â€“ and perhaps even comment upon. Enjoy. The chapters will be posted on consecutive days.
