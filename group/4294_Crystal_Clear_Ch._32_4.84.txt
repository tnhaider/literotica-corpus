 This chapter will not make sense without having read the prior two or three chapters.  This chapter also ends the Crystal Clear series.

Crystal Clear is a continuation of my Road Trip series (see the end of 'Road Trip â€“ California' for a list of the chapters of that series, in order to be read).  You need not read that series to enjoy this one.  Earlier chapters contain a synopsis of the story to that point.  

Although real places and celebrity names are occasionally used for realism, this story is fiction.  Please 'read, enjoy, vote, and comment.'
