 Author's Note: Hey there guys and gals it's me again. I hope you weren't too excited for this chapter since it took me so long to get it done. Honestly I didn't do much work these last months. Mainly I enjoyed my freetime since I finally graduated from highschool. But I do hope you enjoy this chapter as much as the previous one, but before it starts I have something else I want to say. Many of you recommended I should get a second editor whose native language is English and I really want to do that. So before I go to the Literotica editor programm I wanted to ask you, my readers, if any of you would like to be my editor(s). If any of you are interested in working with me I would like you to send me an Email at the adress I left on my profile here at Literotica. Also I would like you to give me some kind of information what qualifies you and why you'd like to be my editor. If no one sends me an Email I of course will also look for an editor on the editor programm since I really want to refine my stories. That being said I hope you enjoy this installment of the Shaman Chronicles and as always I thank A.L. for her editing work and her encouragement. This story wouldn't be what it is without her.
