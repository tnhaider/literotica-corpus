 This story was intended to be a romance-adventure...of sorts. But, its futuristic setting also makes it a Sci/fi-adventure as well. When I started this, I had no idea which category I should put it in...and at the time of submission still may not be sure. 



Pronunciation on some of the characters is as follows....

Keeqoht: key – COAT

Hok'ee: HOKE – ee As in Hokey-Pokey



The main reason for these author's notes is to clarify a few things in this story to avoid any confusion. To help the reader out, names of places will be followed sometimes, by their original name in brackets. Here also is an explanation for units of measure used in this story. Some are obsolete; some will be made up for this story. Examples are....

A league (obsolete) is approximately three miles. [4.8km] 

A pace (obsolete) is approximately three feet (one yard) [0.91m]



Others will be explained as the story progresses...that is, if I go on with multiple chapters for this story. That will depend on how well this is received among you readers. That being said...in the words of the late great Jackie Gleason. "And away we go...."
