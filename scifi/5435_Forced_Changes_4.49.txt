 I awoke in the darkness, my blankets curled half around my half my body, hugging me like a giant anaconda. An uncomfortable dampness soaked my ass mixing with the shot dark mess of hair creating a sticky mass. I've gotta start turning down the thermostat, I thought drowsily as I rolled over covering my nude form fully in the blanket. I drifted off to a sleep that was once more plagued with nightmares of an unnatural woman sticking things in my ass. 

In a dark corner of the room two unnatural points of blue lights stared unblinking at the male form breathing steadily in the darkness. 

I awoke groggily in the morning, peeling myself out of bed, my back and ass sticky from the sweaty residue of the haunting nightmares of the previous day. I scratched at my junk, yawning as I stumbled into the shower. Note to self, stop reading urban fantasy before bedtime, it causes some seriously uncomfortable dreams. I turned the shower to lukewarm and started lathering myself, once more grateful to live alone in my apartment, I felt dirty from last night's heat. Having to wait for the bathroom would suck. My living alone also meant that all the utilities were mine to pay. This led to nights like last night, the sweaty nights sleep caused by frugality necessitated by my entry level job while I went to school. I vigorously scraped around my body trying to scrub away the lingering memories. I was drying off as I heard phone ringing on my bed. I scrambled to pick it up but the call stopped just I made it to my dresser. I listened to the message mom had left. 

"Sydney, this is your mother calling on Saturday morning to remind you about your grandfather's birthday tomorrow. We are meeting him at Perkins at 9:00. You know the one by the airport. Hope you didn't drink too much last night. Love you honey." I laughed at the last bit. My mom knew I hated the taste of alcohol and preferred a Friday night of video games and books over socializing. Speaking of which, I flipped open my kindle to finish my book about werewolves and vampires that had fueled my latest nightmares. My stomach started grumbling as I was reaching the climax of the book. I pried myself away to get a bowl of Lucky Charms, splashing milk some milk into it as I sat at my kitchen table. I went back to the book as I absentmindedly shoveled the soggy sugary cardboard mass into my mouth. I continued to eat as a generic half vampire finally got around to accepting her heritage thus gaining the power necessary to defeat the megalomaniac werewolf. 

It was a cliche and generic book but I still felt the rush of imagining the glorious triumph of good over evil. I noticed I finished the cereal but hunger still gnawed at my belly. I spotted an old apple resting on my counter, its dusky red skin highlighted in the morning sun. I had dropped it on the floor earlier in the week when I grabbed it's brother to slake a previous hunger. I looked at it carefully before shrugging and munching around the soft spot. Join your brothers in the rest of the glorious dead. The hunger diminished but did not go away. I was officially out of food in my apartment. I ordered a couple of Jimmy John's sandwiches and turned on the tv to watch some Sports Center as I waited for the food to arrive. 

A little bit later, Jimmy John's texted me and I met him outside the building ravenous hunger causing my limbs to feel weak. I shoved money into the delivery guys hand as I hurried back to my room. I shredded the sandwich bag and inhaled the sandwiches the hunger having grown uncontrollable in the intervening time. The sandwiches did nothing for the hunger. In fact my entire body started to grow hot as my stomach clenched in a painful cramp. The heat concentrated on my nipples and pelvis as I curled up into a ball on the floor. The pain washing over my body in waves of blinding heat. My fingers curled into claws that scratched ineffectively at the generic off white carpet of my room. I rocked myself on the floor, unable to concentrate from the pain, as tears leaked out of my eyes to stain the carpet. 

I'm dying. This is how I die curled up, alone, on the floor. I could read it now, lonely man dies of strange gastrointestinal distress. Doctors stumped. He is survived by his mother and father and accomplished nothing during his life. Something shifted inside me and I felt the heat pool sharply in little orbs of fire in my chest before they exploded, causing brief cessations of pain. The relief felt orgasmic, in stark contrast to the burning heat of the previous moment and I failed to notice the miniscule expansion that accompanied the bubbles bursting. The wires in my brain shorted again, the overwhelming heat concentrated on my pelvis flipped. the raging inferno transforming from pain to incredible pleasure. My overstimulate penis throbbed painfully, half erect, constrained by shorts. My prostate ached in need and I tried to release my package from its confines but my trembling muscles refused to obey my commands. 

The pressure built and built until a damn burst inside me as cum erupted from my balls soaking my underwear and shorts. The release was enormous, causing my whole body to clench and release in a mighty orgasm . The relief was short lived as the pressure quickly built again causing my pants to tighten as they labored to control my raging erection. The pain of my cock straining against my pants wasn't quite as noticeable this time as I quickly built to a second orgasm. I was held captive by the alternating pleasure and pain in both my cock and breasts. The sensations built and released in an unending cycle with less recovery time between each release. The pain a little less each time until I was drowning in a sea of overwhelming pleasure. I was almost continuously orgasming as rivulets of liquids ran down my legs and shorts. Finally I was able to release my hold on consciousness and drifted gratefully into the unfeeling darkness. 

"Sweet Sydney. It's time to wake up, you have duties to attend to." The sultry tones of a woman tickled my consciousness rousing me from my therapeutic sleep. For the second time in as many days I awoke with a sticky feeling on my body this time it was over my legs. I groaned as I disorientingly lifted myself off the floor. I quickly remembered what had happened and I braced myself for any strange burning feelings. Nothing.I noticed was the odd weights I felt on my upper chest and a drafty feeling I felt on my legs but nothing painful caught my attention. It was at this point that I realized I was not alone in my room. I opened my eyes and gazed upon the most beautiful naked woman I had ever seen. She was gorgeous and voluptuous with perky tits that begged to be stroked. Her skin had a soft golden tone and her brilliant blue eyes pierced the intervening distance. Her right eye was slightly obscured by the straight brown locks that ran down to her shoulder blades but the glowing blue orb seemed to shine through her hair anyway, grabbing my gaze in its intensity. My eyes lowered to the rest of her anatomy and I saw that she had two very unusual things about her. One, she had a throbbing eight inch cock jutting out right above an inflamed pussy. Two, she had a whip thin tail with a spade shaped head the size of a deck of cards that was wrapping around said cock stroking it slowly. I backed away in fear quickly hitting the opposite wall in my haste to get away. She had a disappointed look on her face as she slowly stalked toward me her padded hips swaying provocatively. "Really. Is that any way to greet your new mistress." 

Hallucinating. Was my immediate thought. Man I should not have ate that apple. I stopped panicking at that thought. I stood up straight and walked over to her because, excluding the appendages, she was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen. Man, my subconscious needs a serious talking to. This seems so real. 

"Much better," she purred as she reached out to touch me chest. The panic quickly returned as her touch brought my attention to some changes in my own anatomy. I had tits. Her hands contacted my naked flesh, my flesh gave way, softly conforming to the shape of her hand. Her touch dispelled the notion that this was a hallucination as pleasure shot through my chest, pooling in my pelvis in a ball of electricity. She lightly caressed my breasts through my shirt teasing the nipple slightly causing little bursts of sensation. I felt a dampness in my pelvic region and refused to consider any additional change. My eyes darted about as I frantically searched for an avenue of escape. I turned to run, to escape from the magical touch that was turning my flesh into a quivering pool of jelly. I made it one whole step before a powerful arm reached across my chest and pinned me to her chest in a vice like embrace. Her penis slid between my legs still being stroked by her tail. They pushed against the wet spot on my jeans and I moaned aloud at the bolt of lightning that diffused through my flesh at the pressure. This can't be happening. I need to wake up now. My breath rushed in and out of me in harsh panicked breaths, I struggling vainly to free myself from her silky embrace. 

"Shhhhh. Honey. It'll all be over soon." She whispered into my ear as her free hand reached down to her throbbing member and scooping off a bead of liquid that had formed at its tip. Her smell wafted over me and I relaxed into her grasp letting her firm mounds press into my back. She smelled of musky spices and desire. The damp spot on my pants turned into a trickle of fluids as I became hornier than I had ever felt before. She brought the liquid to my mouth before gently pressing her finger to my lips slipping effortlessly inside my mouth. The flavor burst on my tongue with the delicious sweetness of a dozen fruits. I shuddered in ecstasy as I swirled the flavor throughout my mouth. I suckled lightly on her finger trying to scrape every last particle off her finger with my tongue. The part of my brain that was scared of the situation was no longer in control. I now only had one objective, obtain more of that delectable substance. 

The woman turned me around and looked me in the eye gauging my reaction. I was now a slave to my lust as she slowly pushed me to the floor unwinding her tail from her cock as she did. The tumescent member stood proudly in front of me as I greedily pulled its length into my mouth. I slathered her member with my spit and quickly got to bobbing my head back and forth. I had seen this done a couple of times in pornos but had no reliable experience. I moved enthusiastically as I tried to coax the delicious liquid from it. Spit dripped down my face and chin as her member surged in and out of my mouth. I felt its length expand slightly as she grasped my head and pulled it tight to her stomach, sheathing herself fully. I choked on her girth as thick spurts of her sweet cum poured directly into my stomach. I orgasmed at the taste and consciousness left me once more as the rational part of my mind railed helplessly against the bars of lust. 

I was awakened at the wet sound of flesh slapping flesh in a loud clap. I wasn't sticky, which, compared to the last couple of times I had awoken, was an outlier. A burning sting on my inner thigh informed me where the sound came from. I could feel locks of wet hair tickling my shoulders as the scent of musky spice roused me entirely from my sleep. 

"Can't have you sleeping on the job can we. Besides, you'll want to be awake for this." 

I looked up off my bed to see the woman from last night towering over me, penis in hand. 

Awake for what? 

The thought barely had time to form before the woman thrust her hips forward sharply, impaling me on her entire length in one smooth stroke. There was a burst of pain as something inside me tore free, giving way to the invader within my body. The woman paused for a moment allowing my clenched muscles to relax slightly before she started rocking her hips causing delicious friction to rise from my pussy. No avoiding its presence this time. My cock had been replaced with a womanly slit. Our positions gave me full view of her invasion as my gaze passed through my own bouncing tits. A newly familiar pool gathered quickly in my gut as she continued her even pace. The sweet friction of her member inside of me caused my eyes to close, basking in the swirling sensations rising from my pussy. I knew I should be rejecting this but lust was still in control and I was reveling in the wanton hedonism of the act. The electricity grew in intensity sending out little shocks throughout my body that caused muscles to clench and release in an effort to discharge it. The woman smiled at my reactions as she leaned forward and gently teased the nipples of my bare breasts. The two points of additional stimulation caused the pleasure to peak sharply and then rush in a wave throughout my body as I flooded her member with my juices. 

"That's it baby. Cum for me." Her grin was more predatory now as she continued her metronome like thrusting into my body. I expected the boneless relaxation of post orgasm I was used to. My body had other ideas. As my muscles finally finished tensing I realized that the pool of electricity had never gone away, it was waiting and it now continued its growth at the woman's tender ministrations. I was past the point of orgasm yet the pleasure continued to grow. I felt myself clenching instinctively on her shaft my pussy attempting to coax the fluid from it. Each tense of my pussy caused a delicious feeling of fullness in me and I realized I was quickly approaching another peak. I grabbed my own nipples this time and pulled sharply attempting to recreate the sensation of before and drive myself through sweet swell of release. I moaned wantonly before I finally passed through my second orgasm as the woman continued to pound away at me. 

The smile on the woman's face was gone and replaced with a look of intense concentration. Her movements were no longer smooth and even and were instead jerky and fierce. She slammed into me as I felt her swell inside me filling my every crevice with her member. I had moment of feeling the wet heat of her fluid discharge inside me before my mind exploded in a coruscation of heat flowed through my body instantly sending me to a third orgasm. The compounded reactions of the second and third orgasm had me lying bonelessly on the bed panting from the effort. She pulled out with a wet plop as her cum clung desperately to my vagina in a gooey wad. The rational part of my mind was able to break through the post coital haze for a moment to whisper breathlessly, heartbrokenly. 

"Why?" 

The satisfied smirk left her face. There was a flash of sorrow, that was quickly replaced with a merciless grin. 

"Didn't you enjoy being my cum bucket? I'll show you pleasures you've never known. Sleep now sweety, mistress will be here when you wake up." 

Tears dripped from my eyes as consciousness faded once more. I weeped as I felt a piece of me die, the majority of my mind reveling in the warmth flowing through my body and the security I felt at her dominance. 

I sharply jerked awake in my room, heart hammering wildly in my chest. I kept my eyes peeled shut and tried not to move, afraid of what I would feel if I did. A hand slipping from behind me drawing smoothly across my chest quickly confirmed my fears. I shuddered at the smooth caress, the fingertips leaving little trails of heat in their wake. I opened my eyes and turned to look into the glorious visage of my tormentor. A stab of desire tore through me body as my gaze locked onto her shining blue orbs. 

"How bout you make us some breakfast honey. And don't even think about covering that beautiful form with clothing." 

I wanted to deny her. To scream. To escape... 

I failed to do any of these things, instead I simply nodded. Luxuriating in the heat pouring off her bare skin for a moment before shrugging off the blankets. I tried to go over to my abandoned clothes piled in the corner of the room but my body paid my mind no attention. I sauntered into the kitchen and realized that I was still out of food. I panicked for a moment, realizing I couldn't fulfill mistresses request. Would she be mad at me. Wait. Why should I care if I failed to obey her? I hated her... right? The conflict tore at my insides as my mind warred with itself. The dilemma was resolved as I realized I could order some crepes from a local bakery that delivered. I called the number and ordered a variety of fruit crepes. Unsure what to do while I waited for the food to arrive I stood motionless in the kitchen. I should run. I thought. Why would we leave mistress? We should wait for her. The subservient part of my mind won the battle and I gently went and lowered myself to the floor outside my bathroom. I listened to the sound of mistress showering as the pieces of my mind continued to war inside me. The sound of water turned off and my mistress opened the door to see my kneeling form. I couldn't be sure but once more a flicker of sadness seemed to shoot across her features as she gazed down at my prostrated form. 

"Food?" 

"On its way mistress. I apologize for failing to do your bidding instantly. I accept any punishment you deem necessary." What the fuck was I saying. This isn't me, I tried to wail. I don't act like this. 

"That's okay. I'm sure we'll be able to think of something to pass the time." She paused for a moment and I watched as her cock retreated into her body with a wet schlurping sound. She crooked a finger towards me as she went over to the bed her moist lips glistening in a wetness that had nothing to do with water. She guided my unresisting head to her moist pussy as she leaned back on my bad. I flickered my lips tentatively against her puffy outer labia getting a small taste of her juices in the process. Oh my god. This was even better than her cum. I licked a small ring around her outer labia as her heady taste removed all thoughts of resistance from my head. Her juices tasted like a creamy semi sweet chocolate, a delicate bitterness lending depth to the flavor. 

I abandoned my exploratory licks as I ruthlessly plunged my tongue into her creamy depths. She let out an appreciative moan at my ministrations. I instinctively reached down and slipped a finger into my own depths. My tongue seemed longer than I remembered as I alternating a thrusting and twisting motion that was effortless. Her moans grew louder at the attention. A pressure grew at my lower spin that tingled as I relentlessly stroked my inner walls. My finger glanced a nub at the top of my folds and I gasped, momentarily stunned by the shock of pleasure. I returned to my ministrations as I contemplated this discovery. I brought my free hand up from its grasp on her thigh as I used my thumb to peel back the upper folds of her pussy. I could see a similar nub on her body and I decided to use my newly acquired knowledge of female anatomy. I viciously attacked her depths with my tongue and I pressed sharply against the nub rubbing it back and forth furiously. 

She let out a wordless shriek of noise and I found myself choking as a deluge of her creamy nectar flooded my mouth releasing the pressure I had building to crash through my limbs. She laid her head back breathing heavily as I rested my own gasping head against her stomach. My face and upper chest were sticky from the thick cream that had escaped my mouth. I drew my finger across my upper chest gathering the thick liquid onto my finger. I brought the finger into my mouth and let out a final shudder as an aftershock raged through my body at the taste. I jerked up in surprise as I heard a knock a my door.
