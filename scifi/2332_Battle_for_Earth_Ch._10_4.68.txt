Day 13

**Mexico City, Mexico**

Mexico, Region 2

Oscar stared at his hands and arms while his tiny wife carried him by his arms while she flew through the cloudy skies. His scars where Menja had crudely stitched him back together, were lighter than before now. With her power, she healed him as much as she could back at the national palace. She was unable to make his scars go entirely away. As a demoness and a resident of the infernal plane, her powers and abilities were not for healing but for degeneration, corruption and evil. Healing was not a demon's, regardless of rank, forte. 

She stopped above an area several miles outside of the capital city which she would use as a testing ground. First she needed to clear the area up. Menja carried her husband under one arm and with her other free hand, she pointed it in front of her and using telekinesis, cleared up a one mile diameter of homes, buildings, businesses including streets and trees. 

"My goodness, Menja. You have so much power..." Oscar said softly, unable to believe what he had just witnessed.

"And I am only going to get stronger the moment you begin worshiping me and offering me offerings and sacrifices, nyahahaha! But enough chit chat, we will use this cleared area to test out your invulnerability. We will start by throwing you like baseball!" 

"Menja wait as second, hold on!" Oscar yelled.

The tiny demon threw him like a baseball, creating a sonic boom from the force. Oscar curled up into a ball and yelled his lungs out as his life flashed before his eyes. One moment he staring back at a pile of destroyed buildings, and the next he was staring into darkness. He knew he had crashed into a large pile of debris and rubble, but didn't feel anything. He wondered if his body was too mangled for him to feel anything. But when he opened his eyes, he moved his arms and legs and neck to see if he was still fine. They were fine. They looked fine too. 

He stood up and dusted himself off. Menja came levitating downward, stopping just fifteen feet above him and floated in place. 

"That's exactly what I wanted to see. Not a scratch on you. I hope your ready for the next few assaults, big dick!" 

"Menja, darling hold up, aren't we doing too much too quickly? You threw me into the ground like I was a baseball and I'm not hurt. That's proof that what you did for me, worked!"

"Don't show your infernal wife cowardice, if you can't handle this, how do you expect to handle 10 or 12 cambion children? Speaking of children, these little bastards like to claw and bite from the inside. STOP SCRATCHING AND BITING YOUR MOTHER FROM THE INSIDE DAMNIT!! Are you ready Oscar?!"

"I don't kno-"

Menja raised both her hands up beside her head and created a multitude of weapons and powers, all ready to be used against him. She created firearms of all types and models. Missiles, rockets, bombs, grenade launchers. Balls of lighting, spears of fire, tridents made of ice, swords made of earth, daggers made of water and lances made of air. She pointed her tiny claw at him and in a split seconds, the firearms fired together and the elemental powers fired towards him. Oscar raised his arms and crossed them in front of him hoping to block some of the attacks. 

Explosions erupted in front of him one after another and all around him. Bullets that struck him fragmented on impact with his body. The elemental attacks were ineffective against him also. This barrage of fragmenting bullets, exploding bombs and missiles and elemental assaults lasted for approximately a minute before everything went silent. Oscar checked himself and saw that his clothes were shredded but his body was unharmed, except for a few soot and dirt marks. 

"Excellent, you are now damage proof. You're probably wondering why I did this to you, husband. Let your wife explain it to you. When that monster first appeared, I knew there would be many more that would come with each conception. That monster did not appear from nowhere, it was sent to us from God himself, except it isn't God, but his shadow."

"What? Are you serious?"

"Very serious. This side of your once benevolent and all loving master, is treating this planetary event like a game. And it is a game. He wants to see which breeding pair will have dominion over this new world. So I dipped your flesh into one of the rivers of hell and made you invulnerable to protect you from dangers like that divine monster and these little monsters that are going to be born soon. You see husband, a cambion's nature can be hard to predict and some may be extremely violent and will not think twice before hurting their human parent. Which Is why If our union in unholy matrimony was not enough to keep you safe, then this new body of yours would. I don't want to lose you for two reasons. I...I Lo-Love you..."

Oscar blushed and smiled at her. 

"...And second reason. You are not leaving me alone to raise and watch over these little devils all by myself. If you weren't around, I would just kill them, dark as night."

Oscar walked over to her and grabbed her by her ankles, pulled her down and held her close to him. Menja blushed and wrapped her legs behind his back and her arm behind his neck. She rested the side of her face on the crook of his neck. She smiled and closed her eyes. 

"Menja...look..." Oscar said softly.

The tiny demon opened her eyes and saw words appearing on billboards and newspapers littered around them. They all bore more or less the same message. Some of the messages read like so,

"You've done well to fend off my attack dog, Menja and Oscar. With each successful conception, expect more hunters like the one before."

"This world was awash with sin and evil. Humans had to go, and so I made them go, with the exception of twenty six humans that I chose to spare and twenty six non-human creatures that I specifically chose to pair up with the last humans. If the world will always goes to sin, let the last pairs and their hybrid spawns fill this world." 

**Yaounde, Cameroon**

Central Africa, Region 18 

Methild was met up by Eposi who journeyed over to stand next to him. She carried her AK47 with her. After everything that happened, fear had kept her grip frozen shut around the handle of the firearm. She was too afraid to drop it even after the monster was obviously dead. Taking a long look at her lover, she wondered if he was okay.

"Are you alright, Methild? That monster hit you pretty hard a few times."

"He broke both of my arms, but my elven physiology allows me to heal rapidly. I'll be able to use my arms, but I wont be able to use them to fight for some time after the first healing phase passes. But looking at the body of this monster, I wonder where it could have come from. Did it come here on its own?" 

Eposi wondered also. "Maybe it was sent here by someone. Sent for us." 

A gust of wind whipped up around them. In the air they heard something akin to whispering. Then there was vibrating going on in the side of Eposi's pants pocket. She realized it was her phone vibrating and pulled it out. To her shock and surprise, she saw that she had received a text message from an unknown sender. Methild leaned in to see what the message read.

"Congratulations on conceiving, Eposi. As a gift I thought I would send you a special guest to wish you and your dark elven partner all the worst. Just because your lover handled this threat, does not mean this is over. The next time you conceive, no. the day your children are born, expect another gift of mine to come your way."

Northern America, Region 1

Likewise, Thyia and Benjamin were outside of their home not far from where the chimera had died. The former coast guard was lying down on a field of grass while his grey elven fiance healed with magic. She kept her hands raised above his chest and moved them up and down his body and along his limbs and neck. His body, his bones and muscles might have been broken and torn had he not covered his entire body with bulletproof clothing and vests. Regardless, his body did sustain broken bones and major bruising. 

Thyia's glowing hands were like tiny little tendrils that massaged and repaired damages to his body wherever they hovered over. He felt both amazing and pain all at the same time.

"Aagh...fucking...God damnit!" Benjamin grunted in pain.

"I know it hurts, but I need to piece these broken bones together or else your going to have bone fragments scattered in your body, and that's no good. Also...I know why that monster appeared, Benjamin. I'm guessing you know too."

"Yeah, I think you nailed the reason back then. Why on earth would it want our unborn children? We haven't done anything to anyone or anything. We're the only people here for thousand of miles. Where do you think it could have come from, I mean, nothing like that creature should exist and yet there it is."

"I could feel its blood lust, its hatred for the life inside of me, Benjamin. What if this isn't the last we see of it."

"If this isn't the last time, then next time we will be prepared. We have to be."

**Australian Capital Territory (Australia)**

Australia/ Oceania, Region 26

Down under, away from the chaos and turmoil happening in America, Africa and Mexico. In Australia, Miyuki and Brandon were getting ready to come together in holy matrimony. Because their only allies, Methild and Eposi were busy in their own country with the aftermath of their encounter with the humanoid monster that tried to kill them. They were unable to attend and view their wedding via face time. Regardless whether they had guests or not, Miyuki was not going to let that get her down. She created a whole room of sentient creatures made entirely of from both snow and ice. They would act as her witnesses and audience. The creatures varied in appearance. Some were traditional looking snowmen. There were even snow women, but unlike her. 

Brandon Evans stood at the altar of a cathedral that was frozen over and had magical snowflakes falling from the ceiling from a large misty cloud. It was clearly a display of magical power from Miyuki. He wore an alabaster white tuxedo with silver lining interior. A blue rose that let out mist was attached to his lapel. His dress shoes and gloves were silver toned as well as was his tie. His hair was styled in a side part haircut. This moment in life was perhaps the only time he ever felt and looked good for anything. The interior of the cathedral was lit with white burning fire that created no heat. They burned in hanging braziers made of ice. Everything looked like a scene out of a fantasy novel, and the only thing missing was the enchanting princess or in his case, a bride.

The doors of the cathedral opened. Brandon looked forward down the long aisle at his enchanting wife to be. She wore the whitest dress he had ever laid his eyes on. Her veil that reached from her head down to the floor around her, was made or rather woven from perpetual mist. In her hands she carried not a bouquet of roses, but a large snowball that let out blue mist. Miyuki had dark blue eyeliner that accentuated the shape of her already beautiful eyes. Her lips were as blue as the ocean, and her eyes a deep silver. She looked his way and smiled, blushing also. 

Brandon blushed back at his blushing wife to be and stood upright and ready to receive her hand as she offered it to him. This was not a Shinto style wedding, nor a christian one. In fact, it was not even a religious one. Miyuki said nothing to Brandon except only continuing to smile at him as she created a wedding ring for him, that she placed around his ring finger. It was cold, absolutely cold. He felt like his finger would snap off. The cold subsided from him and the temperature in his finger returned to normal.

"Brandon, take this snowball and...eat it, all of it."

"Yes Miyu...wait, what?! You want me to eat that? Why?"

"Because this is me, at least this is me in my real form."

"So if that snowball is your real form, what do I call this human form of yours standing in front of me?"

"This form you see in front of you is my idealized physical projection of my true self. Yuki Onnas look and feel like women in order to lure men. And when we have them, we ensnare them, murder them or marry them. Either choice we decide powers us, sustains us, but only marriage sustains us the longest. With no one else around but us for the time being, marrying me will sustain me as long as you live. And because I love you Brandon, I love you."

"Okay, if you think this is the right thing, I hope I don't hurt you!" 

The snow woman watched Brandon eat the snowball like he was eating a giant meatball. Try as she might, she couldn't hold back her laughter. He stared back at her, cheeks swollen with snow that quickly turned to water inside. 

"What's so funny?" Brandon asked with a full mouth.

"I was joking about that snowball being me silly, Yuki Onnas only have one body!" 

"Miyuki, how could you!? Isn't this supposed to be serious, we're getting married!"

"I'm sorry, I'm sorry." Try as she might to catch her breath and calm herself, she couldn't. 

Brandon through the snowball over his shoulder and grabbed Miyuki, pulled her in by her back and told her, "I now pronounce us husband and wife, and now I will kiss you."

He tilted her down a bit, making sure to hold her up as their lips connected and their tongues swirled around inside the other's mouth. Their union was now official. All that remained was to reproduce and repopulate Australia. 

***Moscow, Russia***

Northern Asia/ Russia, Region 20

"Aw fuck, yes Karev, fuck that pussy! Hah! Hah! Aaahhh! Put your strong son inside me!" 

"God damnit! There is so much ass! And this fucking pussy...its going to drain my fucking balls!" Yelled Karev Konstantin, a 6 foot tall former Russian Spetsnaz soldier. 

Kneeling down on all fours in front of him, with her large round dark teal colored ass pressed back against him, was a 11 foot tall female storm giant with large globular breasts that swung back and forth like two beach balls in front of her. She had long silvery hair that stuck to her sweaty face and neck in the midst of fornicating with her human lover. Karev, a strong man with large, strong arms and a pair of vice like hands held tightly onto her hips that were as wide as far as he could extend his arms outwards to his side. 

The skin of his groin slapped vigorously against the ass of his giant lover. His storm giantess lover, whose name was Valina, relished her tiny lover's passion and his control he had over her. 

"Yes Karev! Just like that, fuck me, you tiny human man! Put your son inside of me right now!" Valina shouted. 

"Ah fuck, i'm going to fucking impregnate you in just a few minutes!" 

"Hah! Hah! Ha! Haahhh!!" Shouted the giant woman. 

She straightened herself and allowed Karev to wrap his arm around in front of her waist. With a sense of urgency and fiery passion, the former Russian Spetsnaz slapped his crotch against the large round and soft ass of his giant lover. His climax came like a bolt of lightning that froze his entire body and caused him to shake from the waist down. Valina, hissing through her teeth, held her human lover closer to her by pressing his chest against her back with her large powerful hands. He kissed and licked her back eagerly, while one hand played with clitoris which was larger than his thumb. He stroked it like a miniature penis and felt her walls contract and vibrate wildly around his cock.

Like a broken fire hydrant, Valina squirted, wetting the entire floor they were on. With a pained looked and look of shock on his face, Karev held on tightly as strong as he could as his cock was squeezed and milked for all it was worth. His already sweaty face covered in film of sweat turned red and his knuckles turned white from keeping his hands locked together firmly. With every spurt of hot cum firing out of him, Karev felt his strength quickly leave him till he could no longer hold on to his giant lover. Fall back, the former soldier panted deeply, trying desperately to get as much air into his burning lungs as possible. Valina, turned to look behind her and laid on her side beside him. 

"For such a tiny man, you take me like a a fully grown male storm giant," Valina told him, "I can't believe I almost tried to kill you."

"What do you mean tried to kill me? You were trying to kill me. If it wasn't for my special forces training, I would be dead and you would be left alone to wander about all of mother Russia with nothing to do."

Valina thought about what he said and closed her eyes to think back to a week ago when they first met. 

**One Week Ago**

Opening his eyes in what felt like a long time, special officer Karev Konstantin, awoke to a new day. Last night he and his squad were being put through training from hell by their superiors to check to see if they had been slacking off or not. Needless to say, aside from the usual lazy bastards in his squad, he and the rest his squad proved they were in peak and ready condition for their next missions. He looked around his room to see if the other guys were up. His room consisted of three other bunk beds, his included. They were empty. None of his squad member's clothes were anywhere to be seen. He got up and went around to see if there was anyone else around. He found no signs of life either inside his barracks or outside of it.

"Could Russia and the west have finally done it? Could this be...nuclear holocaust?" he wondered to himself. 

"No, that's impossible," he said dismissively, but then looked up above him and saw something that made him everything he knew, "what in heaven's name is that!" 

Situated on top of a giant white lone cloud in clear blue skies, was a giant castle. It was not a castle like the one saw in fantasy books. It was a medieval looking castle that looked like it belonged in England. The former soldier wondered if he was still asleep and just dreaming. Perhaps this was one of those extremely lucid dreams he had heard about but never experienced. The air around him went dry for a moment, but it seemed to last forever. Then everything went quieter than before, before he saw a flash of light; a very bright flash of light originate from above him where the castle hovered over from.

All of his danger signals fired off at the same time. His body instinctively lurched forward, moving out of the way. A giant bolt of lightning struck the spot he was standing only a mere moment ago. One by one with luck no human should ever have, Karev avoided getting struck by one lightning bolt after another. His heart began to beat like no other time before in his life. The adrenaline rushing through his body was only comparable to the time he came close to dying in the Chechen battlefields. From the castle on high, a giant lone cloud with a lean giant woman with dark teal colored skin, descended down. 

The giantess had long silvery hair that hung down over in front of one shoulder. She wore golden armor that covered her torso, her upper shoulders, back, wrists and ankles. She had on a circlet that gave her the appearance of having golden outstretched wings beside her head, like those of a dove. Stepping off of her cloud, she looked, no, stared sharply at Karev and simply analyzed him at first. The lone and sweaty human could only remain frozen where he stood. Too afraid to move for fear she might fire another bolt of lightning at him, and at this range, there would be no avoiding It. 

The giantess's hair glowed a bright white with an accompanying electrical hum that surrounded them. Her eyes glowed brightly as if she was preparing to attack Karev again, but the glow in her hair and eyes dimmed and vanished, as did the electrical humming which went away. In a thick Russian accent, she asked him,
