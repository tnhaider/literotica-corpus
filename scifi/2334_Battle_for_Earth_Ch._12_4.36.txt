Day 30

**Australian Capital Territory (Australia)**

Australia/ Oceania, Region 26

Lying in bed completely naked with her kimono lying on the floor. Miyuki rubbed her small distended belly lovingly. Snow women like her did not require sleep, they could feign sleeping when they were in the house of potential prey to make it easier to feed on them or kill them. But this one strange time was the first time she could recall that she did not have to feign sleep. In her sleep she dreamed about her entire life up to the point of becoming a Yuki-Onna. She was only sixteen years old when she got married to a local lord. But despite being truly in love with her lord husband, he had other prettier and more mature women whom he preferred to spend more time with. One day on her way out of the palace grounds to explore the outside world, she saw a lot of interesting sights and sounds and met all kinds of sweet people who all wished to see the lady of their lord. Before meeting her, everyone talked about what the young lady might have looked like or sounded like. But when they finally met her, they were all smitten.

But the common people were not the only ones smitten with her. There was another, a young man around her age who was among the crowd, took one glance at her serene and gentle kind expression and was instantly taken by her. She noticed this young man and smiled back at him. Her smile, unlike the neutral one she gave to everyone else who surrounded her, was filled with genuine interest for him. Days turned to night and night turned days. The two met up any and every chance the lord was away on business or occupied with his concubines. Their time together filled the young lady with happiness, joy, life and love. But their time together was not meant to last nor was it destined to last forever. One night when she was meant to meet up with him on a hill top known only to them, she waited for him, though he did not appear. 

When she heard rustling in the nearby bushes, she thought it would be her friend to come join her at last. But when she saw that it was her lord husband accompanied by his guards, her heart sank into the bottom of her stomach.

"I know you've been sneaking out to go meet with your little friend, Miyuki. Whose wife are you again? Remind me." her lord husband asked coldly.

Miyuki remained silent. She could do nothing except look down at the ground her feet stood on. He smiled mischievously at her, even devilishly. He took his wrist and lead her to an unknown location somewhere on the hill. She he could hear her heart hammering away in her ears from her increasing anxiety. Everything about this situation screamed danger to her. The darkness of the night was kept away by the lit torches of the guards that flanked them. Shadows danced all around them. When they reached their destination, Miyuki was shown what had happened to her young blossoming love. She fell to her knees, eyes going dead along with the natural light in them. 

Her husband knelt down on one knee beside her and whispered into her ear. "Are you mine or his?" 

"...to...ll" she muttered softly and quietly.

"What did you say?!" 

"I said... GO TO HELL!!" Miyuki shouted. She grabbed the handle of his sword that he carried with him at all times and shoved the blade through his throat. Blood sprayed out of his mouth and ran down his nostrils. 

With his last words, he commanded his guards to kill her, and so they did. Remembering her death caused her to stir in her sleep.

EDITING 

Anxious father to be Brandon, sat on a lawn chair wondering what life was going to be like the moment his child or children were born. The sun for the most part was bright and hot today. Their were hardly any clouds obstructing the beautiful blue sky today.

"I wonder what its like going to have to change diapers. Ive seen videos on that subject but I never thought I would actually be doing it. Oh crap! Baby food, baby clothes! Where am I going to find all of these things?!" Brandon jumped out of his chair and looked around, making rapid darting eye movements. 

As he jumped out of his seat, the clear skies darkened terribly. There was a slight rumbling of the ground that caused him to look down at his feet. The ice sentinels Miyuki placed outside of the walls of the Lodge, snarled and growled at some unknown threat that made its presence known to them. Brandon heard the sentinels fighting with the threat, but to his shock and terror, the sentinels were disposed of quickly. The strange creatures that disposed of the sentinels peered over the walls and for the first time Brandon could see what they looked like. They were white and black amorphous beings with their two main colors taking on many shapes and patterns on their bodies. They lacked any real facial features save for two deep black or white eyes. They were as thin as pencils or as bloated as beach balls and ranged from different heights. 

They tore through the walls and walked towards Brandon, whom took off running back towards the Lodge. Almost as if by coincidence, his phone vibrated from a message he received from Eposi, his ally in Africa. He pulled out his phone and read the message.

Message: Brandon this is Eposi, I forgot to mention to you. But if your partner conceives from your coupling, be prepared to confront strange monsters. We are in a battle for survival here, not just for our species but for the entire world. I wish you and your partner luck. 

Brandon's eyes widened. Sweat formed alongside his face. "Miyuki, wake up! Wake up, there are monster's coming for us!" he yelled towards the lodge. 

As if on cue, Miyuki shot her eyes open and dressed herself with the aid of her powers. She phased through the wall of her home as a cloud of mist and told Brandon to head back inside while she took care of the threat.

"You want me to leave you all alone out here with those monster?! Absolutely not! You're pregnant, which means their aren't here just for you, but for all three of us!" Brandon hollered. 

He reached underneath their bed and pulled out a pump action shotgun and a belt filled with shells. He walked outside and joined his wife to fend off this swarm of monsters who came for their child. Miyuki did not want her husband to be outside with her. She did not want him getting involved in any potential crossfire. So in order to keep him alive while not restricting his movements. She formed armor plating made of ice that levitated an inch off his body and his limbs. The armor as a whole looked mirrored that of a samurai. Brandon looked himself over but had no time to worry about what was on him. 

The amorphous beings shifted from walking to running. Some which looked like giant bears and leopards ran at top speed toward Miyuki. With a wave of her hands, she created long katanas in both of her hands and used them with deadly reflexes and precision. She swung and sliced with such grace it was like she was almost dancing around each beast that came at her. Brandon on the other hand tried not to move to far away from her, firing at every enemy, big or small that came after him. But unlike Miyuki who didn't need to stop to check on her weapons. Brandon needed to stop reload his firearm, which was a mistake in this battle. Seemingly from out of nowhere, a massive swarm of tinier amorphous monsters and creatures the size of human fingers and hands surrounded him. Only managing to reload two of his twelve shells, he fired buck shots to his left and right to kills hundreds of finger sized creatures.

They began to jump on top of him, smashing and ripping the armor plating from his icy suit of armor. Miyuki noticed her lover in trouble and lowered the temperature of his armor so that whenever an enemy was touching him, they froze instantaneously and shattered into thousand of pieces upon falling on the ground. 

"Brandon, use the katana I gave you!" She said screaming. 

He heard her holler at him. He dropped his firearm and grabbed the handle of his icy sword. Although he was a complete amateur handling melee weapons, his knowledge of video games and movies where characters handled swords, gave him an idea of how to use it. Holding tightly onto the sheath of the sword with his right hand, he pulled his sword out and swung in a horizontal arcing motion, sending out a blast of cold air in front of him that knocked the creatures all back, then a sudden loud blast came that created a frozen wave of thousands of sharpened ice spikes that speared enemies in front of him and at his flanks. 

Brandon could hardly believe his eyes while his hands trembled from the power and kick the blade packed. With renewed confidence, he sliced through the remaining enemies by his side. To finish off the last hundred enemies that came for her, Miyuki formed an icy dome with spikes protruding outwards and changed the weather above her quickly. First, soft flakes of snow began to fall, then large light post sized shards of ice rained down on everyone and everything. After this last assault was finished, the skies began to brighten. She undid the icy dome she hid herself in and only after making sure the enemies were all dead, undid the armor protecting her husband.

"Is it done, are they all d-"

"Yes dear, their all dead. I cant see or feel anything else, for now."

"Miyuki, I know why they were here."

"You do?" 

"Yes. Apparently if a couple successfully manages to conceive, then monsters will come for them. My ally from Cameroon texted me. I'm not sure if it was coincidence, but thank God we got this piece of news when we did."

Brandon stared at his wife who was looking forward at something. He walked over to her, wrapped an around her back and looked at what she was staring at. Flying down and perching on a dead body of a giant amorphous creature was a white raven.

"A white raven?" Brandon said, surprised by it. 

"Congratulations couple of region 26. I knew well that you were going to make it. You should feel at ease Brandon," the raven spoke with a deep but calming yet dark tone, "this Yuki-Onna is proving to be your shield and sword. I will come back when your next child is conceived or when it is born."

"Hold on a second!" Brandon yelled out to the vanishing raven. 

The white raven blinked his eyes and stared back at him. "Why are you doing this! Why did you let this happen?!" 

"...why? Because I am sick and tired of all of you. I am tired of everything I create always breaking down. From the invisible amoeba, to the mightiest angel and cruelest demon. If I create a million humans, only one thousand of you will prove to be worthy of my kingdom, but the ratio of successful creations and the failures don't come close to the effort of creating all of you worth it. Reflect back on your life Brandon Evans and you will see that you too were a failure in your past life. Now is your chance to redeem...yourself."

Seated on a rock with one leg crossed over the other. Elred watched his lover firing arrows from the bow he made for her. She aimed and fired arrows at clay pots fired from mechanical traps. It's been two weeks since she was presented with her bow from her elven lover. And on her head she wore a wooden circlet that was enchanted to keep her safe from danger. But in that time also, the two of them united together not in holy matrimony, but in mere desire of the flesh. Elred, for as hard of a tough front he loved to put on, he really did love Roxane. There was also something different about her. She was with child. On her small distended belly she had elven spells painted onto her skin, to speed up the gestation period so as to allow her to birth their children quicker without compromising the development of the fetus. 

Handling her bow with steady hands, Roxane controlled her breathing and let loose wooden arrows with blunt heads and struck seven out of ten clay pots that were flung into the air by the mechanical traps. The sound of the pots shattering on contact with the arrows brought a smile to Elred. 

"You've gotten better Roxy, much better."

"Thank you you big—did you just call me 'Roxy'?"

"I didn't, your ears are lying to you."

"Oh my god even after all of this time together, you still don't want to show me your true feelings. What are you going to lose by showing me your true self?"

"My dignity as an elite sun warrior elf." Elred answered quickly. 

"There are no more sun elves Elred, its just you. No one is watching you. Go ahead and say it. 'Roxy, I love you.'"

"You are carrying my seed, that should be enough to tell you that I lo...you."

"Excuse me?! I AM carrying your child, so you I deserve to hear you say those three words fully from your mouth. Hold on a second..." Roxane said trailing off into thought.

"I almost said it, that should be close enough for you. Roxane, is everything ok?" 

"I just realized that I'm pregnant right now."

"Yes, and that's a good thing. It means our species will continue through our children." Elred commented. 

"I just remembered something. Something Benjamin told me during a video chat last week. He said when his elven lover learned that she had conceived, a monster came for her. They had to do everything in their power to kill that monster. I think he also showed me a picture of the corpse after his lover killed it with numerous lightning strikes."

"Numerous...lightning strikes?" Elred said curiously. "That means that sufficient amount of magic has returned to this once religion infested world. Which means my vast reservoir of magic has finally returned to me."

"What if...what if it's our turn Elred? What if monster show up today or tomorrow, what will we do?"

"If that day ever comes, don't worry about it. Let me deal with them, all of them."

**Washington D.C, Maryland (USA)** 

Northern America, Region 1

Benjamin took little time to rest and relax while he learned to harness magic and craft an attack. Since the day he started to learn he dedicated more and more time to learning than to sleeping or eating and drinking. Thyia, his elven lover was swimming in the pool to calm herself and provide energy and stimulation for their child growing inside of her. Swimming reduced her stress and helped her in more ways than Benjamin would understand. Her clothes which only consisted of her white dress, which meant she was skinny dipping. 

Back over to him, Benjamin could finally feel it. The area where magic was concentrating at. It was at the palm of his hands, he felt a quick tingling but pulsing sensation that tickled him but soon changed and became more uncomfortable to the point where it now felt painful. He murmured the spell for harnessing and controlling electricity, to himself and stretched his arms out. Bands of snapping and crackling electricity arced from his opened palms. Closing his eyes and imaging as hard as he could that he had in his hands were spears of lightning. The arcs of lightning flailing around him stabilized and constricted together to form giant spears of lightning. 

Thyia felt the surge of magical energy like a magnetic pull on her senses. She saw a surge of brigh light from the location Benjamin was training at. She stepped out of the pool and went over to Benjamin naked. She stopped and stood in awe, staring at her lover wielding large spears of stabilized electricity in his bare hands. 

"Benjamin, you did it, you finally did it" she said proudly and smiling. 

He could do nothing but smirk back at her. He looked upwards at the evening sky. He gripped the spears tightly and fired both of them up at the sky. Each time he released them, and watched them rocket towards the clouds, a loud earth shaking thunderous boom sounded shortly after. 

"I have the hang of it now Thyia."

"Benjamin I—I, ow, aaugh!" 

"Thyia, what's wrong?!" he asked quickly, giving her a helping hand. 

"I think it's them, our children...i think their ready to come out!" 

"What? But its barely been one month?" 

"I don't know how to explain it right now, but I really need you to carry me back to the pool Benjamin. I need to give birth to them in the water. Right now!"

"Ok, ok. Lets get you back to the pool then" 

***Moscow, Russia***

Northern Asia/ Russia, Region 20

"I was beginning to wonder if you were ever going to conceive Valina, but I knew my proud strong Russian seed would not disappoint." Karev told his giant lover, seated on the seat of the former Russian president. 

Valina walked around the large and opulent presidential room of the Kremlin. She turned her armor in for a handmade loose fitting form that didn't hug her body to tightly nor did it hang to loosely. It was just tight enough to reveal a small distended belly. 

"I truly desire for our child to be taller than me, if he is a man of course. But if she is a woman, than I desire for her to be smaller than me or equal to me."

"We won't be able to tell until the child is born, Valina. I have been reading the posts of these others human survivors on Message the World. They've been telling each other and sending each other videos about random things. But one thing that has me concerned is what these other pairs have shared with each other after their female partners conceived."

"What are they saying, tiny husband?"

"Their saying that after learning that they have conceived, monster of varying forms shapes and sizes appeared to all of them. Their target appeared to be the developing fetuses. One human man named Brandon writes that when he asked a talking white raven why it was doing this, it seemed to speak as if it were God himself. Of course he writes that he's unsure of what or who that talking raven was."

"Oh Nayush te da!" Valina uttered something in her native language.

"What is it my love?" Karev asked. 

Valina stared out a window. She was looking at something, something so dreadful it filled her eyes with shock and horror. Karev stood up from his seat and went over to see what his lover was staring silently at. Standing in the middle of Ivanovskaya square, was a 20 foot tall giant man in fur clothing and leather armor. Although one could not tell with his armor on. He was quite big in terms of muscles. In his hand was a battle axe, gripped tightly, ready for battle. But unlike his lover whose skin was bright with life, this other giant's skin looked aged, pale and most of all, dead. 

"Valina, who is that? Is that another giant?"

"Yes Karev, its another giant. It's my dead husband. Somehow he's come back from the dead."

"If that's true, then he's not alive anymore. Take a closer look at him. He's-"

"He's undead." Valina said.
