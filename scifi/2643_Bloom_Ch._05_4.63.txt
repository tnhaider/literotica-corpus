 Chapter 5: Jasiri

The men were still angry at Jasiri for the stunt he'd just pulled off, although their anger was abated somewhat by the news of his discovery.

Lawrence cheered and patted him on the back.

"That was awesome!" Lawrence told him.

Jasiri smiled. Although his smile was tinged with worry.

"The demons look alert! Some of them are climbing the mountain from the north as we speak!" he warned.

"They must have seen the smoke from the pyres. I think it's time to prepare an ambush of our own!" Lawrence exclaimed.

Jasiri was quite enthusiastic at the prospect, and it showed.

"We will set up traps, and we will wait." Jasiri spoke.

"In that case, I have an idea for a great trap." Lawrence said.

"What kind of trap would that be?" One of the men asked with suspicion.

"You'll see. We'll have to go to my cave to get what we need. It's not too far off." Lawrence informed them.

After consulting for a few minutes, they scattered to gather some items for the traps.

Jasiri and Lawrence headed for the cave.
