 "Leave us." said Iloni. 

- "I want to speak to him." said Aneli. 

- "And so you shall." said Iloni. But she directed the soldiers to bind my feet to the chair legs, and to tie my hands behind my back. That done, she ordered everyone out of the room. Still, Aneli delayed. 

"I'm sorry, Cook - for the indignity. We had to ... make certain that you would give us time to explain." said Aneli. "Please listen. You have to listen." She was wringing her hands, almost pleading with me. 

- "You'll have your chance to speak to him, as we agreed." said Iloni. 

- "I know." Aneli cast me one last look. Then she hung her head, a little, and left the room. 

Aneli had betrayed us. Ishana, too, and that struck me like a physical blow. She was the leader of my bodyguards, and she'd saved my life on several occasions. But now Ishana had handed me to my enemy. 

How could I have missed that? More importantly, how had Kanitz been so wrong? And Koroba, Nasta, and Madze ... how had Ishana kept her impending treachery a secret from them? 

I had no doubts about where I stood with Iloni. She was the Dragon Lady, the dark counterpart to Kanitz, who enjoyed intriguing because it made her feel powerful, and vital. 

As far as I was concerned, she was directly behind the assassination attempts on Tallia and me, as well as Krayt's attack at her party and the plots to ruin the royal wedding - and get me killed, at the same time. 

I understood how she could easily manipulate males to do her bidding. She was a hot little baggage, with her long, dark hair, and her perfect features. Her pert little tits were popped up under her shirt. 

Iloni's appeal was more than visual; it was olfactory, and almost tactile. I could feel her presence, as if she was on the verge of going into hemmer. It was a remarkably intense sensation, which many Westron males would have been powerless to resist. 

What I couldn't understand was how she managed to exert so much influence over female Westrons. Why would Aneli listen to her? And Ishana ...? 

- "Still thinking, aren't you, Cook?" she said. "Planning, scheming ... looking for a way out." 

She perched her shapely little ass on the edge of the table. 

"You're in no danger, you know. We aren't going to hurt you - or your friends. In fact, we're here to ask for your help." 

I didn't answer. 

When you're wrestling - especially Greco-Roman wrestling - you don't over-extend your arms. Never give your opponent a wrist or an elbow to grab on to. I kept my mouth firmly shut. 

"You must realize how badly the Kingdom is being mismanaged." she said. Iloni looked me in the eye as she spoke. It wasn't quite hypnotism, but it was pretty damn close. 

"Maia Matila is cold-hearted. She doesn't stop to count the cost to her people ... their lives, their hard-earned money ..." 

"You have to admit, Cook, that if it wasn't for you, we'd have lost this war. And the last one, of course. Tonol would have fallen, had you not been there ..." 

"Don't look so surprised. Brune is my friend, and a skillful politician, but we both know that she's a second-rate general, at best." 

I was surprised to hear Iloni speaking this way. But she was messing with my mind. I grit my teeth, and refused to play along. 

- "This war could be over, by now." she continued. "And the Queen could improve her government by including the talents of more of the nobles - instead of limiting herself to a handful of officials of limited ability." 

"I so would have liked to work with Kanitz, you know. But she refuses to share power. The patronage of the Crown is a powerful tool - its benefits should be more widely spread than they are at present." 

"Don't you agree?" 

Iloni waited for me to answer. I didn't say a word. 

She adjusted her shirt, and fiddled with one of her buttons. I'm only human; I looked. 

- "You could have so much more, Cook. The Queen and Kanitz use you to fight their battles, but have they rewarded you?" 

Yes, I thought. More than you know. 

"You should have a title, and land - at the very least." said Iloni. "I would grant you those, immediately." 

"But as it happens, I already know what you really want." 

- "Oh?" I said. That was a mistake - I shouldn't have opened my mouth. 

- "Oh, yes." said Iloni. "But let's begin with the smaller favors, shall we?" 

"I can ensure that nothing happens to your lovers. The sisters? They can continue unmolested. And your children by them as well." 

"Likewise your Penchen lover. We bear her no ill will. We can let her Change run its course - what is that? Another few months? I can promise you that no harm will come to any of your women." 

She was making it very clear that she and her confederates could hurt my friends, if they wanted to. A naked threat, disguised as an offer. 

- "I'm not your enemy, Cook." she said. Damn - Iloni was so persuasive that I almost believed her, for a moment. Almost. 

"I've only ever wanted to be your friend. Well ... and your lover." 

I made the mistake of looking her in the eye. 

- "I admit that I'm attracted to you. I think that we would be amazing, together." 

My traitorous dick began to stiffen, under my kilt. 

"Surely you knew what I was offering ...? And that door is still open." 

She was bad, bad, bad, I reminded myself. Yet ... would it be so wrong to fuck her? I could still refuse to do anything else. Right? 

I mentally slapped myself. Think, Cook. She'd said, early on, that they wanted my help. To do what? 

- "But I understand if your loyalties lie elsewhere. It just so happens that we're also in a position to give you your true desire." 

- "Right." I shouldn't have said anything, but I couldn't help scoffing at her plans. 

- "Maia Simonia." 

I tried not to react. But Iloni's smug little grin blossomed into a full-blown smile. 

"I thought that might interest you." she said. 

"Imagine my surprise," she continued, "when General Brune remembered that you arrived at her camp outside Tonol, accompanied by a very blonde aide - named Themis?" 

"I was shocked, though, to learn that you and your lovely aide shared a tent, and that she went into hemmer during the siege of Tonol." 

"Oh, yes, one of Aneli's Captains was there, and she remembers it well." 

I kept my mouth shut. My teeth were firmly clenched once again. 

- "She's a lovely little girl - Tonola, I mean. Very fitting name." 

If I ever got the chance, I was going to kick Iloni's head right off the top of her shoulders. She was threatening my little girl - Themis' daughter. 

- "You could be with them both, more often." said Iloni. "As I've been trying to tell you, I have your best interests at heart, Cook. I believe that you could be very happy, if only you would support us." 

- "Us?" 

- "Let me outline what I propose." she said. "Kanitz would have to go, of course. Honorable retirement, on her estates. A form of internal exile, akin to what she imposed on poor General Vis. That should be no great hardship."  

"Maia Matila would abdicate, in favor of her sister: Maia Simonia." 

I was watching Iloni, as she told me her plans. Her eyes were bright, and her nostrils flared slightly as she outlined her vision. 

"Maia Simonia would be Queen. She would need a new consort, of course. A prominent male, one respected and admired by all ..." 

I was supposed to believe that I was that male. 

- "What would happen to the present consort?" I said. 

- "He could be persuaded to retire to his estates." 

Or murdered, I thought. Krayt was dead, and so, undoubtedly, was the servant who'd let the assassins know when I was leaving the Palace. Iloni and her friends wouldn't shy away from killing again. I wondered if that was Plan B, as far as I was concerned. 

They would try to win me over, and then dispose of me if I refused to cooperate. Of course, even if I agreed to join her, Iloni probably wouldn't hesitate to get rid of me the moment it became expedient. 

It might be better, then, to play along, for a while. But I couldn't make it look like I was too eager. Gradual change - nothing too sudden. 

- "Why do you need me?" 

- "You underestimate yourself, Cook. You have support across the classes - and throughout the army, of course." 

"We value your assistance. Your aid. And I believe that you would truly enjoy the benefits of your new position. Maia Simonia. Your Penchen girl. Tudino, and Aneli, and however many other females you chose to service." 

"And of course, you would be working closely with me, in future ..." 

I pretended to think it over. I frowned, as if I was having a hard time of it. Kanitz knew that I was a lousy liar, but I gave it my best effort. 

It was just ... such a stupid plan. 

Iloni had a high opinion of herself, but she didn't know Maia Simonia - Themis - at all, if she thought that the Princess would accept the deposition of her sister, and then agree to take her place. 

- "What ... what would happen to Maia Matila?" I asked. 

- "She would have to face facts - and accept the new regime." said Iloni. 

I swallowed. They were going to kill her. 

- "General Vis would be pardoned?" 

- "Possibly." 

- "No one will accept her re-instatement. I said. "Not after what she did." 

- "You might be surprised." said Iloni. She didn't seem too concerned about it, though. "We could always discuss her status afterwards." 

- "We?" 

- "You and I." she said, with a little shrug. "If you're uncomfortable with Vis, she doesn't necessarily have to be a part of our future plans." 

- "What is it you're asking me to do?" 

Iloni smiled. "We need your support, Cook. Some reliable troops, loyal to you. And your participation, when we form a new government. We would definitely need a Commander-in-Chief, for the Army." 

I heard her words. And yet I knew exactly what she intended. Themis would never be Queen. There would be an accident ... a tragic misfortune of some kind, and Princess Maia Simonia wouldn't stay alive long enough to be crowned. 

Maia Ariana would be the only remaining adult member of the royal family. No doubt Iloni or Brune had a male relative who could marry her, and become consort. 

It was unlikely that they'd need me for long, after their coup - unless Iloni really wanted to ride me that badly. If I accepted the 'new realities', I might be able to stick around for a while, until she tired of me. 

- "I ... I have to think about it." 

- "I understand." said Countess Iloni. 

- "It's just ... hard to think clearly - with you here." 

- "Ah." She'd buy that. Iloni was exceptionally confident of her ability to seduce and manipulate any male who came close enough. She was probably gratified to find my resistance crumbling. 

"I will give you some time, then." 

Iloni stood, and straightened her clothing. She made sure that I saw her shirt puppies, and then her tight little ass as she adjusted her breeches. With a little smirk, she made her way to the door. 

- "Call me when you wish to talk." she said. 

Fuck fuck fuck. 

I was so fucked. How to get out of this, without promising to do what Iloni wanted? That would only lead to the deaths of people I loved and cared about - The Queen, Kanitz ... Themis. 

They wouldn't leave her children alive. Maia Simonia's children by her consort would be ... inconvenient. Even Tonola was probably slated to die. After me, of course ... but I could see the whole plan laid out before me, as if I'd been one of the plotters. 

So many people had to die, or disappear, for this to work. It would be a bloodbath. Others would be taken as hostages, to ensure future cooperation. Tallia. Esyle. Our children. And then killed later, in a second slaughter. 

What would happen to Tudino? Or Avette, for that matter? 

Isa. 

They'd kill her. Or take her hostage, at the very least. She wouldn't live a day longer than I would. These ultra-conservatives were totally xenophobic. 

The door opened again, and Aneli came in. She stopped just inside the door, as if unsure of her welcome. 

- "Are you ... alright?" 

I shook my head. "No, Aneli - I'm not." 

My former patron came slowly, to the edge of the table. She sat down, opposite me. 

- "You have to think clearly, Cook." she said, softly. "This could be so good for us." 

- "Us?" 

- "You could be General-in-Chief." she said. "You could remake the whole army. Introduce your tactics to every single regiment. Wouldn't that be wonderful?" 

- "What would you get out of it, Aneli?" 

She had the grace to blush. "I'm to be Chancellor." 

"Just think of what we could do!" she said. 

I couldn't even begin to imagine that. All I saw was the long list of people who would have to die so that Iloni, Aneli, and their friends could satisfy their ambitions. 

Aneli was a great fuck. I would never forget her bountiful breasts, or her wonderful ass, as she leaned against the wall while I slammed into her from behind. 

But she was prepared to sacrifice people to her greed. Would Iloni actually make Aneli Chancellor? For how long? 

Did they even need Aneli? It might be that her only usefulness to their conspiracy was the fact that she could invite me to her party - and have me show up, to fall into their trap. 

- "You're saying that Iloni doesn't want to be Chancellor herself? What title will she take?" 

Aneli shook her head. "You don't understand, Cook. Iloni doesn't need an official position. She prefers to work behind the scenes." 

You poor, deluded fool, I thought. You can't see that they're only using you. Aneli wasn't going to be Chancellor for long - if at all. 

- "Aneli ..." 

- "We could have everything we want." she said. 

She was in too deep. Aneli was a vain, shallow creature. Kanitz had said it: if the opposition ever figured out what to offer her, she'd join them. 

"Please, Cook ... please ..." 

I finally understood: she was fully committed to this plot, but her rewards were conditional. She had to deliver me. Not only betray me, but also ensure my participation in their coup d'état. 

- "I don't know, Aneli. What sort of guarantee do I have that they won't hurt my friends? Our friends? And who are they, anyway? The only name I know, other than yours, is Iloni. Who else is supporting you?" 

I'd been about to say 'who else is involved' - but 'supporting you' sounded better. It might make Aneli think that she was a major player, instead of a gullible pawn. 

- "General Brune, of course. General Vis." 

- "Vis? Isn't she under house arrest?" 

- "She still has influence. With the aristocracy. With the army. There's also Countess Marbaud -" 

- "The one with the cushion?" 

Aneli smiled. "Yes. Two more Countesses, and several Colonels in the southern army." 

- "What about the central army?" 

Aneli looked away. "I don't know about that." 

She was a worse liar than I was. 

*** 

Aneli tried to get me to commit myself. After an hour, she relented, and agreed to let me eat and drink. They freed my hands, but left my ankles tied to the legs of the chair. 

Iloni came back to check on me. 

- "Is the food to your liking?" she asked. 

- "Are you planning to amputate my feet?" 

- "Pardon?" 

- "The ropes around my ankles are tight enough to cut off circulation." 

- "We can make you a little more comfortable." she said. 

The soldiers came back, and untied me. Four of them escorted me to a small bedroom, which must have belonged to some of Aneli's servants. 

I briefly considered using my martial arts training. I was a little rusty, though - plus two of the soldiers stayed at the door, well out of reach. 

Two of them remained in the room, and watched me as I tried to sleep. 

There were a thousand reasons to stay awake, and try to think of a way out of this. But I was exhausted, and desperately needed rest. Soldiers learn to sleep when they can, regardless of their surroundings. So I did. 

*** 

First thing in the morning, I was led back to Aneli's dining room, and tied to my chair again. Then I was served an excellent breakfast. There were four soldiers from Brune's regiment in the room. 

So far, I'd seen a dozen or so different faces (and hair colours) in Brune's uniform. And I'd also caught of sight of Ishana, with four troopers from the Aneli regiment. 

That was hard to take. Two of them were reasonably new recruits. But the other pair had been at Limset. I couldn't even begin to understand how they could betray me. 

Maybe they had qualms, too; neither one would even glance in my direction - never mind look me in the eye. 

Countess Iloni came into the room. My treacherous dick responded almost immediately. 

Iloni's aura (for lack of a better word) was even more potent today. Then it occurred to me: she's almost ready to go into hemmer. In the next few days, she'd be virtually irresistible. It was bad enough, now, but if she was close by, at the height of her powers, I'd be crawling over broken glass to get at her. 

Her little grin told me that she knew precisely what kind of effect she was having on me. 

Iloni made certain to come very close to me, so that I could smell (and feel) her arousal. That, I realized, was part of Iloni's appeal: she didn't have to wait, like Tudino, to be fully into her hemmer. Iloni could probably wear out two or three males before she was even ready for the main event. 

It was torture. She was close enough that I could have just reached out, and grabbed one of those pert little boobies, or one of the perfect globes of her ass. 

That would have been to embrace defeat. I bit my lip - hard - and resisted the temptation. I thought of Isa ... 

... and realized that Iloni had nothing but lust on her side. 

Had I been younger, and less experienced, I might have been eating out of her hand. But I'd known lust, and love, and even friendly sex. I'd also experienced a variety of hemmers. There were 6 or 7 lovers I'd prefer to be with - rather than Iloni. 

That got me thinking: where was Isa? And Koroba? 

For some reason, Iloni didn't try any verbal persuasion. She also kept Aneli away, for the rest of the day. I was fed again, and then taken back to the room I'd slept in. 

*** 

The next morning, I was again taken to the dining room, tied to my chair, and fed. 

Iloni came to tempt me again. Her scent was even richer, her aura another level of magnitude stronger. 

But I wasn't paying attention to her. 

She'd left the door open - deliberately, I had to assume. I could see two women I knew, standing close together. 

General Vis - and Berandot. 

- "You see her?" whispered Iloni. She was standing right behind me, close enough to rub her little tits on my arm and shoulder. 

- "Uh." I grunted. 

- "I could let you have her." she said. "To do with as you will." 

"You could kill her, if you want to." 

That idea had a certain appeal. 

"Or you could keep her - and fuck her." 

I had another moment of enlightenment: Iloni was a sexual terrorist. She used her powers to manipulate, to control, and to destroy - so she believed that others would do the same, if they could. 

She was offering to let me humiliate and degrade Berandot, to revenge myself on her. 

But my mind was operating separately from my traitorous body. I was painfully erect, wanting nothing but to fuck Iloni, to bend her over the table, and drive my full length inside her, over and over ... 

If not her, I could fuck Berandot. I could sodomize her, rape her ass and - 

That was the Iloni effect. 

My mind was still my own, though, separate from my instincts and my baser urges. I was thinking of a way to use this situation against her.
