 Author's note: this is my entry for the 2017 Lit Halloween contest. Please vote and leave comments if you have the time. All characters appearing in this work are fictitious and are eighteen years of age or older. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental.

This is a quirky Sci-Fi, Rom-Com with not a lot of sex, so if you are looking for a quick wank, you've clicked on the wrong story.
