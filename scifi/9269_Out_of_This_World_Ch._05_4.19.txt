Lincoln, Nebraska Fire Drive, Castillo Residence

It was raining early Friday morning, with thunder rumbling in the dark skies above accompanying the falling rain. Fukayna and Rami slept on a bunk bed in the same bedroom. Azizi and Gahji had their own rooms, and were sound asleep. Gahji tossed and turned on his bed, pulling more of his covers over himself as it poured heavily outside. Most of the interior lights inside of the Castillo home were off. With the only exception being the lights inside of the master bedroom. Sounds of love and lust twisted into a perfect melody that filled the room.

Nicholas straddled Shayna, keeping his knees beside Shayna's arms as she curled them around his thighs. Gently holding the back of her head with both of his hands, he thrusted his hard cock between her large breasts. Nicholas relished the sight of watching his cock sliding in between both of his wife's tightly pressed milk tanks. Seeing her tongue coiled around the head of his cock, pushing in and out of her hot wet mouth was only the cherry on top. The couple's libido was very high with sex taking place before falling asleep, or immediately after waking up early in the morning.

"Oh my...God, Shayna...Huff* Huff* Huff*...fuck." Nicholas panted.

"Mmm! Mmm! Mmm!" Shayna moaned repeatedly. 

Her hands switched from resting on top of her husband's thighs, toward her wet pussy. Her right hand rubbed and pulled on her fat throbbing clitoris that ached for some attention. Her left hand fingered her pussy, sliding two fingers first, then three in and out. 

"Oh fuck!" Nicholas grunted, "Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...Gyaahhhh!" He grunted deeply, inhaling a sharp amount of air and holding the back of Shayna's head forward as ropes of hot semen fired into the back of her mouth. 

Huffing with labored breath, Nicholas watched his wife's long snake like tongue uncoil from around his length and showed him his white cum that was slathered all along the lower part of her flat dagger like tongue. 

"It's your turn to feel good too, sexy" Nicholas huffed. 

He moved downward on her body, stopping on her wet pussy where he took her legs and spread them open. Nicholas placed his head between them when he felt Shayna sharply closed them around the back of his neck. Shayna stared back at Nicholas with a wry smile on her face. 

Nicholas smirked and chuckled, then buried his face in his wife's pussy. First he spread her outer labia apart with his thumbs, then pushed his tongue inside of her hot vagina. His lips clamped down firmly over the rest of her vulva as he circled his tongue around inside of her. Wobbling his head around from side to side and up and down, Nicholas gave Shayna more pleasure like this. Shayna's four toes curled tightly from the pleasure branching around to all ends of her limbs from her husband's tongue. She kneaded her breasts and pulled on her nipples as she grinded her crotch against her husband's mouth.

"Mmmmn! Mmnnn! Mmnnn!" Nicholas moaned against her grinding cunt.

"Yes Nicholas! Yes! Huuhhnnn, eat me! Devour me! Hahh! Hahh! Hahh! Hahh.....aaaaahhh!" Shayna panted and sprayed her juices all over Nicholas's face.

Unwrapping her legs from around the back of his neck, Nicholas got up from bed to wash his face in their restroom. He threw warm water on his face and licked his lips to get some of his wife's juices before the rest of it washed off his face. Finished patting down his face with a dry towel, he returned back to his Shayna. He laid back down with Shayna nestling up close beside him. Wrapping an arm behind her back, Nicholas kneaded the flesh of her soft ass. He threw one of her leg's over his wist just to feel more of her on him. Shayna pressed her large breasts against his chest, wrapping an arm around his muscly obliques and pulled him closer to her. She stared back at Nicholas and kissed him. They kissed and kissed, and kissed some more. Deeply. Passionately. Amorously. With his other hand, Nicholas kneaded one of Shayna's large tits. Coiling her tongue around his and squeezing it lightly, Nicholas and Shayna experienced tiny orgasms from each others kiss. Nicholas, shot out a small amount of semen whilst Shayna squirting a small amount of juice from her pussy.

"Puh!" gasped both of them, as their mouths separated from each other.

"God, Shayna, your such a passionate kisser. Fuck that was intoxicating" Nicholas said.

"It's because I love you so much Nicholas."

"God, can I handle so much love from you?" Nicholas wondered teasingly.

"I know I can. And don't be silly, of course you can."

"Yeah, I know. I was just teasing you" Nicholas chuckled.

Shayna pulled herself over on top Nicholas and wrapped her arms around his shoulders as she laid the side of her face on top of Nicholas's chest. From sex to talking, the mood changed.

"It's Friday" Nicholas said.

"It Is. Would you like to go out tonight? We could leave the kids in the care of Ramona and Janet."

"Maybe. Shayna listen, about the issues your having with the principal."

"Yeah baby?"

"If she tries something like that again. I mean, if she tries it again, send me a text immediately and I will stop what I'm doing at that moment and I will hurry to you. Before we got married, I could have lost you to any man or woman, but after we got married and had two children in our first year. You became my woman, not just my wife, but MY woman. I won't tolerate anyone abusing my wife, or blackmailing her."

"It's not your fault Nicholas. I know you will always be there to protect me and our children. I know that's all you want to do, but the fault lies with me. I could have easily stood up for myself if I wanted to. I could have really hurt Ms. Brown or Morna with my telekinetic abilities. But use of force and violence, even in the case of self-defense, is very difficult for mariners to do. I love teaching snd this is the only high school that's closest to our neighborhood. I promise you that the next time I feel like the principal wants to take advantage of me again, I will contact my man, You Nicholas"

"That's my woman" Nicholas whispered tenderly, hugging her tightly against his chest.

As the couple closed their eyes to get one more hour of rest, Nicholas's phone rang. He reached over to grab his phone from the nightstand beside their bed. He checked to see who it was calling him. The screen showed the avatar of a green gemstone, with the name 'Officer Irons' above it. He pressed the talk button and answered.

"Yes officer irons, what is it?"

"Officer Castillo, hey it's me Rhonda. I know we don't talk with each other very often, nor do we get the chance to back in the department. I wanted to tell you that starting today, I'm going to be your new partner for the next remaining three months of the year, and into the new year. Please guide me and teach me everything you know."

"Oh wow. that's amazing news officer irons. Well I will teach you all I know to the best of my ability. See you at the station in a few, okay? Alright, later" Nicholas said.

"That was a woman's voice," Shayna pointed out, "Who is she?"

"That was a fellow female officer named Rhonda Irons. She's the new rookie in the department whose been riding around with veteran officers, being taught the ropes on procedures and protocols. She's been assigned to me as my new partner. Actually, she's going to be my first partner. I never told you this Shayna, but I've been riding alone for the past seven years.

"Is she pretty, Nicholas?" 

"Are you worried about me Shayna?"

"Yes, and a little jealous" Shayna said, not holding her feelings back.

"Don't be Shayna. Have I ever cheated on you during our whole marriage?"

"No, no you haven't. What do you think it would be like if we were partners, Nicholas?"

"If you were my partner, i would have to keep the eyes of all the guys in the department off of your ass. I'd be walking behind you all the damn time. I don't want those ravenous dogs undressing you with their eyes."

"Heh heh, sounds like someone is also the jealous type."

"Damn right I am" Nicholas and Shayna laughed together.

Too distracted by each others laughter. Neither Nicholas or Shayna heard their bedroom door creak open. "Hey mom..." Azizi, the third oldest child, uttered as she entered their bedroom. Immediately, Shayna threw the covers over Nicholas's nakedness. 

"Honey, Azizi baby what's wrong?" Shayna asked her daughter, getting up out of bed to go over to walk her daughter out of the room. Azizi opened her eyes and saw her naked mother walk over to her. 

Seeing her mother nude was not uncommon, as all of the kids showered with their mother at least until their second year which was ten years old in earth years. But Nicholas, their father was a different story. When Azizi glanced over at her father for a moment, shirtless and covered in perspiration. She shut her eyes and turned around on her heels quickly. Shayna escorted her daughter out of their bedroom and walked her back to her bedroom. Shayna returned back to her bedroom to put on a pair of panties and a bra, then returned back to check on her daughter.

"Is everything alright Azizi?"

"No, i feel sick. I think its the rain making me feel like this. Can I stay home?" 

"Baby i can't miss work today, and neither can your father. But if you want to, I can leave you in the care of Mike and Marvin."

Azizi nodded and laid back down on her bed. Shayna walked back inside of her bedroom and told Nicholas she was preparing to go to work.

**Lincoln Police Department**

9:00 AM 

Driving into the basement garage of the police department building in his assigned patrol car. Nicholas stepped inside of the elevator and headed up to the second floor where his desk was. Nicholas didn't like wearing the entire police uniform, instead he wore a white muscle shirt or dark blue one under his bulletproof vest. On the left breast of his vest was his name embroidered on it, with the department acronym 'LPD' on it on his right breast. Nicholas stepped out of the elevator when it reached the second floor. Nicholas greeted all of his friends and fellow officers on his way to his desk. He hugged some veteran officers who came and greeted him and waved at more far off officers who greeted him. Waiting for him at his desk, seated on his chair was rookie officer Rhonda Irons. Officer Irons was a slim Caucasian blonde woman, with an athletic body type. Her hips were wide, she had a large ass and had small breasts. She sported an asymmetric cut hairstyle that complimented her heart shaped face.

Rhonda had grey eyes instead of blue or green for being a blonde. Wore just a little bit of eyeliner and seemed a little guarded but eager to make new friends. Rhonda stood up from her seat when she spotted Nicholas coming over to his desk. Nicholas exhaled nervously and put on a smile for Rhonda.

"Nichol—I mean officer Castillo! It's really nice to meet you."

"Good morning officer Irons. It's a pleasure to finally meet you. Let me grab a few papers from my desk and we can head back to my patrol car in a bit."

Officer Irons smiled at Nicholas as he shot her a kind smile. He grabbed an envelope with papers in them and lead the way back to the elevator. All day the pair spent the day driving around the city, answering emergency dispatches. They were called out to settle a domestic call. Called out to deal with homeless people sleeping on bus stations. They were even called out to 'humanely euthanize' a coyote that snuck its way inside of a home with children inside of it. Aside from his job, the other thing bearing down on his mind was his wife, Shayna. He hoped she was doing alright today. He dreaded possibly receiving a text from her asking for his help, partly because if he found her with the principal in a compromising position. He wasn't sure if he would be able to keep his gun holstered. 

**1:00 PM**

Stopping by a fast food joint to grab some lunch, Nicholas and Rhonda stepped out of their patrol car to eat their food in the parking lot. The day was still dull and grey with overcast skies, but the rain had stopped. Thankfully the rainstorm had been slowly moving away from the city of Lincoln. Nicholas sat on the hood of his car and unwrapped a bacon cheeseburger that he bought from its wrapper and ate it slowly. He kept one arm wrapped over his chest, as he kept his other arm raised to take bites of his burger. Rhonda also sat on the hood of the car and took a bite out of her own burger. From where she was sitting, Rhonda could smell Nicholas's cologne wafting over to her thanks to a passing breeze. It smelled wonderful and made the already handsome officer, that much more appealing in her eyes.

"Hey officer--"

"You can call me Nicholas, when its just you and me Rhonda" Nicholas told his partner flatly.

"Right. Nicholas, can I tell you something real quick ans pardon me if it comes off as bold."

"Sure Rhonda go ahead. Don't feel nervous about it." he said, assuring her.

"You are...a very handsome man, Nicholas. I mean you are just so handsome. I would even dare say you are beautiful in my eyes."

Nicholas was visibly moved by her words, even blushing a bit as he looked away to cover his embarrassment. "Thank you for that compliment, Rhonda. It made my day." 

"If you weren't married, I would have asked you to be my boyfriend."

Nicholas smiled back at her with the silliest smile on his face. A smile which caused the young rookie to turns away from his gaze from embarrassment. "You're a kind and compassionate woman, Rhonda. Perhaps somewhere out there in another universe, this duo is already happily married."

"Right," Rhonda said flatly, still looking away from Nicholas, "But even in that other possibility, i would not be entirely female."

"Come again?" Nicholas asked her.

Rhonda remained silent for ten seconds, before turning to look back at Nicholas.

"I...I was born with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, Nicholas. 'AIS' for short. That means that genetically speaking I am male, but I have the physical traits of a woman. I have small breasts and no pubic hair. I have a vagina but no uterus or ovaries, so I have never gotten my period. Instead I had underdeveloped, undescended testes that I had to get removed from inside me to keep them from becoming cancerous. Do you think you could ever love that person, Nicholas?" 

"Rhonda I...I don't know what to say. Even if you had both a penis and a vagina, it wouldn't matter to me. I mean, I love women. Don't get me wrong, but if you were born that way, that's not your fault. We don't ask how or who to be born as and so what If you don't have a uterus or ovaries. It's not like we as humans could make a child together today even if we wanted to, right? Listen Rhonda, As far as we humans know, we only got this one life to live. If we allow issues like AIS or the infertility of the human race or how we feel about ourselves, then we're not living anymore, we're just suffering. Even when it raining, its important to carry our umbrellas with us. At least then a rainy day doesn't have to be so bad. I'm sorry Rhonda, I'm really not so good at consol--"

Hugging him and pressing a kiss on his lips, Nicholas placed his burger down on the hood of the patrol car behind him. He placed his hands on Rhonda's shoulders and slowly pulled her away from him. Rhonda opened her eyes that she had closed and stepped back in embarrassment.

"Oh my god Nicholas, I-I'm sorry. Its just what you said, and how you were saying it was so beautiful, i just felt like kissing you."

"It's fine Rhonda, don't worry about it. Let's just finish eating our lunch so we can get back on the job."

"Okay. But listen if you ever want to see what it looks like, we could always hang back a little late in the showers and--"

"Rhonda!" Nicholas said her name sternly.

"Just kidding Nicholas. Just kidding." Rhonda said softly.

"Alright then." Nicholas replied.
