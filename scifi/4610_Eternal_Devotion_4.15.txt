 "That fucking bitch," Erin mumbled again as she drunkenly leaned on her friend Paige. "Fuck.. break up with me? Fuck'n I'LL breakup.. with.. and her stupid face.. I don't fuck'n.." she slurred together as Paige helped her into her house. 

"Ok drunky girl.. so there's a garbage can beside you if you feel sick, just try to stay on your side ok?" Erin said as she started tucking her into bed.

"I do feel sick.." she pouted as she began to curl up into a ball.

"Well just try and aim for the trashcan ok?" Page said as she went to go move it even closer to Erin's head.

"No not.. how could she.. that? But to me!"

"This is some prime, wait-to-the-morning, stuff here." Erin said as she patted her friend on the back.

"I fuck'n love or I thought.. but No! No it's meh meh meh all the time and. I mean it's like hello? I should have.. it's my place too! She shoulda .. spinning on the couch"

"Look, we'll go by your place some time tomorrow when she's not home, you can grab some of your stuff and crash here for however long you need." Paige said as she started tidying up the room. 

"I'll crash.. I mean all over her face!" Erin said before making herself chuckle at the joke she thought she just made. 

"Of course you will, goodnight," Paige said as she turned off the light and walked back to her room.
