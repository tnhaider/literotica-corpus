 Author's Note: Chapter 21 is nearly written so I thought I would go ahead and submit 16. Hopefully this one will not take as long to be approved as 15 did. If you ever want to know what progress I am making, just look on my profile. I've begun posting updates there. Please be assured, I am going to finish this story. I have the plot worked out and I know how I will be wrapping it up at the end. It's the last few chapters that are giving me trouble. I have to tie everything together and have it all make sense. Often I write half a dozen paragraphs and realize they don't serve the story and end up deleting them. It takes time to get things right. I have no wish to just throw words on the page and let it go. Rambling stories irritate me and I will not write one. I could easily update faster, but I don't think people would enjoy reading this tale if I did.

Many thanks to those readers who have left comments or sent messages. Those sending messages, though, should understand that this is a story with a plot. I'm not going to put in more sex scenes just because you tell me I should. As I have stated several times: If you want that kind of story, either look elsewhere or write your own.

Again, thanks for all the comments and messages. They do keep me motivated to finish this tale.
