**Mexico City, Mexico**

Mexico, Region 2

"Aaahhh!! Cruel Lucifer! Aagghhh!! Why must this hurt so God damn bad!" Menja howled in pain from labor pains. 

The tiny demoness laid on the presidential bed with her husband, Oscar sitting by her side cross-legged. He never once left her side, even when day turned to nigh, which marked the start of his infernal wife's birthing pains. The sun, as though wishing to refuse to bear witness of the birth of Menja and Oscar's hybrid children, seemed to set faster on this day than any other day. As strange as this solar phenomena was, it was far from the strangest thing to happen in this new world. 

Menja's pained howls and growls shook the walls, no, the foundation of the presidential palace to its core. Oscar, soon to be first time father, gave his hand to his tiny wife to hold on to as she pushed their children out of her small grey body. Gripping his hand with the strength of a thousand gorillas, no normal man's hand would have been recognizable after being held as long as his was. Her belly had grown large and fat with her husband's spawn and now one by one, they were slowly coming into the world. With each child delivered, her distended belly got smaller and smaller. 

The first child to come out, came sliding out of his mother in a mixture of blood and green slime. Lightning and thunder accompanied the first born hybrid from one of the many inter-species pairings in the world. Drops of rain fell slowly at first, then an unexpected downpour came over the entire capital. One after another, with each child sliding out from between Menja's legs, lighting struck and thunder rumbled, brighter and louder each time. 

Oscar watched with both amazement and terror at all of his tiny slimy children writhing and crying beneath their mother in a pool of blood and slime. He was initially surprised at how small they were. They were no bigger than a man's thumb. He felt both joy and yet guilty. He was overjoyed to finally have a family of his own, but terrible that he had sired children with a female demon. But how he felt did not matter now at least not in the grand scheme of things. When the last and twelfth child slid out of her, their was a god awful boom that was accompanied by an earthquake that shook the entire capital.

With a powerful gasp of air, Menja sighed tiredly and went to sleep as her slimy children cried underneath her. Oscar released her small hand and moved over to pick up his children, all twelve of them. They appeared to be growing rather quickly in his cupped hands with every passing minute. They looked like tiny echidna babies at first. Seven of them were males while the other five were female. 

"Oscar...put them in that...cauldron..." Menja said tiredly from behind them.

"What cauldron?" He asked her, looking around their bedroom confused.

Menja casually waved her hand and created a large black cauldron from thin air. The large black mass of iron appeared at the foot of their bed. Oscar moved aside and placed all twelve of his children inside of the charcoal black, cold hunk of steel. The tiny demon mother crawled over to the foot of the bed and stood on the bed just behind her husband. She wrapped her small arms behind his back, rested her face on the crook of his neck and spoke into his ear. 

"Boy that was painful and i mean really painful. I thought I was going to die but then I remembered, 'oh that's right I can't die,' nyahahaha. Look at them, squirming around in there and crying. Half of me and half of you. Half mortal, half immortal. Eww some of them look human, but others have weird skin tones so it's aight."

"What do you mean 'Eww'? Their out children, they were formed in your tiny womb." 

"Yeah well, unless they grow up quicker I'm just going to throw them straight to hell as a sacrifice to myself" She said, flicking dirt from underneath her claws.

"No! Menja how can you be so cold, their not even a day old and you're already getting bored of them?" Oscar told her sternly. 

"Hahahaha, look at you, acting so paternal already. Fine, I won't toss them into the fiery abyss to empower myself. But I get to name seven of them, after all I did carry these little shits. But first, let's give them a whole day to finish growing up. I want to see what they'll look like when their fully formed adults. Hmm, now that I think about it, I wonder how Lilith made it look so easy. That was a real whore, bearing children from both angels and men, only to lose them the same night she birth them. Sad. That dumb bitch, served her right."

"Why do you say that?" Oscar asked her.

"Because that bitch was the first woman Lord Ass created, was the first female rebel and was the first in all of creation to bear children."

"You're jealous?" 

"No, I just...shut up Oscar!"

Oscar chuckled to himself as he returned back to watching his children growing up slowly before him.

After feasting on roasted pig that she found and killed and drinking lots of alcohol that she created in great quantity which was enough to kill an entire bar full of people. Menja could think of no other way to pass the day than by fucking. Oscar, pleased that he was now a father to seven boys and five girls, could not nor could he refuse his infernal wife's lustful desires. They fornicated in another room while their children grew and matured into adults in the presidential bedroom. Come the next morning, the cauldron had long been broken into several pieces. Burned imprints of human feet and cloven hooves and giant rat feet from the bedroom, went down the hallway to the room the couple were fornicating in. 

Kneeling down behind his tiny wife. Oscar held onto and pulled back on her long black hair while pounding and slapping away at her wet cum filled pussy. Her large round ass jiggled each time he slapped his groin against her hot skin that was covered in beads of perspiration. 

"Yes! Yes, pull on my fucking hair baby!" Menja hissed happily as Oscar's strong toned lower half slapped against her grey ass. He slapped her ass to get her to tighten around him.

"Yes! Fucking slap my ass too! Haah! Aaahhh! Nngghhhaaaahh!!" 

Menja and Oscar groaned and moaned together. Feeling his balls tightening, he filled her up again with an inhuman amount of cum that leaked out of her already stuffed cunt. The former marine leaned over his tiny wife, cocked her head back and kissed her, all the while as she ground her large ass against him, urging him for more. 

"Now I want you to fill my asshole again. And after that I want to give you two cocks so you can stuff both my pussy and my asshole at the same time, big dick, nyahaha." 

The doorknob behind them turned slowly. The white door of their bedroom creaked open. The hand that opened them was as white as snow. It let go of the knob as the door swung open and hit the wall beside it. Menja and Oscar's attention turned to see who was stepping inside of their room. All twelve of their children stood in line beside one another. They were now fully matured adults and completely naked. Oscar, feeling embarrassed at being seen naked in front of his children, pulled out of his wife's stuffed little cunt and grabbed his boxers from the floor and placed them back on. Menja was more carefree about the whole situation and simply turned around, sat on the edge of the bed resting one leg over the other and stared back at her children. 

The first one she laid her eyes on was without a doubt the tallest, strongest and fittest. He was 9 feet tall with skin as white as new winter snow. The color of his eyes were golden, but his pupils were slitted like his mother's. He had no hair, instead he was bald. And the size of his genitalia, which Menja blushed and giggled at, was impressive in her eyes. 

"Oscar come and sit beside your queen, our children are going to introduce themselves to us. Then afterwards we will give them their names."

Oscar did as she commanded and sat down beside her. 

"You, the white one, come here and kneel before your parents. I will name you first out of all my children." 

The pale cambion looked to his right at his brothers and sisters first. He turned back and stared at his mother nodded his head. He stepped out first from the line among his eleven other siblings and approached his mother with caution. He knelt down on one knee and stared back at her. Menja smiled a cheshire smile the more she stared at what she and Oscar had created together. Pride and amazement filled her very being. She leaned forward without getting off the bed and gently grabbed the chin of her son and looked into his deep yellow eyes. He blinked while she never once did. Inside of his soul that was gifted to him from her, she saw the best areas he would excel at and what his supernatural abilities were.

"You my dear son represent the selfish desire to physically be the best of the best. The fastest and the strongest. You have superhuman, No, Monster level strength and stamina to boast. You might even be stronger than your father, well almost."

When Menja said that his strength equaled his father's, he turned and glared at Oscar. His gaze were like knives cutting deep into him. He saw that his father was initially spooked by his glare, but he did not look away from him. He stared at him until he focused his gaze back on his mother. 

"Hey, hey, Hey! Stop giving your dad the stink eye, the only reason you're here in the flesh is because he shot you inside of me like a champion!" Menja said loudly, tightening her grip on his chin. 

He grimaced from the pain and tried not to make any pained sound. "Good, now that we got you under control, let's think of a name for you. You're bald, sad. You're white like snow, too white if you ask me, but you have my eyes and you have your father's blessed junk. I GOT IT!! you're name from now on until your death a million years from now will be...Marshmallow!"

Oscar couldn't believe what he just heard and neither could the rest of his children. Half them laughed while the other half remained silent. 

"SHUT YOUR DAMN MOUTHS!" Menja shouted at HER children, the volume of her voice shook the walls of the palace. Although she was only three feet tall, when she got angry, it was beyond belief how much power and authority she displayed just using her voice. 

Marshmallow lowered his head in reverence and respect toward his mother and his father. He rose and straightened himself and returned back to stand beside his brothers and sisters. Menja took a moment to really inspect just how different each of their children looked and acted from one another. Some were anthropomorphic animals, others had skin as brilliant and as beautiful as sapphire. One child in particular got her attention after dismissing Marshmallow. He stood with a slouching posture. His skin was dark green. He had black markings across his body. But what really made him stand out was his over sized forehead. 

"Ooohhh," Menja cooed with excitement, "I love the look on this one. You there, come here and present yourself to your mother and father."

As he tried to kneel down on one knee to imitate what Marshmallow did, he almost fell over due to the great weight his large forehead placed on his neck and shoulders. Menja snickered and giggled. Oscar was not so thrilled about it, but in fact felt sympathy that one of his children, odd and terrifying as some of them appeared, was born the way he was. But his son did not look bothered nor showed a lack of confidence in how he looked or how he was born. He supported himself by placing both of his hands on the floor and kept himself from tipping over forward. 

"Okay, okay enough laughter." Because you have such a fat head, I will name you...The Brain!"

"The brain? I understand that he has a large forehead, but can't you give him a more dignified name?" Oscar told her. 

"Nope," Menja answered him "he's going to be known as The Brain. He can do things with that massive head of his that no other of our children will be able to do. You are dismissed. Now Oscar, it's your turn to name one of your children."

Oscar looked around and wondered who from the group to choose first. While most of his children looked humanoid or were anthropomorphic animals, there was one individual, a male, who without a shadow of a doubt was thee most human looking one out of all his kids. He was a six foot tall man with copper skin tone and black wavy hair. He appeared physically strong with tight muscles, prominent abs and pectoral muscles. The color of his eyes were black. He had this look of arrogance and confidence that he swore he could feel pressing down on him. He looked no older than 29. 

"You there, the man with black hair and eyes, come over to me."

The man stared at his father. He gave him this cocky yet cold and calculating look before casually stepping out of line to approach his father. But unlike his previous two siblings, he did not kneel before Oscar or Menja, something his tiny mother did not take too kindly. Raising her left hand over her head ever so casually. She formed a tight fist and lowered her hand in a swift motion. 

Their son was forced down to his hands and knees by an unseen but extremely powerful force, that no doubt originated from Menja. He fought the pain of this immensely oppressive force placed on him by his mother and lowered his eyes and head in a submissive manner. When she saw that her son was willing to comply, she removed the power and authority she had over him. 

"You are the most human looking out of all my children. To be honest, I don't care that all of you are half human-demons. I'm just happy to finally have children. I'm happy to have new faces to see everyday, new voices to hear-"

"Hey! What about me Oscar? Are you getting bored of me-" Menja interjected angrily.

"I just want all of you, my children, to show your mother and me the same level of respect that you want shown to you." Oscar finished saying, ignoring his wife's comment.

"--Hey! I wasn't finished talking, that's great advice by the way. But I'm still pretty mad." Menja said, finishing her short rant. 

"Very well father, mother. If respect is what you want, then respect is what you will get from me. What will my name be from henceforth?" he said, speaking softly. 

"Your name from this forward will be...Eduardo."

"Ed...Eduardo..." he said softly, taking in and sounding out his eternal name that would be his from this henceforth. 

"You may rejoin your brothers and sisters, Eduardo." Oscar told his son.

Eduardo bowed his head, giving him mother and father a cold stare accompanied with a deceitful smile and rejoined his siblings.

"Magic to my race, my species, is like technology to yours. Unlike your people who work with machines to help you with your lives, we never has the skilled and talented people who invented machines to help us with our daily lives, although when I think about it now, machines would have helped up greatly. I want to teach you some basic offensive and defensive spells, they won't be as powerful as the magic I used to kill that chimera. But they will be enough for self defense."

"I'm willing to learn anything so long as it means we can survive and our bloodline continues. So how is it done?" 

"Its more than just chanting some words. It involves feeling the energy in the ground, in the water and especially in the air. But the most abundant source of energy comes from the heat and light of the sun. you and I can both feel the heat of the sun on our skins. We feel the air through our hair and we can feel the ground on our feet and feel the coolness of water. Take that sensation and concentrate it in your most dominant part of your body. Tell me dear, where do you feel your most dominant part is on your body?"

"Well I used my arms a lot when I was a coast guard."

"That's great. Now try not to feel just with your senses, but with your being. I know this sounds strange, but you will get the hang of it. With no more of your world's religions to inhibit magic's natural state in all worlds, including yours, it's sure to come back stronger everyday. Would you like a demonstration?" 

"Please" Benjamin answered, excitement in his voice. 

Thyia muttered something her native elven language, whilst turning her stretched finger around in a clockwise motion. A small tornado formed below the area where she spun her finger. It grew bigger and stronger in power until it stood three feet tall. Benjamin marveled at how effortlessly his partner made magic seem. He would spend all night trying to harness the ancient power of magic. Little by little,

Standing with feet shoulder width, knees slightly bent. Miyuki sat between his feet, her head thrown back. She kept one hand around his waist, and the other wrapped around the shaft of his cock. Brandon let out deep satisfied moans as his wife licked and slobbered over his balls while stroking his rigid member. 

"Ungh, fuck! Hahh, Ughh" he moaned passionately. 

"Mmmgh, Ngghh, Hahhn, Hahh." 

"Of my God, Miyuki...fuck I can't take this anymore!" Brandon gasped out. 

Miyuki licked and gobbled his scrotum in her cool mouth frantically. The warmth of the thin skin separating his delicate testicles and her lukewarm tongue, drove her wild. The feel of his soft yet warm balls swirling between her eager tongue drove her husband wild. He felt like he could cum at any moment. Before he could finished early, he pulled face away from underneath his crotch and threw her naked pale self on top of their marriage bed. 

She laughed and giggled at his determination and sexual excitement. She propped herself up on her elbows, showing off her large breasts. Her pale pink nipples were erect in excitement, her silver hair was splayed out all over the bed beneath and behind her. She crossed and uncrossed her legs, showing glimpses of her pussy covered in light silver fuzz for him. Stretching his arms and rotating his shoulders in anticipation for making love to his wife. Getting on top of his bed, he gently grabbed her knees and slowly parted them. His hard cock throbbed between her pale thighs. Her sparkling blue eyes focused in on his manhood like a laser. Laying on top of her, his chest and her chest pressed against each other. Her entire body at its highest temperature felt Luke warm, like coffee that was neither hot nor cold. 

Positioning the head of his cock at her entrance, and with a slightly hard push, Brandon and Miyuki consummated their marriage. The initial thrust was delicate at first, but at his ice wife's urging, he increased the pace of his thrust, burying himself as deeply as he could. A cute and soft gasp escaped her lips each time his warm cock slid in and out of her. The pleasant sensation and feeling of his rigid throbbing cock spreading her walls apart and pressing against her deepest parts, pushed her over the edge. The muscles of her vagina were tight and vibrating excitedly with an abundance of life. 

"Yes Brandon, hhnnggn, put your child...inside of me!" 

Brandon slapped his groin even more intensely against her crotch, eager to give her and himself what he wanted. 

[Back in Mexico]

"Eduardo, Marshmallow, Strawberry, Mouse Man, The Brain, Sapphire, Gato, Horse Head, Rebecca, Esmeralda, and Coffee. Are these really the names of our first twelve children, Menja? Are you happy with them? I hope their not going to continue to roam around naked."

"Nyahahaha. Twelve beautiful children, Oscar. I will forgive you this one time, but when spirits are given names by their creator, it is more than just a name that is used to address them. The name becomes like a second life for them, like another skin that fuses with their being. Calling them by their name grants you access to them. It gives you power over them, especially if you are their creator, it gives you total control over them. There is power, like there is fear and control in a name my big dick husband. Now, it's time to summon them all here to the main office."
