 Author's notes: 

VE: Todger65. Much love! You give the magic form and the dreams substance.

 Thank you dear readers for reading! It's why I bother to transform electrons to words instead of keeping them in my synapses to be lost.

 Yes this is a cluster fuck of incomprehensibility. Yes it's all based on stuff I've been working through my brain for years now. Yes, it will make more sense, but it might not for quite some time. Yes, I'm an asshole for not posting this chapter sooner. This book is at about the half-way point, but who knows, maybe I'll drag it out a bit longer. Once it wraps up, we'll move on to another group of characters that will be interacting with these ones, sort of like how the Avenger movies work.

 Now, once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more!
