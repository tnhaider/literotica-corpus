 Of the words spoken in verse by the shrewish woman in this part of the story; these words hold a mystery at the heart of this story, there meaning is revealed by the end. 

Any criticism is very welcome as I am relatively new to writing, this being the second story I've written.

I hope you enjoy.

Thanks,

Guthredd Sleeve-heart's tale (or The Circle of Three Hearts): Part 1

There was a man called Antler, the son of Eyvind and of Hallbera. Antler was honest and meek, hard working and loyal to his friends. 

He settled a farmstead with stone and turf on the middle islet of the Sound and yielded many successful crops. Antler ploughed the home-field for crops and tended livestock on the heath. One autumn Antler was working the haystacks and would often see the daughter of the farmer next door hanging out the washing by the log outhouse.

The neighbouring farmer was called Sigurd and his daughter was called Thorarna and as Antler tended to the sheep or worked the home field in the morning dew he would say to himself;

"She is the most beautiful of women and a great lady." 

It soon became Antler's favourite past time to rest his peepers on the sight of Thorarna hanging out the washing surrounded by the barren scrubland and singing linnets. 

Antler thought he had seen nothing more beautiful than Thorarna's graceful silhouette against the red autumn sky as she tied her long hair back.

He would rise early from his bed-closet, don his work tunic and boots and be in the home field each morning where his peepers could best rest upon the beautiful Thorarna.

Each morning Antler was amazed to discover a new aspect of Thorarna's beauty: One day; the curve of her ear, another; the wisps of delicate hairs at the nape of her neck, again another day; the way she seemed to smile upon all things. 

Mingled amidst Antler's view of Thorarna's beauty were moments of stolen intimacy: The white flesh of the side of a breast, exposed for a spell from out the side of her grey woollen tunic where it flapped open at the sides, tied only at the middle with twine. Or glimpse of naked thigh when the wind took the hem of Thorarna's tunic.

Sitting by the hearth each evening Antler would treasure his horde of memories of Thorarna and it was a great joy to Antler to ponder the softness of her breast suddenly exposed to a chill autumn wind or the secret of her left nipple made visible to the whole brackish moor-land for just a moment. 

He wandered if the thrush, the pheasant or perhaps the vole were as enchanted by Thorarna's beauty as he.

By Winter's Eve Antler had caught the eagers for Thorarna and dearly set his heart upon her.

At the Winter's Eve feast, amid much drinking, Antler asked his host for his daughter in marriage. Sigrid saw that Antler was hardworking and loyal and agreed the bride-price and dowry.

Antler paid the bride-price with a hundred of silver and two milking cows.

The dowry was set at twenty four ells of homespun.

The wedding of Antler and Thorarna was held the following spring and people said that never had there been a more beautiful bride married on the middle islet of the Sound.

At the leaving of the feast there was a great giving of gifts but Thorarna prised amongst all the gifts the golden arm band from her father, Sigrid. 

Antler and Thorarna lived happily at the farm, working the home field for crops and putting the livestock to graze on the heath. It was said that Antler took good care of his household and Thorarna of the housekeeping, and although they had little they were content.

For the turn of three full seasons Antler and Thorarna shared the sunrises and the sunsets, the dew upon the heath and the nest eggs in the spring and throughout those three years Antler saw these things were but made to frame Thorarna's beauty.
