 This story uses the Saiyan race of DBZ fame, but does not use any of its main characters or plot lines. Hence, I am posting this chapter in SciFi rather than Celebrity. It can be called fan fiction. I hope you like it. Give me comments and feedback on your way out.

Measures of weight, time and length have been converted to human units. In case you haven't seen DBZ, Saiyans look like humans, but are infinitely more powerful.

DISCLAIMER- Note that the alien races shown here are barbaric and cruel. The things they are implied to have done have not been watered down. Not a fluffy read ahead, in case you expected that.
