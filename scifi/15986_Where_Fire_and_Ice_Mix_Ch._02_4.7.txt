 Author's note 1: I do not have an editor, and while I did go through and catch most spelling errors those I could not find the correct spelling for I marked with a **double asterisk**. Any others was missed or on purpose (As in an ascent).

 Author's note 2: This is a first draft stile submission.

Note: I'd like to point out that the basic language used is Beasten that I've translated into English, including the accent used by the dwarf. Also some words will not translate directly or translates offensively; in this case the 'phrase will be marked in this way', without the underlining that marks this segment.
