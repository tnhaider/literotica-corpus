 The sullen stranger opened his brown eyes to the warm dawn and marked the start of his fifth day in a mobile cage. He brushed a lock of his shaggy brown hair out of his eyes and looked around. It was bad enough that he woke up on a bed of hay that reeked of animal droppings, but the scent was made worse by the rain that fell and blew through the bars of their open-sided cages. My jeans are junk, he thought.

The same situation played itself out in all of the cages behind them in their prison caravan. He stank, the cage stank, they all stank, and the rain only mixed the odors into a wonderfully putrid concoction that threatened to overcome their senses. The stranger almost growled in anger when further insult was added and he was forced to sleep on cold, wet hay, but the presence of the armored riders that flanked each wagon held him in check. The lump on the back of his head still hurt from when he had tried to speak when he awoke on the first day. He had tried to ask one of the prisoners, one who looked to be a bald, wrinkled gnome in rags who wore glasses that enlarged his eyes to comic proportions, where he was. In the moment that followed, the stranger mistook the look of fear on the tiny humanoid's face to be directed at him. The stars that erupted in his vision when the butt of the soldier's sword connected with the back of his head disabused him of that notion in short order.
