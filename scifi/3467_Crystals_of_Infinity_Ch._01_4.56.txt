 All characters involved in sexual acts are above the age of 18. Though the events of the story take place far in the future, the story has been narrated in past-tense as the records of this story have been sent through a time machine to the present era (this is the author looking for an explanation just for the heck of it). Multiple allusions to mythological beings are made in the coming content and future chapters, and it may be convenient to have basic knowledge about the Greek, Roman, Japanese, Norse and Hindu gods and goddesses, as well as beings of different species such as elves, werebeasts, dragons, mermen, fairies and other such fantasy creatures.

Please don't hesitate to give me your feedback! I'm returning to story-writing after a long time, and I think my skills may have gotten rusty, so please bear with me. :)
