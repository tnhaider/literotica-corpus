 Whistling, she made her way down to the yard. "HEY, YOU!" She jerked her head at Gerald. 

"Yeah, what now?" He snorted. 

"I have your order." She patted the wrapped box. "Want to give it a look and present it?"

Gerald rubbed his hands together. "Boy, do I."

She tugged the flap up. "What do you think?"

"Oh, man." He rubbed his hand on his mouth. "Is that really me?" He blinked and cocked his head to the side. "Is that really my ass?"

"You question my accuracy?" Her eyebrow shot up.

"Not a bit. I'm just in disbelief that my ass could look that hot."

"Smart answer."

A low wolf whistle had them both jolting. "Man, what a sight!"

Gerald put a hand on the man's face and shoved him back. "You only WISH you looked as sexy as I do!"

"That's YOU? As if!"

"Oh, shut it, Donald." Gerald closed the flap on the picture. "If you'll excuse me, I'm going to go get laid." He shot them a grin. "Probably twice."

"So, your best month yet?" Donald called.

Gerald shot his middle finger into the air. 

"Ah, brothers." Elunara snorted. 

Donald jerked his head. "How ya been?"

"Haven't seen you in awhile, doll." She wrapped an arm around his waist. 

"Just got back from Draenor a few days ago." He ran a finger down Lulu's cheek. "Why do you have another baby?"

"Long story short, she's Jordan's." She shrugged. 

Donald blinked. "Since when does Jordan get it up for anyone but you?"

"When I command him to." She winked.

"Makes sense." He considered. "You keep secrets..."

"Oh, no. What now?" She freed Lulu from the sling and sat her on the platform, tossing a couple of toys down. 

"I'm rather jealous of Gerald right now." 

She giggled. "Applying for my dating service?"

"You have a dating service too?" He shook his head. "Even with what I know, how the hell do you manage it all?"

"By being me, sugarcake. You want me to find you a chicky, you stop on by."  She sat down and popped out her board. 

"There's my little girl!" Jordan cried brightly, as he sat down at Elunara's side. When Lulu raised her arms, Jordan tugged her into his lap and gave her a cuddle. 

Elunara reached out and ran her fingers through his hair. 

"You know, I remember the first time I did this." He grinned at her. "I was just SO desperate to spend time with you."

She giggled. "And I was worried I was going to break your poor little heart." Leaning over, she kissed his temple. "Now look at us."

"Funny how that works."

"Hey, that's my line." With a wink, she went back to her work. "So, what happened to this paperwork?"

"I've gotten half of it done and turned in. Decided to take a little break. I'll get back to it after." He sighed. "Be quicker if I wasn't doing Grogek's paperwork on top of it."

"Yeah, but you two work best like that."

"I know." Jordan wrinkled his nose. "I need to get on him about filling in his assessments."

"Why don't you have him dictate, and you write? You know he has difficulty with those tiny forms."

"True." He snickered. "Those forms were not made for hands that large."

"It's a wonder he doesn't just use them to wipe his ass."

Both Jordan and Elunara jolted at Renwa's comment.

"Don't give him ideas." Elunara snorted.

Renwa eyed Jordan. "I am aware of one's desire to spend time with their wife and child, but I at least get my work turned in first."

Jordan flushed. "Yes, boss." He grumbled, before sitting Lulu back down on the platform. He shoved his hands in his pockets and walked away.

Renwa sighed. "Since you're best at it, why don't you get him doing his paperwork on time, so he won't back pile it and get MY wife on MY ass?"

Elunara giggled. "Zelinnia is a slave driver for her paperwork."

"Maybe I should threaten Jordan with her." 

"Might be more effective."

"Jordan has become entirely too lax since he took up with you."

"Most likely because he had nothing to do BUT work, before me." She shrugged. 

"Even if his change in work ethic is a result of him finally being happy..."

"It doesn't excuse the fact that he's changed his work ethic." She shrugged. "That, I understand completely. I'll work at him; see if I can get him back on track."

"That's all I ask."

Elunara giggled. "Zelinnia has a three year old and a near two year old, and she never got backlogged on her papers." She waved a hand. "But we know how obsessed that girl is."

"Obsessed with what?"

"Your paperwork." Elunara eyed the kids. "How are things?

Zelinnia sighed. "Some days it feels like this is getting easier, others harder. I'd have Nara down walking, but he's napping." She gestured to the child sleeping in the back sling.

"Come, sit down. Take a load off." 

"Ugh, maybe later. I've been sitting all day and now I need to walk." Zelinnia sighed and rubbed her back. "That hard surface is just going to suck."

"You could sit in my lap." She winked. 

Zelinnia went bright red. "Uh, maybe later. In private."

"Well, I'll come by and we can stick the babies together and I'll rub your back out."

"Oh, that sounds delightful."

Renwa considered. "On the one hand, if you would TELL me you need a back rub, I'd be glad to help. On the other hand, I do enjoy watching."

Elunara sang softly to Lulu as she made her way home. "That's my little sugar, go to sleep now. You'll have your nap, and when you wake up, I'll have plenty of fruit to con you into eating."

Without warning, arms came around her. With her burden, she didn't have time to react, and could only cling tighter to her precious bundle. The arms tightened around her middle and she gagged for air. "LET GO OF ME!" She growled. 

"Momma, I told you. Elunara does NOT like to be hugged by strangers."

"For what she did for my boy, she's family!"

"LET GO OF ME!" Elunara shoved at the woman clinging to her. "NOW!" She summoned her dagger. "Before I cut you off." 

"Momma, please. She's turning purple." Jerry sighed.

"Er." Louis added.

The woman released her grip, and Elunara stumbled, releasing her dagger to maintain her hold on Lulu. Jerry and Louis pushed her back to standing. 

"I am SO sorry, please don't kill me." Jerry whimpered. 

"Who the HELL is this maniac?"

"Elunara, this is my mother. Kaileen."

Elunara growled. "If I had dropped my child because of your stupidity, your life would be forfeit." 

"Oh, I'm so sorry!" The woman put her hands to her chest. "I didn't see the baby."

"Elunara can take a bit to warm up to..." Jerry gave a nervous laugh.

"But, this is the woman who did all those things for you." The woman blinked back and forth. 

"Yeah, but Elunara has a nasty temper when you piss her off."

Lulu began to fuss, and Elunara turned her attention to the baby. "Oh, my dear girl. Momma's alright. She's just angry." She glared at Kaileen. "VERY angry."

Jerry clasped his hands together. "Please don't stay mad at my momma."

"Well, I see where you get the hugging." She snorted. "I need to get Lulu down for her nap, so... follow or whatever."

Jerry let out a breath. "We're also lucky Elunara doesn't stay mad long."

Elunara began to sing again. Soon, Lydia appeared and began to sing with her. Bryan stepped forward and started to sing as well. Together, the three of them walked to Elunara's, singing in harmony. At the door, Elunara pat the heads of the kids, before tucking inside. 

"Oh, that was beautiful!" Kaileen gasped. 

"Yeah, Elunara and the kids like to do shows down at the amphitheater." Jerry sighed. "We told you about her fixing Bryan's mouth." 

Bryan leaned against the house, and sighed. 

"Unfortunately, Bryan now has a massive crush on her. Lydia, the girl, used to have bad legs. Elunara fixed those as well."

"Such a beautiful person." Kaileen dabbed at her eyes.

"She was a top of the top mission specialist, who would slit your throat and forget you existed."

"She's vicious mean when you piss her off." Louis blushed. 

"And yet, she's brought you two so much happiness." She sniffled.

"Alright, now that my child is safely in her bed..." Elunara sighed. 

"I am so sorry; I didn't realize you were carrying a child. It's just... my boy has told me SO much about you, I've been dying to meet you."

Rolling her eyes, Elunara leaned on the banister. "Then they should have told you that surprising me like that is a stupid idea." She eyed Jerry. "Granted, he and his husband plow me over at any given opportunity." Tapping her fingers, she sighed. "And not in the FUN way."

"Sorry, Elunara." Louis shuffled his feet. 

"If you don't stop blundering around like a baby cow, I'mma beat your ass." She scoffed. "Also not in the fun way, that's Jerry's job."

Louis went beet red. 

"Blunt, isn't she?" Kaileen giggled.

"Elunara doesn't do "modest"." Jerry shrugged. "Anyway, I wanted you to meet my momma, cause... uh... well..." Jerry's complexion matched Louis'.

"Because I'm your surrogate momma. Yeah, I get it." 

Bryan blinked up at her. "What...?"

Elunara grinned at Bryan. "They're like my adult kids."

"Does that make you my grandmother?"

"Not so..." She blinked. "Mother?"

Jerry grinned. "Bryan let us adopt him."

"Awesome. Anyhow, you can call me whatever. Everyone else in this blasted city does." She snorted. 

"How did you know?" Louis flushed.

"Pfft, when JORDAN figures it out, there's no room for argument." 

"How long have you known?" Jerry blinked. 

"Since my liberation from Lorros' filthy hands." She rubbed her hand on her bangle. 

"Now I feel really silly."

Elunara shrugged. "At least we've cleared the air." She waved a hand. 

"I want to hug you again!" Kaileen wiped her eyes. 

"Do it and I will flatten you." Elunara pointed at the woman. 

Jordan jogged up. "Uh, why is there a crowd this time?"

"Jerry's real momma."

Jordan laughed. "Well then."

"Shouldn't you be pushing paper?"

"I left some of it here." Jordan kissed her, before jogging in the house. 

"This time?" Kaileen blinked. 

"Oh, it's always some damned thing after another." Elunara snorted. 

"Momma!" Darguni waved an arm. 

"What now, you maniacs?"

Both boys stopped at the porch and huffed. 

"Hi, Lydia." Bradly gave her a shy smile. 

"Momma, a girl named Gingy was in the trade district saying, very loudly, that you stole Lulu." Darguni growled.

Elunara narrowed her eyes. "Well, I know where she got THAT bullshit from." She turned back to Lydia. "Does Gingy's mom hang out with a bitch named Cheryl?"

"Yes Ma'am. Gingy's mom was VERY upset when Cheryl went out to Draenor with her husband."

"Fucking figures." She dug her fingernails into the banister. "I'll deal with that little bitch later. You argued, correct?"

"Of course, Momma." 

"Good boys. This is no surprise to me; go back to what you were doing."

"Alright, Momma."

"Will you join us, Lydia?" Bradly held out a hand. 

Lydia sighed. "Well, someone should knock Gingy down a peg." She marched off the porch, ignoring Bradly's hand.

He shrugged and followed after her.

Bryan sighed. "No one gets by with that!" He chased after the other children. 

Kaileen blinked. "Well, then."

"Unfortunately, Lulu's birth has... questionable origins. Many refuse to believe that Jordan could..."

"That I could what?"

"Bitches decrying poor Lulu again."

He groaned and buried his face in her shoulder. 

She rubbed her hand on his back. "It'll die eventually."

"Not soon enough." He frowned. "I accept her as my baby, why can't anyone else?"

"Fuck if I know." 

"Is... she?" Kaileen hazarded.

"Yes, she is his. She is not mine by birth. People ironically refuse to believe that Jordan could cheat on me, and since I can no longer give birth, believe that I had to have stolen the child. Except for the whole part where, I never wanted a new one, and tore out my baby maker in order to avoid a second one."

Jordan winced. 

"Don't even get that train of thought started, Jordan. Circumstances are what they are, and I have accepted them. At this point, you couldn't force me to give up MY baby."

He sighed. "I'd stay... and discuss this further..."

"But, Renwa is on your ass. I know. Go deal with it, Sugar." She kissed his cheek. 

He tugged her in for a brain searing kiss, before jogging his way down the path. 

"Oh, my." Kaileen pat her chest. "That was... something else."

"One of the things I didn't put in my letters..." Jerry blushed. 

"Is, Elunara is known as "the goddess of sex"." Louis matched his color.

Elunara shrugged. "That I am. How else would I have known to put Jerry and Louis together?" She winked. "Come in the house, I'm thirsty." She didn't wait to see if they followed. 

Later, Elunara lay face down on the couch, and that was how Grogek found her. 

"Are you ok, love?" He put a hand on her back. 

"Don't mind me." She mumbled. "My brain is overloaded."

"Can I ask how you overloaded?"

"Not energy overload... dealing with Jerry's smothering mother, overloaded."

"Ah."

"With as anti-gay as Louis' dad is, Jerry's mother is total pro-gay. Apparently, she suppressed her own urges in order to live a "normal" life."

"That's... fascinating."

"Apparently, that's partly why, the first time Jerry came to me, he wanted the full treatment. He was following in his mother's footsteps, thinking he could never be what he wanted to be." 

"I... wasn't aware that ran in families?"

"It doesn't. That's the weird part." Elunara rolled over. "Apparently, after her kids were grown, she got a divorce. It was amicable enough, given the circumstances, but she hid it so well from Jerry, that HE didn't even know until she freaking FLOODED on me. GAH!" She buried her face in her hands. 

Grogek laughed. "People do like confessing to you."

"It. Got. Weirder!"

"Oh, no."

"Apparently, she wants to come back... by herself... for her own full treatment. And she TOLD me this, in FRONT of her lovely SON." Elunara raked her fingers through her hair. "THEN said that, Jerry's two mothers should be more acquainted!"

Grogek snorted, before erupting in laughter. "What?"

"What's so funny?" Jordan tossed some papers on the counter.

"Jerry's real mother thinks that she, and Jerry's adopted mother, should be fuck buddies." Elunara covered her face with her hands again. 

Jordan choked. "WHAT?"

"Gods save me!" Elunara groaned. "I'm not sure who was more shocked, me or Jerry." She sighed and scrubbed her hands across her face. "WHY IS THIS A THING?" She reached to the ceiling. 

"So, now I'm curious, love... did you agree?"

"YES!" She smacked herself in the forehead. "I was in too damned much shock to do anything else!"

Jordan was laughing so hard, he stopped making sounds. He coughed a couple of times, before managing to talk. "And you say I get in the weirdest situations??!"

"I seriously think we're in a frickin competition!" 

Tulani walked in and sighed. "Why is Elunara freaking out this time?"

"I'll repeat... Jerry's real mother thinks that she and Jerry's adopted mother should be fuck buddies." Elunara covered her face with her hands again. 

"Oh... oh, dear." Tulani put a hand to her mouth. "That's... fascinating."

"And I agreed!" 

Tulani broke into giggles. "Some small part of me wishes to see that." 

Grogek grinned. "Perhaps you could introduce the lady to Lucy."

Elunara's eyes went wide and she sat up. "That's a BRILLIANT idea!"

"What's a brilliant idea, Momma?" Darguni walked in. 

"One of my matchmaking schemes." 

"Oh." 

Grogek eyed Darguni. "Aren't you getting in a bit late for how EARLY you need to be up in the morning?"

Both Darguni and Bradly froze.

"I agree with him." Jordan eyed both boys. 

"Goodnight!" They both yelled, before running into their rooms. 

The men chuckled. 

"Alright, I'm exhausted." Elunara sighed. "I'm going to go crash on my face."

Tulani's eyebrows shot up. "No sexcapades?"

"Hey, both of these buggers stopped by today. I had my fucks, now I want sleep." She scrubbed her fingers through her hair. "Gods, I'm going to go bury my head under a pillow. Any of you lunatics gets an urge; just don't wake me while you get off."

Jordan blinked. "Now I know she's tired."

Grogek put his hands on his hips. "Perhaps someone switched wives on us?"

"Go fuck yourselves." Elunara flipped them off.

"Nope, that's her." Tulani giggled.
