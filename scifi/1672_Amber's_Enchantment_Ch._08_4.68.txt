 Chapter 8

The Death of a Slave

The pattern of fires on Destran's surface was being changed by the mysterious mana draining holes in the world. The normally random flames started appearing primarily near the holes themselves. What no one realized was that while the mana from Fron poured onto the planet evenly, the ability of the minerals, plants and animals to absorb that mana was dependant on the fires themselves. With the fires clustered around the mana draining holes, the substances and creatures able to absorb new mana had it stolen from them.

The sentient peoples of Destran had not yet put together that the holes were deliberate. The brisk trade that Melen Lustran had done had played into the shadows' hands. The transfer of massive amounts of copper from one dimension to another was having a predictable (if you had the right knowledge) result. Now that the flow of copper had been cut off, the invaders would take more direct action.
