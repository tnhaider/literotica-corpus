 Author's Notes:

This story is erotic fantasy, set in a world of magic. I reserve the right to be listed as the author of this work, wherever it is posted. If found posted anywhere except Literotica.com with this note attached, this story is posted without my permission. Â© Darkniciad 2000-2007

The sexual situations in this story will be far ranging, and may prove disturbing to some readers. Please be warned that the villains of the story are really evil, and the things they do are not glossed over, or toned down.

I make use of modern weights and measures quite often in my work, because those are the weights and measures of my fantasy world. I know many fantasy readers prefer more archaic terms, and I hope those readers can overlook my use of miles, feet, and other such measures.

You really need to read the previous parts of the story to know the characters and the storyline. This tale follows Danica in her day-to-day adventures, with the greater plot emerging slowly at first. Think of it more as a serial than a novel, and you'll be in the right mindset.

This is an edited version of this tale, making use of what I've learned since starting to post at Literotica, and the services of my tireless editor, Roust Writer.

Danica awoke and tried to get her senses to cooperate and function. Her first realization upon conquering the sleep fog was that she was lying in a cold, sticky wet spot -- a mixture of her juices and the enormous amounts of cum Nicholas had filled her full of before they fell asleep.

Nicholas was still sound asleep. Danica slipped out of the bed, and a thick stream of cum ran down her leg from inside her. She hurried to the chamber pot to avoid making a mess.

Danica silently cursed herself. She knew she should have gone straight to the chamber pot and the bath after having that much cum inside her. Lying asleep with it inside her had not been a good idea.

Danica emptied her bladder and took a long bath. She was glad to have the mess washed off her, but certainly didn't regret the pleasure that had caused it. Danica didn't think that even Zoraster's gangs in her first days at the complex had ever filled her with so much cum. The memory made Danica quiver.

Nicholas stirred as Danica blotted dry with a towel. The first thing he noticed was the same thing Danica had -- the mess he lay in.

Danica reached for her clothing. "Get in the tub -- you're a mess," Danica said with a smile.

Nicholas walked over and tried to wrap his arms around her. "Bath first," Danica argued and leaned in to give him a peck on the lips. "And no more fun today. The family will be up already. The last thing I want is to see them stare when we come out because they've heard me wailing like a banshee when you fill me to bursting."

Nicholas bathed and dressed, and only then did Danica give him a long, lingering kiss. They gathered up their things and walked toward the door of the tent.

Nicholas gestured back at the cum soaked bed and said, "Shouldn't we change the linens?"

Danica smiled and said, "Advantages of a magic tent. It will all be like brand new the next time I summon it. We could have shredded every linen in there and it would have all been in one piece the next time I summoned the tent. It takes a lot of damage to break its magic. A whole lot more than we could possibly do accidentally." She punctuated the last with a wink.

They left the tent and Danica returned the magic item to its traveling form. The couple then went up to the house and shared the noon meal with the family. After eating, they told the story of what had happened that night -- leaving out details best left unsaid, or covering them up with white lies.

The women provided Danica with an astounding variety of fruits and vegetables, as much as she thought she could keep fresh for any amount of time. They wanted to give her more, but Danica refused on the grounds it would go to waste.

When the family returned to their chores, a little later than usual, Nicholas said to Danica, "What now?"

"We'll just help the family with the chores today, have another good meal, and then another night together. After that, I'll have to return home. I've been away too long already," Danica answered and sighed.

"Danica, I..." Nicholas stammered.

Danica put her fingers to his lips. "No, don't go down that path. Tomorrow, you will get on your horse and ride home. You don't have to forget about me -- I'd be quite angry if you did, actually -- but don't dwell on me. It cannot be."

Nicholas nodded in understanding, though he let out a great sigh much the same as Danica's only a few moments earlier.

The two went to help the family with the chores. In the midst of feeding the chickens, Danica felt a sharp cold pain between her breasts -- Zoraster's amulet. In her mind, she heard his voice. Return, was all he said.

Danica bit her lip and sighed. The coldness faded away, though she could still feel it lingering. She went to find Nicholas, knowing they weren't even going to have that last night together.

The news devastated Nicholas, but he kissed her one last time and let her go when Danica explained her need to leave immediately. She stepped outside the barn and teleported back to her chambers at Zoraster's complex with a heavy heart.

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****}

Having received no instructions other than the order to return, Danica put away her produce and settled in to study, picking up where she had left off prior to the trip.

No one interrupted her, and Danica assumed that meant that she wouldn't be sent on a task -- at least immediately -- else someone would have visited or summoned her by now.

Still having received no instructions by that evening, Danica decided to go to bed. She bathed, and then pulled the last of a bottle of Boldheart Red from her cold box, replacing it with another from the wine cellar she had commissioned some months before. The cellar had required permission from Zoraster and a massive amount of restructuring of the nearby tunnels in the labyrinth beneath the complex. Many people had scowled at Danica in the halls for a while because of the disruption, and that Zoraster had approved it for her.

Danica settled in to her bed and poured the last of the wine in a glass. She sipped it and let her mind drift to her time with Nicholas. Her hand naturally found its way down to her panties to rub over them as she continued to drink and daydream. She thought the wine tasted a bit off, but decided she must have left it in the cold box uncorked for too long.

The glass dropped to the floor when she lost consciousness.

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****}

Danica awoke groggy and feeling strange. It took her nearly half an hour to summon up the strength and wit to rise from her bed. She sighed when she saw the bright red stain on the floor from the wine. Once she fully regained her wits, Danica examined the stain and determined that she would have to use her magic to remove it, because no normal means would take it out now that it had set for so long.

Danica went to her bath, and slowly started to feel better. As soon as she felt normal again, her mind drifted once more to Nicholas and her hand slipped down between her legs.

She stroked her folds, and then slid a finger inside her. She furrowed her brow when she felt strong resistance to her finger. She had exercised her vaginal muscles several times daily since her teen years, but the resistance she felt as she slid her finger inside her was something she hadn't felt since the first time she had reached orgasm this way as a girl.

She wiggled her finger, pressed harder, and eventually her wetness allowed her finger to slide freely in and out of her. She decided she was imagining things and her mind turned back toward Nicholas once more.

Danica came twice, then finished washing, climbed out of the bath to dress and return to her studies. She thought for a moment that it was odd that Zoraster had not summoned her or visited her after calling her back, but she shrugged off the feeling and returned to her books.

As evening approached, Danica sat down the old, worn text she was reading. The book was about Cantel Softspake, the grandfather of Darkniciad -- whom her sister and Zoraster had both studied under in the past. Cantel had gained vast magical power, and lived far beyond the span of normal mortal years. He had fathered Darkniciad's father, whose name the text did not mention, late in his long life. Danica smiled thinking that the man's virility indicated that his lifespan was not the only thing extended by his command over the Art. 

Cantel had fallen to the temptation of darkness, and forces in the world had turned against him. When at last he knew he must fall or face capture, Cantel had waited until the leaders of the assault against him entered his fortress and stood before him. Only then did the dark wizard raise his staff -- charged with an array of magical powers beyond comprehension -- and break it over his knee.

The resulting explosion of released magic annihilated Cantel and his enemies, vaporized his fortress, and blasted an enormous hole into the ground all the way to the strange network of caverns beneath the earth known as the Underworld. The site of the destruction was an ancient meteor crater, and the newer, deeper hole was now known as the Great Crater, one of the continent's most famous landmarks.

Danica cooked a roast, using the vegetables she had acquired during her last trip, and then sat back to relax with another glass of wine. She was pleased that the strange aftertaste of her last bottle was not present in this one. Sipping the wine, she acutely felt the needs of her body after a short time. She needed more than her fingers -- more than her toys -- and she hungered for the touch of another woman. Andrea immediately moved to the forefront of her mind.

Danica rose from her chair and immediately went to Andrea's room. The young woman was there, and delighted to see Danica. They talked of small things for a few minutes, but it didn't take long for their passions to overcome them. Andrea apparently hungered for the touch of a woman as much as Danica did.

Again, Danica noticed that odd teenage tightness in her as she and Andrea played. She thought Andrea even felt a little tighter as well. Danica just shrugged it off, as it wasn't causing her any real discomfort. She felt silly for complaining about something many women would wish for.

Danica returned to her room that night, and to her studies the next morning. She still received no summons to reveal the reason for Zoraster's order to return. Two days later, she felt the warming of her blood indicating that she had learned yet another powerful spell. The magic was known as Positive Forcebolt, a dangerous magical attack that drew on energy from the Positive Material Plane to attack creatures from the Negative Material Plane -- or creatures with links to that plane, such as the undead. She didn't know why her thoughts had turned to that particular line of study, but she was pleased with herself for mastering the powerful and dangerous magic.

She tracked down a new apprentice in the complex that night, feeling the need for a man inside her. He wasn't that big, but Danica thought he was going to split her in half at first. She quickly got over the uneasiness once she came hard, however.

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****}

The next afternoon, Zoraster finally sought her out. "I have work for you, my little rose," Zoraster said from the doorway of her lab where she worked on enchanting some magic items.

Danica turned and rose from her chair. Zoraster also turned and walked over to Danica's bed. The Archmage sat down on the edge of the bed and said, "You will be seeking a spell book. The information I have received says that this man possesses a book of rare ancient spells." Zoraster conjured up an image of a handsome, dark-haired man.

"More likely -- it is in the possession of the one he serves. The man is quite adept at charm magic, and has developed original spells that allow him to enact powerful charms with almost no gesture, triggered by a series of common words. I desire those spells as well, if at all possible. The man is adept in other forms of the Art, though his charm magic is the most dangerous. I chose you for your remarkable will for this mission, though I have already sent another to lay the groundwork. You will need to convince this man you are under his spell, because he will inevitably attempt to charm you. Then find that which I seek."

"I understand. When do I leave?"

"Immediately. Study this pattern and teleport to my outpost in the city. The servants there will direct you to the man's place of business and provide you with the other information you will need. Good day, little rose," Zoraster answered and took his leave.

Danica gathered up what magical and mundane things she thought she might need, and then sat down to study the pattern. When she had committed the pattern to memory, she summoned up her magic. Danica released the spell and teleported with the image in her mind.

Instantly, she appeared in the pattern room of one of Zoraster's near infinite and identical outposts scattered throughout the globe. She walked out into the bedroom that adjoined the room and pulled back the shades to try to ascertain her location.

What she saw told her little. She might be a few miles from Zoraster's complex, or on the other side of the world. The people moving around within her view told her no more than the flora and fauna.

Danica walked into the common room, where servants already awaited her. She knew that Zoraster would have alerted them to her imminent arrival, and that the announcement bell that chimed in the servants quarters when anyone teleported via the pattern would have revealed her arrival.

"I am instructed to give you this." A balding man awaiting Danica in the common room said. He continued, "May I be of any service to you?"

"Not at the moment. I need to read this and find out exactly why I'm here. If I need you, I'll ring the servant's bell," Danica answered as she broke the seal on the packet he handed her.

"Very good," the man responded with a bow before leaving the room for the servant's quarters.

Danica found a letter on top of the papers within the packet.
