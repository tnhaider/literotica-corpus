 ***** Lamentation's Course *****

Brandon sat in the backseat of the S.U.V., and caressed Sara's hair while mumbling to himself in soft tones. Mercedes watched the strange act through the rearview mirror as she drove down the highway, and was puzzled by the care the large man was showing the unconscious woman that rested in his lap. She could feel his elation as he studied his prize, and knew that for Brandon, this was the fulfillment of a fanatical desire. 

Every few miles she would chance a glance into the backseat, where she would take in the odd scene. Brandon noticed as they crossed into Oregon, and commented, "You really taught that whelp a lesson. Good job, killer."

Brandon had meant it as a term of endearment, but it only worked to confuse the poor woman, who was still tormented by what she had done. The joy and appreciation she felt from Brandon through their bond added to her confusion, and felt like a ray of light shining through the longest and darkest storm of her life. It became difficult for her to focus on the terrible things he had done to her as she felt his elation build within her; she had pleased her mate, and their magical connection rewarded her for her deeds — her terrible, despicable deeds. In so many ways, she lamented where she was, and realized how much better her life would have been if she had bonded with someone — with anyone — else.

Her hands trembled on the steering wheel, and when she closed her eyes, she saw Andrew's dead eyes looking back at her. A frightening image that followed her from the Olympic National Park, and reminded her of what she had been forced to do. Mercedes ran her hands over her jeans in an attempt to remove the phantom blood that she felt on her fingers. Despite having washed her hands in a stream when they had fled to their stolen vehicle, every time she studied her immaculate hands, they always felt dirty.

"There, there, sweet girl," Brandon cooed as he pet Sara's damp hair. The bruise he had given her was already fading, but his caress seemed to do little to calm the young woman, who tossed and turned in her sleep. "You're free from that awful wizard, kitty. Just relax and heal. Everything will be better now," he said, with a tender expression on his face.

The sound of rattling chains filled the cab of the vehicle as Sara bucked against some unseen force within her dream, before she whimpered, "Andrew, no," and continued to twist in Brandon's lap. 

Mercede's watched from the driver's seat, and was mesmerized by the compassion she could see in Brandon's eyes and feel through their bond — he seemed nothing like the monster she had come to know. 

She had not known Sara well — their time together in the clowder had been brief — but the fiery redhead had always been fun and compassionate, finding ways to take joy from most of the moments they shared. The worst thing that Mercedes could say about Sara, was that she had been unyielding. She was true to herself, and while she never expected anyone else to bend to her will, she often played in isolation, because the rest of the group would do something she found no interest in.

It was fair to say that Mercedes liked Sara, and wanted to save the younger woman from her fate. As the miles passed by, and Mercedes narrowed in on their destination, she wondered how long Brandon would try and force a bond on Sara, before realizing that he would never convince her to love him. Would it take hours, days, or maybe months? 

There were two things that Mercedes knew: Sara would never love Brandon, and Brandon would kill her the moment he realized that.

***** Divine Inspection *****

The Mother Superior stood at the edge of a white marble chamber, her white gossamer robe billowing out behind her with the force of the cool breeze that rushed in from the outside world. The translucent robe did nothing to hide her naked body, which was illuminated by the bright sun that flowed into the large open bed chamber. Though her silver-blue eyes stared off towards the massive clouds that roiled beneath her, it was clear that her focus was elsewhere, as her eyes failed to track the steady changes that were rippling across the watery mountains that shifted hundreds of feet below.

"What is it, my everything?" a deep and commanding voice asked as it approached her from behind.

She seemed small, almost insignificant, as she was enveloped in the shadow of the large man who stood behind her. The All Father knew better than to disrupt his matron when she was having a vision, so he idled the moments by with visions of her body.

Her skin was without blemish, and seemed to possess a golden iridescence that captured and transformed the light as it crossed her. Like the All Father, her wings were dispelled, hidden from sight, and waiting to be summoned. Her long golden-blonde hair was bound in an intricate network of interwoven braids that he admired for both, their beauty, and their practicality. The numerous and powerful wards that were formed by their exacting design was subtle, and would be missed by all but the most observant.

They had shared a long life together, and despite the familiarity that time brought, he found her just as captivating as when he had first met her. He kissed her shoulder, and as he savored the taste of ambrosia on his lips, he could sense her arousal at the contact. She remained motionless as she stared into the distance, her eyes following some far-off event. The All Father basked in the warmth of her body as he pulled her against him, and the two lovers seemed to glow within the light of the sun as they surveyed the clouds below them.

The scent of her arousal began to fill the air, and was carried on the breeze through the rest of their bed chamber. He admired the view of their cloudy paradise while he waited for the Mother Superior to return to her senses. After a few minutes of quiet contemplation she stirred in his arms, and a chuckle escaped her lips as she leaned back against his strong chest.

There was a deep sense of longing in her voice, as she said, "My mighty Lord, had I known you would be waiting, I would have returned with haste." She pressed her body against his hardened length, her thin, semi-transparent robe allowing her body to slide against him with ease.

"It is as it should be, my everything. What of the Magus?"

The Mother Superior turned in the All Father's arms, and he could see the conflict in her ageless eyes. "It has been an eventful night in the mortal realm. The Dire Wolf fought with guile, placing the Forest Guardian at the edge of death. Her salvation came at the Healer's hands, with tremendous support from the Magus. He was left weak, and as his mate ferried him to their sanctuary, they were ambushed by the stray and his captive. The stray's command compelled the captive to kill Andrew."

"What a tragedy," he said, taking his bride by surprise.

She looked up, her silver-blue gaze showing the uncertainty that raced through her mind. "Why does this boy trouble me so?"

The All Father looked into the Mother Superior's eyes, and was reminded of the frailty that lurked within the woman's distant past. "Andrew was unlike any Magus you have ever hunted, and where you expected to see darkness, he gave light."

He pulled her into his embrace, and tried to soothe the worry that his words had given her. After a moment he became aware of how discordant her emotions were, and realized there was a truth that she was hiding.

"You remain incapable of obscuring your emotions, my precious. You're not troubled by the loss of divinity he could have brought, but rather, you continue to anticipate the threat he may pose. What has happened?"

Wrapped against his powerful chest, she shook her head and marvelled at how observant he was, before taking a deep breath and speaking, "He is a clever boy, and while the captive believes she has killed him, he remains among the living."

The rumbling laugh that filled the All Father's chest brought a frustrated smile to the Mother Superior's face. She knew how he felt, and wished that he could share in her concern over the new Magus.

"I know you sense it as clearly as Caili does — he is a good man. Though you know as well as I that his nature demands power, and the natural order will pay the price for his greed."

They held each other, and thought back over the near-millenia that they had shared, having witnessed first hand the impact that an unchecked Magus could have.

Her voice trembled as she said, "His power continues to grow, and while we thought he was bound to the Fae, the Healer has proven that a lie."

The All Father felt her worry as if it were his own, and released a warm chuckle as he caressed her smooth back. "However he did it, our realm can only have a tempering effect on the young man. It's your nature, my lovely bride, to desire to end his threat, and see the mortal world safe. Some instincts are impossible to ignore, but you must not lose sight of the greater picture.

"Acheron stalks unseen, and sets his machinations in motion. The Council begs for your aid, and as the gates are crashing down, you idle your moments by watching a boy play wizard in the woods."

The Mother Superior squinted her eyes, feigning indignation at her husband's playful accusation. He leaned down and shared a sensual kiss with his matron, his body reacting to the bronzed flesh that pressed against him. 

"The shadows continue to grow, and whether Andrew will be consumed by the darkness or bask in the light remains undecided. Caili is among your strongest and most trustworthy champions. Leave the young Magus to her, and I will find many ways to take your mind from these troubling thoughts."

He gripped her ass, lifting her off of the cool marble floor and into his arms. Her thighs were wet from her arousal as she wrapped them around his waist. They both moaned as he spread her open, and as he sank into her — his ejaculate announcing his arrival — they quivered in the grips of their magical passions.

While the All Father mounted his bride, the vast and billowing clouds that swirled around their nest flashed, sending lightning dancing across their surface in the warm afternoon light.

***** Aftershock *****

The scent of the forest was the first thing that Tani'm noticed as the weight of her hibernation began to fade. Memories of the great wolf's attack flooded her, and for a moment she thought that she may have died from her wounds, until she heard the sound of an unfamiliar female voice.

"So a wolf did all of that?"

"A goddamn huge, fucking monster of a wolf," Carl responded to the unknown voice. Tani'm could tell that he was carrying her as they moved through the brush. "Shit, I think she's waking."

The forest floor had never felt so good, and as Tani'm's body made contact with the cool moss and rich soil, she could feel the strength returning to her muscles. Her eyes were slow to open, and the night forest seemed darker than she had ever seen it before. After blinking the exhaustion from her eyes, she was greeted by the sight of Carl, Thunderfoot, and a very attractive woman with long curly brown hair and bright-brown eyes.

"Oh, thank goodness, dear. I was beginning to think that spell of yours would never cease," the woman said with a genuine smile, and Tani'm could tell that she was working hard to hide her own fatigue. Tani'm was captivated by the woman's light-brown eyes, and was so distracted by the intensity of the stranger's gaze, that she failed to realize that she had planted her hands and pushed herself up into a sitting position — the significance of the act being lost on her.

The woman smiled as she studied Tani'm's body, and the small magical woman could tell that the unknown person was inspecting far more than she could see with her eyes. The beautiful woman's expression brightened even more as she chuckled and shook her head. "I'm so sorry, this must be terribly confusing for you. I'm Karen, and unless your wounds were more severe than I know, then you already know Carl, and Peter," she said as she flourished her hand towards the tall man and happy jackalope.

As Tani'm's eyes settled on Thunderfoot, the large rabbit began pounding an excited beat on the ground with his giant paw, and she was assaulted by a joyous feeling from the relieved creature. She scanned the forest, sensing that everything was quiet and that they were safe. Looking back towards the new woman, she was surprised by how familiar Karen seemed, and how much she trusted her. It was as if Tani'm had known that woman her entire life, and she was looking upon the face of a long lost friend.

The two women gripped hands, and it was not until Tani'm was on her feet that she realized exactly why that simple act should have caught her attention. One of her last memories before her gift had blanketed her in the comforting embrace of her slumber, was the great wolf tearing off her right hand. She held up her hand and admired how smooth her skin was; a lifetime of calluses and scars had been replaced by perfect reddish-brown flesh. The last trace of her injury was her pinky, which was missing from the first knuckle down.

"How?" her soft voice asked, as a cold chill ran through her body at the shock of what she was seeing. 

Karen grinned as she responded, "It wasn't easy. If not for that peculiar bandage, or your hibernation spell, I fear that your wounds would have claimed you..." She paused, placing her hand on Tani'm's arm, which drew the woman's attention to her, "There was some kind of hex or foul magic on your wounds, which made them very difficult to mend. While you rested, I healed what I could, and with the help of... well, the assistance of some good friends, I was able heal most of the damage."

Tani'm could see the weariness behind the kind woman's eyes, and realized just how much of a strain the healing had been. 

"Where are your friends?" she asked, as she scanned the forest.

Karen took a deep breath, and blinked back her exhaustion before responding, "They were forced to retire to a more... secure location, and recover," Karen concluded with a smile, pleased with the intrigued look the small woman was giving her.

Tani'm again studied her hand, and could feel her muscles regaining some of her lost strength.

Karen said with a heavy breath, "I should be able to restore your pinky and close up those last couple of puncture wounds on your leg once I regain some of my strength." Now that they had stopped, she was beginning to realize just how tired she had become.

"If you two are done playing catchup, can we get the fuck out of these woods?" Carl asked, with frustration resounding in his voice. His eyes still scanned the forest, and while the rabbit and Tani'm seemed at ease, he could not shake the feeling that the wolf was hiding just out of sight. The things that he had seen that night would haunt him for years to come; and what troubled him most, was that he knew he would never be able to explain the true source of his terror — because, who would believe him if he did?

Tani'm ran her fingers against the side of the jackalope's face, pleased to see her friend once more, and shared in the creature's relief at having survived the altercation with the great wolf.

As the small group made their way between the trees and towards the highway, Tani'm asked, "What of the beast, did you slay it?"

Carl released a sardonic chuckle before responding, "No, and I'm not sure that damned thing can be killed. I hit that fucker dead to rights with a .30-06 and it shrugged it off."

Karen felt a bit more optimistic, though she could understand the man's frustration. "I believe that the creature must have been using magic, which would explain how it could survive so much damage. When I was healing you, I think that the force which was working to prevent my healing was fueled by the beast, and if its magic is anything like mine, then it sacrificed a tremendous amount of energy to try and keep me from mending your wounds."

They had again stopped, and the highway was just visible through the brush as the group looked at each other. "If you want to kill this thing, you have to capitalize on this advantage. You cannot wait and let it regain its strength."

"You gotta be fucking kidding, right? You want us to go back out there?" Carl looked from Karen to Tani'm, and could see the resolve in her eyes. She was ready to vanish into the forest and hunt down the wolf in that moment, and she would, if not for the fatigue which was causing her extremities to tremble.

Tani'm took a deep breath, and then spoke, "Carl, I need you to go to Eddie and explain everything that happened. We need to get those men's bodies out of there. They were brave, and their sacrifice must be recognized by those of us who know what they have done." 

She paused, sparing a moment to appreciate the price they had paid, before continuing, "We need to get another hunting party together, and I want you to head it up. You understand what we face, and will appreciate the danger. Your skill and bravery is the reason I'm still alive, and I cannot imagine going after this beast without you at my back."

The stern-faced man nodded, admiration shining in his eyes as the two warriors shared a mutual respect.

"I will need a couple of days before I can go toe-to-toe with the great wolf again, so work with Eddie on a three-day timeline."

He popped a solute, before grinning and running towards the road. It was clear to him that he was no longer needed, and the opportunity to leave the forest was too enticing to pass up. His anxiety about facing the wolf again was lessened with his new role. One thing that his time in the military had given him was a clear-eyed determination to see a mission through, and with orders to carry out, he found it much easier to push down his own concerns in the interest of completing his assignment.

"About that recovery time," Karen began, "that safe place I mentioned before may be able to help speed things along."

"That would be-" Tani'm's statement was interrupted as Karen turned and sprinted off into the forest, picking up speed once she reached the road. Whatever fatigue had slowed the woman down was lifted, and if not for Tani'm's gift she would have struggled to maintain the beautiful woman's pace.

"Hang on, you two, I'm coming," Karen chanted under her breath, as she recklessly ran along the side of the highway. After fifteen seconds, just as Karen was hitting a steady stride, she collapsed to the concrete and screamed out, "Andrew, no!" and her shoulders began to shake with the force of her sobs.

Karen could feel the sharp pain of Andrew's wound, followed by the sensation of life seeping from his body through their bond. His sprite faded within her mind as she trembled against the cold asphalt. Tani'm came up beside her, kneeling and resting her hand on the slender woman's shoulder, and she could see the few spots where her tears had already began to fall.

"What's happened?"

Karen struggled to focus on what had been asked through the flood of despair that built with every passing second as Andrew grew weaker and weaker, until after five seconds, his sprite was barely visible within her mind. As she choked back her fear, she could tell that he was no longer fading, and that whatever had been siphoning the life from him had stopped, though his wounds were still threatening to take him from her.

"We have to go, now!"

Tani'm looked into the resolved eyes of the strange and elegant woman, and while she knew that there were hundreds of questions she should ask, she felt them all fall away. What she saw in Karen's light-brown eyes was a person who possessed gifts as special as hers, and who for the first time, might be able to understand her.

Something about Karen spoke to her in a fundamental way, reminding her of feelings she had not experienced since she was a child first coming into her power. With unfaltering resolve Tani'm helped Karen off of the road, and together, the two women ran as fast as their weak limbs could manage, the trying night having taken its toll on both women.
