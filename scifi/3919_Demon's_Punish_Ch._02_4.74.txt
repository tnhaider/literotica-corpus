Warning: I encourage you to stop with Ch. 01, if you are looking for a story where everything always goes well for the protagonist. It stands on its own and ends more-or-less on a happy note. I hate stories where nothing is ever lost, where heroes slice through their enemies with nothing but a few scratches. Thus, I am more of a fan of Game of Thrones than I am of Wheel of Time. I want to set expectations now, so you don't waste your time if this isn't what you are looking for.

For those still with me, we got 5 more parts if things shake out how I expect them to. Then again, this chapter was supposed to cover 2 big events...and it only ended up covering 1. This book sits towards the beginning of a much larger story, some of which I've already written, involving a vast milieu and host of characters. I find myself writing further upstream, but I think I've found the source of the story. I wrote this one in about 10 days, and then spent a week on editing. I would say 1 chapter a month is what you should expect until the story is done. That's my commitment to who joins me on this journey.

Now, once more unto the breach, dear friends!
