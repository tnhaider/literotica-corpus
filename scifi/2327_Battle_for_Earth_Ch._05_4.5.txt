 Day 10

10, October 2218

**Paris, France**

Western Europe, Region 10

Unlike the previous three inter-species couples that passed before them. Roxane and Elred waited for someone to respond to their introductory video about themselves. They viewed Brandon and Miyuki's video and watched Eposi and Methild's video one after the other. The sun elf had more than a few judgments when he learned from the second video, about the presence of a male drow in this world. 

"Dark elves like that male drow, Roxane, are evil" he started to share, "Their raiders of villages and towns and take as slaves the people whom they have conquered. They are as black as the hearts that pump blood through their bodies."

His view on the other inter-species couple, Oscar and Menja was different than the one he held about Methild and Eposi.

"At first I thought that tiny woman laying on top of that man, was an average goblin. But a few things gave away her true nature. I have come across this species only once in my world during a long travel with some of my companions. Thankfully we never had to confront it. We spotted it coming out of a cave filled with a terrible amount of smoke billowing out from it. We considered this cave, in my world, as one of many entrances to the Hell realm. It was a demon, no doubt."

That was all some hours ago. Right now Roxane continued to stand by for a response to come in. Inside of one of the many kitchens of Elysee Palace. Elred was making breakfast for both of them. The sun elf was still wearing the same clothes he had on when he first met her. That was ten days ago! He was beginning to exude a strong fragrant mix of roses and honey, which was horrible body odor for sun elves such as him. At first she didn't mind that he smelled so good. But after a day, it began to permeate through every room he walked in and stuck to the walls and doors and floors. She forced him to take a shower and even stayed in the bathroom to make sure he did, albeit on the other side of the shower curtain. 

After taking a shower and now smelling of tree pines, a masculine odor for sun elves. Roxane left for him in his bedroom, normal human male clothes for him to wear. Normal clothes being a white shirt with the images of bunnies and the text underneath it reading, 'J'aime Les lapins'. Regular fit jeans and tennis shoes with socks. When Elred saw the choice of shirt she picked out of him. He had less than a few great choice of words for her.

"Sun elves such as myself will never wear such shameful torso coverings with words such as 'love' and 'bunnies' on them. I am a sun elf male, a high elf male, not a common elf! I must wear clothes properly suited for a race of royalty. You will put up with my next garden field smell until I am given a proper change of clothes." 

He went on continuing to wear the same old clothes he had on his back. Rather than putting up with another day of the halls and rooms smelling oppressively feminine. Roxane begrudgingly agreed to clean his original clothes, only if he would start wearing the clothes she picked out for him. 

The bedroom plan was clear to both of them from the start. No sex until Roxane is ready to have children. And there will be no sex without marriage first. Until marriage, they slept in different bedrooms.

Elred made toasted blueberry waffles that were soaked with syrup. Inside the French prime minster's office, Roxane was sitting at the desk staring at her LB phone. She waited for a response to their video that could come at any time which made her all the more anxious. In the mean time, her high elven partner came walking inside of the office holding their plates of toasted waffles soaked with syrup. He smiled as best he could and placed her plate down in front of her. She beamed delightfully at the waffles lying on her plate, their sogginess appearing cute to her, since they were made by his hands. 

She looked up and smiled gleefully at him. He stared back with his usual set of stern eyes. The smile he came inside the office with, had quickly vanished. When he tried to form a smile again, he failed miserably. He rarely the used muscles in his face to smile. So he tried turning around to walk out of there while he still had most of his dignity intact. Walking out of the office was not an option, as Roxane grabbed him by his wrist and pulled him back towards her.

"What's the matter Roxane, are you not satisfied by how I made your waffles?"

"No, I like it. It's a little overheated and its soaked with syrup. But I can't help but feel happy that you made them for me."

"Why are you happy? Someone has to prepare the early morning food" he said.

"Because you made it you big silly golden goose."

"I'm not a goose, but I am golden. Now let me g--"

"Come here and give me a kiss, Elred" she told him, puckering her lips and closing her eyes.

"Uuhh maybe later when your not busy."

"C'mon kiss me, don't be shy...c'mon."

"Uum, Roxane in all serious--"

"KISS ME!!"

"But we aren't wed yet, I can't just kiss you like we are. It wouldn't feel right."

Regardless of what he tried to say or how he said it. Roxane kept her eyes closed and her lips puckered. Actions that only further flustered him. She tugged on his wrist, pulling him closer to her, and he stepped back. She opened her eyes and gave him a serious look.

"We may not be married yet, but you can still show me you love me. You can start by kissing me or hugging me or doing both at the same time. C'mon."

"W-Womanâ€” I mean Roxane! Halt what your doing for a moment! You're going to make me drop my plate if you keep tugging on my arm like that!"

"Then just place it down and give me a kiss, what's so hard about that. Press your lips on mine. Then push your tongue in between my two lips and let our tongues dance and fight with one another. Doesn't that sound fun and exciting?" 

"Yes it does, but you are not my woman yet! Until the day you are, we can do as much base things as you'd like."

Finally relenting, Roxane let him go. "Fine, have it your way, you big baby."

"What did you just call me?" Elred said, surprised.

Elred's cheeks went red with embarrassment by how casually she called him a baby. His plate shook in his hand from anger. How dare she treat him like he was still some sort of a child. Roxane cut her waffles in chew-able bite-sized pieces with a butter knife and fork he brought with her plate. The blonde embarrassed angry high elf couldn't bear for the only woman he will ever know, to get away with calling him a big baby. He placed his plate down on the table with a hard motion, then moved in closer and turned her back over to him on her seat. This caused her to drop her utensils midway into eating. In a moment's notice, the blonde beautiful but hard-shelled sun elf pressed a rigid kiss on her lips.

Much to his surprise, and to her delight. She wanted more and jumped him. She forced him to hold her up by her hamstrings as she pressed her lips on his. She tried to force her tongue through his tightly sealed lips. 

"Stop it!" he cried out like a little child, turning his head from left to right trying to keep her from French kissing the hell out of him. As they played around in the moment, there was a *DING* sound effect that came from her phone. 

She dropped back down on her feet and reached for her phone on the desk. She grabbed it and turned it on. 

"Look Elred, Oscar's contacting us! It's the Mexican marine from the third video that came out!" she said with excitement.

"Thank the mother, I thought I was going to have to force you off me. If you need me I'll be outside in the garden shooting arrows at trees and flying birds. I might even fire at some passing squirrels."

"Hold on a second! Don't you want to be a part of this live feed introduction with me?" she asked him.

"Some other time." Elred walked out of the office with his plate of waffles in hand.

Roxane took her seat back at her desk. Fixed herself up and pushed her breakfast plate aside. She didn't want it to be in view during the live feed exchange with Oscar. She connected with him who was sitting at a polished redwood desk. The seat he was sitting on had a golden circular seal of the former federal government of Mexico. He was flanked by two large shimmering Mexican flags made of high-end reflective silk.

"Hello, can you hear me?" Oscar asked her, testing their connection status.

"Yes, hello, I can hear you just fine. Can you hear me too?"

"I can. I'm sorry It took me a while to contact you, but I was holding out on the right day to contact you. I didn't know if you were receiving many invitations or not. I wanted to hold out till everyone talking to you had their turn. My name is Oscar Mariano, lord of my region, Middle America. Don't take this the wrong way, but I think you're very beautiful" he complimented her.

Roxane blushed and smiled back at him. "Thank you, Oscar. You don't look half-bad yourself." Roxane replied. But as she did, she heard deep growling noises like those of a lion, coming from somewhere in his live feed. 

"What's that sound Oscar?" 

"Oh, that's my--"

"I'M HIS FUTURE WIFE! Did you just blush and smile at him you bitch?!" Menja screamed at the holo-screen, bearing her fangs and growling like an angry little dog.

"Aaahh!" Roxane screamed in terror, lurching back on her seat. 

Heavy footsteps from outside the long hallway, came like a rushing river. Elred kicked open the office door with a bow and arrow pointed at different areas of the room; Ready to protect her.

"What is it Roxane!? Where's the threat!" Elred shouted at her.

He looked around the office to find out who or what it was that was threatening Roxane. He found no one inside of the room, except for her. She was hugging her knees closely to her chest on her seat while staring back at the holo-screen in front of her. Elred placed his bow beside the desk. Placed his arrow back inside of his quiver hanging from his side. And stared back at Menja, the infernal imp who kept growling back at his partner. 

"Begone tiny demon! Terrorize my womanâ€”partner no more!" he commanded her. His irises shimmered with anger and his hands became engulfed in magical fire that produced no heat. But it did produce an unbearable amount of energy in the office akin to feeling more gravity.

"Hey Oscar look, look! This humanoid is a sun elf or a 'high elf' as they refer to themselves in their world. He thinks he can intimidate me, nyahahaha. I got news for you Blondie! I am the epitome of fire, and your magic is hardly enough to hurt me. Let alone put a scratch on my skin."

"Menja stop it!" Oscar yelled at his diminutive partner.

"Why?" she replied.

"This isn't how I want to establish relationships with other humans. Insulting their partners isn't going to help us," Oscar told her. "Please excuse my partner, she's got no filter on her mouth."

"Reign in your little imp bitch of a pet, human man. Or else I'll teleport to your location and tear her little still beating heart out of her chest, and eat it in front of you!" Elred threatened.

"Nyahahahaha. You sure are easy to provoke Blondie. Oscar did you know that elves, although not existing alongside humans. Are in fact the children of half angel-humans breeding with regular humans. Betcha you didn't know that. Betcha, betcha!"

"Menja that's nice to know, but I would really like to talk with Roxane in private."

"Oh no, no, no, no. The last time I left you alone to talk with another human, you were drooling over that American man's partner's huge knockers! I'm not going to be in front of the camera this time, but I'm not leaving the room either, so deal with it!" Menja said walking behind the camera. Her tiny footsteps captured on the phone's audio.

Roxane thanked Elred for coming to her defense, much to his silent embarrassment and appreciation. She pulled him in and placed a kiss on his cheek. Nodding his head at her, he turned and walked out of the office with his bow in hand. Leaving her to continue her diplomatic business. Menja sensed display of affection coming from the other couple. And rushed over to Oscar to counter it with their own.

"I heard a lip smack coming her end, that human woman kissed her elven partner. Come here Oscar, let me kiss your cheek too!" she said, standing on top of him.

"Menja no! Your kisses burn like hell on my skin! Noo!" he screamed as his diminutive partner's lips drew closer to his skin. Try as he might to keep her away from his face, he was no match for her inhuman strength. Even with the charm she gave him that granted him superhuman strength, it was nowhere near enough.

Roxane giggled and laughed at the other couple sharing a tender moment in front of her. Despite her fear of the tiny infernal imp. She became relaxed when she saw how casual their reaction was with one another at this point. 

**Australian Capital Territory (Australia)**

Australia/ Oceania, Region 26

Sleeping on a couch inside of the prime minister's office after doing not much of anything. Brandon tossed and turned, mumbling to himself about something incoherent. In his deep sleep, Brandon was dreaming a dream unlike any other he had ever had before. 

In his dream he rode around the garden of The Lodge on the back of a huge wombat. He was also In the company of his children, who wore kimonos and regular western clothing. They resembled him and his wife Miyuki. Some of the children had silver hair like their mother. Others had his dark blonde hair, and others had a mixture of silver and dark blonde hair. His children chased after him and the giant wombat he rode on. Only for his wife to join them who was also on top of her own giant wombat. They raced around the garden while their children ran after both of them.

"Miyuki this is so amazing! Where exactly did these giant wombats come from?" he asked her.

"I made them bigger with my powers. These are the children's pets, don't you remember taking them out to capture them?"

"No i don't remember. How strange that I can't remember anything. We should let the kids ride their pets now Miyuki." 

Back in the real world Brandon smiled and hugged himself. Thinking he was hugging his wife and children. Outside of The Lodge, Miyuki was creating a portal that was ten feet tall and ten feet wide with her snow and ice powers. The portal was in the shape of a tall arch with icy columns making up the body of the portal. In the center was a swirling pool of blue, white and silver colored energy swirling into the center. Each time she charged and released surges of her power. It created a loud bang sound effect with a humming sound that reverberated through the ground. It was like someone banging on something metallic and letting the piece of metal hum. The sounds were loud enough and strong enough to rock the ground. Including shaking Brandon out of his sleep. Shooting open his eyes, he straightened himself up on the couch and stretched his arms and legs. He went over to look outside of one of the windows in the office to see where the source of the noise was coming from. He saw flashes of white and blue light around the corner of the house and ran outside immediately to see what it was. 

Brandon saw his wife-to-be, Miyuki shooting blasts of energy from her hands into the portal. 

"Miyuki what is all of this?" he asked her.

"Ah, Brandon you're awake, good. I'm setting up portals to help you go where ever you wish in all Australia and Oceania. After all, this region is also your empire."

"Wow! Me, an emperor. Can you imagine it Miyuki..." Brandon's head took him into the clouds. He imagined ruling a region filled with his children. Including kangaroos, wallaby's, wombats and koalas.

"Our empire isn't going to be just us, our children and the native animals that live in it. When our sons and daughters have come of marriage age. We will invite the children of other ruling monarchs to settle down here. Where they will settle and start their own families."

"Soooo, sort of like medieval Europe then, right?"

"And like feudal Japan, my native homeland," Miyuki replied. 

"Hey Miyuki, you aren't planning on leaving me here all by myself, are you?" he asked, sounding worried.

She looked behind her back at Brandon, setting aside the power of ice and cold wrapped around her hands. She walked over to him, took his hands in hers and pulled him in for a kiss. Her lips felt lukewarm, but her tongue and the rest of the inside of her mouth was cool to the touch. Pulling away, she hugged him tightly. If it weren't for her large breasts pressing up against his chest, causing him to blush. Brandon's mind would have been more fixed on the love and affection he was receiving instead of on his penis. 

"I will never leave you alone Brandon, except only when I need to."

"Thank you Miyuki. And I will never leave you either, nor will I ever think it. To die alone in this new world, that's the last thing I want. I'd rather die with a hot snow-woman by my side, then with my hand down my pants one last time and staring up at the sky wondering if aliens are going to beam me up into one of their ships.. "

She giggled at his words, putting her hand up to her mouth. "Your funny Brandon. I'll be right back."

"What am I supposed to do while you're away, beautiful?" 

"You can decide what kind of leader you want to be. I know what kind of father you're already going to be for our children, so I'm not worried about that."

"Okay, I guess. But before you go, tell me exactly what these portals are going to be used for." He asked her.

"I'm creating these portals to allow you to travel to any of the four cardinal points in Australia. When I'm done here, I will move to Oceania and place a portal in the Marshall Islands. One on the island of Fiji. Another in New Zealand and the last one on Papua New Guinea. When our empire is alive and thriving, you will be able to visit any zone of your empire you'd like. These portals will only be available to you and me, and our children. This portal is finally finished charging. I'll see you soon Brandon." 

Miyuki walked through the portal and ended up in the city of Darwin. In the northern territory of the country. The city was like every other city and large town, abandoned. Except for the animals that now called the empty homes, businesses and parks home. She chose an abandoned park to start creating the northern portal. 

**Yaounde, Cameroon**

Central Africa, Region 18 

With dead bodies of buffaloes that were strung up on streetlights outside of the palace. Eposi continued to practice learning how to fight using two knives as if they were daggers. Eposi practiced the techniques Methild showed her during practice. She sliced deep cuts into the dead and swinging bodies of the wild dead bovines. Even though there was still Wi-Fi and internet. There was not much of anything else for the young Cameroonian woman to do to pass her time. She held out on bearing Methild's children for a later time. And instead honed some beneficial skills like self-defense and dual wielding. 

"This region of my world may be devoid of people. But I have this feeling somewhere in the pit of my stomach, that there's something hiding from me and Methild. I don't know how to explain it, but the silence has kind of made hearing the little changes in the air more easier." 

While Eposi continued to practice dual wielding on the hanging dead buffaloes. Not too far from the national palace, Methild was busy digging an underground lair. Being one drow male did not stop him from digging a mile long tunnel with nothing more than a pickaxe and a shovel. Being nocturnal and a natural underground dweller. Methild was made for long hours and even days of digging even if it meant doing it by himself. During digging, drows would have the company of giant-sized beetles to help them create new tunnels. Of course these were beetles enlarged by dark magic. Digging not only helped keep him busy, it also helped build and keep muscles and stamina. Another reason he was digging was he was also building his future children a nursery.
