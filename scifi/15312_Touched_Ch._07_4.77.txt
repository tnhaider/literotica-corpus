 "Grant!" I threw myself into his arms, just to make sure he was real. "Oh, what have they done to you?" I asked, reaching out to touch his battered face.

"I'm fine. What about you? Are you okay?" he whispered, his voice cracking as he squeezed me against his chest. 

"Yes, I'm fine," I told him, clinging to his shoulders, "but I've missed you so much. I was afraid I'd never see you again."

The stranger fidgeted, grimacing. "Get control of yourselves. Jebus ryste; what is it with you people?" she hissed through clenched teeth. "We're not out of this yet. Come on; this way."

"Why are you helping us?" Grant asked as the three of us scurried down the abandoned corridor.

"I don't have to explain myself to you."

"Well, whatever the reason, thank you for freeing us," he murmured.

Reaching the end of the hall, the woman stopped and looked in both directions, making sure the coast was clear. "Don't thank me yet," she said, spiriting us into a darkened room as the sound of footsteps approached from a neighboring corridor. 

After the footsteps receded, the woman turned and looked at us both, brow furrowed, her face tight with worry. "Look, deviants, I have no great love for your kind. Frankly, your primitive nature disgusts me. If you insist upon indulging your need for...tactile stimulation, do so someplace where I don't have to see it." She paused. "Someone I trust believes it's imperative you escape, that your freedom benefits a greater good. That's why, despite my personal misgivings, I'm helping you. Understand?"

We nodded, though her response raised more questions than answers.

"On the count of three, we need to exit the room. Run down the corridor and take the fourth door to your left. Got it?"

"Yes."

"Good. One, two,..."
