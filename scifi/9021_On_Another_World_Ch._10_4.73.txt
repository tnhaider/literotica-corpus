 Greetings readers! As you may (or may not) have known, my computer crashed...temporarily putting a halt to my writing. But, as you can see, I'm ba-a-ack! Okay, okay...I can't blame it all on the computer crash. There are other reasons as well. For example, in real life, I'm a single parent with a teen-aged son...need I say more?

All right folks, here it is! For those of y'all who wanted more actual sex...read on. Again, I am not knuckling under to those who complained about the lack of sex in this series...usually, I plan my sex scenes well in advance, but this one became unexpectedly necessary to the plot regarding Dee-Ess's relationships with his new wife and the two remaining slave-girls. It'll start with a brief, abbreviated 3 female/1 male orgy of sorts. And perhaps a wee bit more sprinkled throughout this chapter. Other than that, I will get back to the most important thing...the story. Don't get too used to it. We must all save Terrania from Kahn's evil clutches, am I right?

Some of you may remember that a few chapters ago, I went through a rather thorough explanation on Qoo-jan names and now, I have introduced a 'white' Qoo-jan, named Qa-teela. Somehow, up here in this strange grey mush I call a brain, I reasoned that her name is not different because of her skin and hair color, but rather, her skin and hair color are different because of her name. I know, I know...it doesn't any make sense to me either. Nonetheless, I will continue with it, as is. The 'white' Qoo-jan names will also be gender specific. For example, if Qa-teela were male, he'd be Qo-teelo

Help! Help! I've finally slipped off the deep end and can't find a good enough shrink that's willing to take my case!
