 Manuel followed the trail of crushed flowers, and halfway up a steep hill, he found Maria.

"Off exploring?" he asked.

Her tone was neutral, but he somehow knew that she was inwardly cursing. "The types of plants found vary quite a bit with even a small change in altitude."

"Did you know that your suit radio wasn't working? The plants you stepped on were starting to stand back up, so I thought I ought to come check on you while I could still find the trail. It seems to be working fine now, though--I'm not sure what the problem was."

"You don't need to worry. There's nothing dangerous here." She spoke with absolute certainty.

"By the way, did you see another of the bird things? I thought I saw a big one when I was walking here. From a distance, it looked almost like . . ."

"Like what?"

"I'm not sure," he said, and he knew he'd spoken a little too quickly. 

She gazed at his eyes through the faceplate of his suit, and he could swear he felt her fingers reaching into his skull. 

"I have a headache," she said at last, and together they walked silently back to camp.

He did not tell her what he had seen--what he knew he could not have seen.
