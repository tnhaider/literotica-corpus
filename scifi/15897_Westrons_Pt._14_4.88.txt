 Tudino was absolutely thrilled when I groaned and ejaculated inside her. 

- "I can feel it!" she exclaimed. 

She wanted to look at my semen, as it oozed out of her. She also wanted to touch it, to rub it between her fingers, and to smell it. She even raised her fingers to her lips, and tasted a bit - but she didn't want to waste any. 

"How do I stop it from coming out of me?" 

- "Liquid can't flow uphill." I said. 

She lay back on the bed. I tucked a pillow under her ass, so that she wouldn't try to keep legs in the air. 

- "How much does it take?" 

- "Sometimes, once is enough." 

- "But we should do it again, to make sure." she said. "Maybe a few more times." 

I had to laugh. "That's why we're here." 

- "So ... as long as my hemmer lasts?" 

- "That's the idea." I took a deep breath. "You know, it's getting even stronger." 

- "That's amazing. I've never heard of such a thing. Have you?" 

- "No. Maybe you should ask your grandmother." 

- "Oh, I will: trust me." She glanced down at my crotch. "Are you hard, again?" 

- "Not again. Still. I told you: your hemmer is very potent." 

- "How long does it take? To produce more seed?" she asked. 

- "Ready when you are." 

She would've scrambled back on top of me, but I suggested that she just roll onto her side. Somehow, I had the feeling that it would be wise to conserve my energy. I introduced her to spooning. 

- "Mmm ... that's nice." she cooed. "You know, Cook, I quite like copulating." 

- "It doesn't hurt anymore?" 

- "Not at all. It feels ... incredible. You hybrids are so lucky. You can do this whenever you want." 

- "There's something to be said for hemmer, though." 

- "Like what?" 

- "We wouldn't be here, if you didn't have one." 

- "I know." she said. "But if I was a hybrid, we could do this all the time." 

- "Who would command our regiments?" 

- "Hah! True." 

I was growing more excited, so I turned her onto her back, into the missionary position. I was still careful, worried about hurting her, but Tudino met my every thrust with a lunge of her hips. 

I came again, flooding her insides. She hadn't reached an orgasm, so I used my fingers to get her there. 

After a short rest, I convinced her that we should eat, and drink. 

- "Is that how you produce more seed?" 

- "Yes. But I can also see that I'm going to need quite a bit of energy to keep up with you." 

We sat at the table, naked. She saw me looking at her. I was trying to count her various wounds and injuries, so she helped me to see them all. 

There was the scar left by a bayonet, along her scalp. The bullet mark on the corner of her mouth. The nose - broken by an enemy elbow. Her chin - very nearly shattered by a musket ball. Her ear, missing a small piece. 

She'd had a bullet graze the top of her breast, and another break her left leg. She also had a sword scar along her ribs. "That was from a duel." she said. 

Eleven wounds in all. 

- "Have you ever considered another line of work, Tudino?" 

- "I'm good at what I do." 

That first day, we tried doggy, cowgirl again, reverse cowgirl, and then face to face, with her sitting in my lap. 

- "I like them all." she said. 

*** 

Her hemmer lasted for four days. 

We didn't fuck the whole time. In between couplings, we stopped to eat and drink. We also talked quite a bit; I wanted to know more about her family, and how they had so badly mis-diagnosed her hemmer. 

Military matters came up, too. How could they not? We had hours and hours to talk, and fuck, and talk some more. 

On the third day, I introduced to the idea of making love, as opposed to simply fucking. She took to it like a duck to water. She was especially thrilled when she had her first orgasm while I was inside her. 

- "See? This is what I meant! You hybrids have the time - the luxury of time - to think of things like this! And to practice!" 

She took it easy on me, that fourth day. She knew that Aneli had damn near killed me over three days. So we talked a little more, and cuddled longer. 

- "Cook, do you think ...?" 

- "Yes, Tudino. I will join you for your next hemmer." I said. 

She punched me in the chest. "How did you know I was going to ask that?" 

- "I guessed." 

She wrapped her arms me, and kissed me. 

- "I hope it's a girl." she said. 

*** 

I will never forget Koroba's and Nasta's looks of sheer awe as we exited the cottage, after four days. Ishana was there, too; Madze had left, because she'd gone into hemmer herself. 

The way they stared at Tudino was absolutely priceless. She'd known admiration, before, for her military skills and especially her courage. She'd never seen adulation - and envy - for her sexual prowess. 

A week later, a wagon arrived in front of the Belere. Esyle took delivery of 16 cases of wine. There was a note attached: 

A small gift, to show my appreciation to you sisters, for lending me your man. I hope that I'll be invited to your home in future, so here is some decent wine that you can serve to me when I visit. 

Yours, 

Tudino 

- "Why 16 cases?" asked Esyle. 

*** 

Yehla gave birth to a little girl, and named her Oshide. 

*** 

Esyle and Tallia asked for a moment of my time. They also asked my bodyguards - Ishana and Nasta, this time - to excuse us. 

- "It's just ... an idea we had." said Tallia. "I was explaining to Esyle how you talked to the Woles, and got them to verify and even extend some of Papa's maps." 

"And we got to thinking: what if we invited Woles to come by the house - our old house - to talk to him?" 

- "Ostensibly, they would be there to help with his maps - both Westron and Crolian territory, to allay suspicion. We could offer to pay for their assistance." said Esyle. 

I began to see where they were headed. "And while they're there, we could ask them innocent questions about what they've seen on their travels ..." 

- "Exactly!" said Tallia, with a big grin. 

- "Talley would be willing to do this?" 

- "We haven't asked him yet." said Esyle. "We came to you, first." 

- "But if it helps improve his maps, and provides useful intelligence for the army, of course he will." added Tallia. 

- "Who would ask the questions?" 

- "Not you." said Tallia. "Your bodyguards would scare everyone away. Better, I think, if it doesn't like look like the army is directly involved." 

- "Woles aren't stupid." I warned her. "But that's a wonderful idea. What would you need from me?" 

- "A list of questions you'd like us to ask." said Esyle. "And money, of course." 

I liked it; it felt like we were starting an intelligence network. But there was more. Esyle came closer, and sat on my lap, so that she could whisper in my ear. 

"I had the link boy follow Ishana the other day, when Nasta relieved her. Care to guess where she went?" 

- "Home?" 

- "To the Palace. He waited until she came out, less than half an hour later." 

- "Okay." 

Esyle leaned back, and looked me in the eye. 

- "I know they're your bodyguards, Cook - just don't forget who they work for." 

*** 

Esyle needed a little more persuasion before she agreed to attend Countess Iloni's ball. Tallia worked on her. They both agreed that we needed new clothes. 

- "I'll just go in uniform." I said. 

- "You can't!" They were both horrified. Apparently that would have been the faux pas of the half-century. 

On a formal occasion like this, women still wore breeches, but many colours other than white were allowed. It was their shirts that would set them apart. Sleeves could be long, short, wide or flowing. Necklines could be high, modest, low, or absurdly low. 

The shirts themselves could be loose, or skin-tight, as the wearer preferred. The materials were silky, or satiny, and the array of colours to choose from was astonishing. 

So were the prices. 

Jewelry was absolutely necessary, too. I could have bought a pair of six pounder cannon for what we were spending on this. But it was necessary, if Tallia and especially Esyle were to move in society, commensurate with my new status as ... well, whatever I was. 

Besides, neither sister was a fashionista. They didn't need the latest or the most avant-garde of anything. So I indulged their modest tastes to a moderate degree, and we were all happy with the results. 

The trouble started when we went to look for my clothes. 

- "A skirt?" There was no Westron word for kilt, which I would have worn with some pride. But the current fashion for male skirts was nothing short of obscene. 

Actually, that was the problem: it was so short that I felt utterly ridiculous. The damn thing was a mini-skirt. My ass was sticking out the back, and my balls were hanging out the front. 

- "Nu-uh. Not for me." 

- "But that's what males wear." protested Tallia. 

That's when I noticed the edge of Esyle's lip curling slightly. They were having me on. Tallia burst into laughter a moment later. 

- "Oh! You should have seen your face!" 

I let them enjoy their joke. When they were finished laughing, they had the tailor bring out some real skirts. 

Those didn't make me feel any better. And the shirts ... 

The whole ensemble reminded me of a cross between a pornographic vid performer, and a male stripper of the ancient world. 

- "I'm sorry, girls. I can't wear those things. I won't wear them." 

- "Seriously, Cook." said Tallia. "That's what upper class Westron males wear, at a ball, or a party. You have to wear them." 

- "Okay." I said. "Now picture your father wearing them." 

- "Eeww." 

- "Exactly. Look, it's quite simple: I'm not a Westron male. So I'll go as what I am - a Pylosian." 

With appropriate concessions to Westron culture, I ended up with a kilt that fell just below my knees, a plain white shirt, and a simple black waistcoat. New stockings, a new belt ... the girls insisted on all the accessories. 

When I was all kitted out, I felt like the lad on his way to a highland theme wedding, back on Terra. But Tallia was nodding, as she circled and studied me from every angle. 

Esyle actually clapped her hands. 

- "You look wonderful." she said. "That outfit will stand out - no doubt that's what you intended all along." 

If you can't fit in, might as well stand out. I could pretend that I'd meant to do that all along. 

Koroba and Madze had discreetly followed us as we toured the shops. Tallia (the little sneak) invited them in to see my new clothes before I changed back to my military gear. 

Madze just nodded, but she seemed impressed. Koroba was struck speechless - for a moment. 

- "Hoo-ee." she said. "You look yummy, Colonel." 

Tallia and Esyle grinned. They took that as a compliment. 

*** 

We formed a party with Langoret and her fiancée, a male named Tomos. He was short, and lean. I liked his plain, open features. He seemed like a decent guy, but I couldn't quite get over his get-up. Let's just say that I was glad I didn't have to emulate him. 

Langoret was dressed conservatively (as I'd fully expected), but she looked very elegant. She and Esyle quietly admired each other's shirts. 

All four of my bodyguards were on hand, and Langoret had an attendant as well, who would carry a lantern to light our way home. 

Avette wouldn't be coming. She didn't care for many of the people who would be there. To be honest, she probably wasn't invited in the first place. 

It was quite a procession, though, as we walked from the Belere to Countess Iloni's Palace, known as the Markviet. We encountered other parties, heading in the same direction. Some of them knew Langoret, which led to introductions. 

To me, the females looked spectacular, and the males slightly ridiculous. But no one else seemed to find anything out of the ordinary. 

There were sleeveless shirts, to show off the wearer's biceps. Wide open shirts, to display pecs and and/or abs. Bright colours, to match their hair. And finally, shirts that dipped in the back, behind the head, to reveal a trace of dorsal fur. Those were considered by far the most daring. 

Countess Iloni's home was palatial: large, with extensive gardens, and luxuriously appointed. Evidently she had money and taste (the two don't always go together). 

As the guests arrived, they joined a long receiving line. There was no other way in, and nobody else in our party reacted, so I supposed that this was normal practice. 

Just before the entrance, we could hear someone - female - announcing the names of the guests. I had a mild panic. 

- "Esyle - how's she going to know who we are?" I asked. 

- "All under control, Cook." she said, calmly. She showed me a card, whereon she'd written our names. Colonel Cook, and Esyle of Belere. 

We let Langoret go first. 

- "Countess Langoret, and the future Count Tomos!" They'd officially announced their engagement, so I guess that made Tomos a Count-in-waiting. 

"Esyle of Belere, and Colonel Cook!" The announcer read them in reverse order - or maybe it was Esyle who'd had them backwards. 

There was a sea of people inside - and this was only the entry hall. Langoret had briefed me on what to expect: food and drink to the left and right, music and dancing straight ahead. The Countess liked to stay in her spacious garden, at the rear of the Palace. We were going that way, to pay our respects to the Hostess. 

- "Cook!" 

It was Tudino. She didn't stand on ceremony: she launched herself at me, wrapping me in a big hug, and then kissing me soundly on the lips. 

- "You're late!" she said. Her eyes were bright, but she didn't look at all drunk - she'd probably only had half a dozen drinks to warm up. 

- "I believe you were early." said Langoret. 

- "Well ... show up early, and you can leave early, without offending everybody. I'm not really used to ... this sort of thing." 

- "You look wonderful." said Langoret. She did, too: Tudino was wearing a loose blue shirt, with silver piping, which brought out her eyes and set off her long black hair. 

- "Umm ... thanks." She wasn't used to compliments, either. But she let herself be persuaded to join our little party for a while. 

As we progressed through the gathering, dozens of people came over to say hello to Langoret. She introduced them all to Tomos, and then to Tudino, Esyle and me. 

- "Langoret is very well-known." I said to Esyle, after the twentieth round of introductions. 

- "Don't be fooled." she said. "Some of these people barely know her. They're more interested in meeting you. And getting a good look at me, and especially Tudino." 

- "Tudino? Because she never comes to these things? Or because of the battle of Tonol?" 

- "Neither. They're curious, because they've heard the story about her hemmer." 

- "What story?" I asked. 

- " Four days? Until now, she's been ... socially reclusive. I don't how else to put it. All of a sudden, though, she has a four-day hemmer? With you? Of course they're all curious." 

- "Don't they have anything better to do?" 

- "You must know Westrons by now - we love to talk about sex. Our own, other people's ..." 

I took Tudino aside. 

- "You know that they're talking about you?" 

- "About my hemmer? Yeah. That's all Countess Iloni and the others wanted to talk about. 'Why have we never heard of you before? Was it really four days? Tell us everything.' That kind of thing." She rolled her eyes. 

- "Not your style." 

- "Hardly." 

The music in the crowded ballroom was muted. In fact, I could barely hear it over the buzz of conversation. 

- "They will play louder, when the dancing begins." said Langoret. "How are you holding up, Cook?" 

- "So far, so good." I was on my second drink - there were dozens of waiters circulating, with trays of drinks, which rapidly found their way into the hands of thirsty guests. 

- "Are you enjoying it, though?" she asked. 

- "Not yet. Are you?" 

Being Langoret, she just gave me a half-smile, and continued to lead us towards the gardens at the back of the estate. 

There were scores more people outside, but it was easy enough to locate our hostess. There was a knot of about a dozen garishly-dressed people that everyone else seemed to be watching. Not staring, exactly; but it was easy to see that many of the guests were frequently glancing that way, or listening in that direction - while pretending not to. 

We met Aneli on the way, surrounded by a boisterous group. 

- "Cook! And Tudino!" she called out. "The heroes of the hour!" 

Okay, I didn't care for that. Tudino and I could be called heroes - but it wasn't because we'd had sex for the better part of four days straight. And to say that, with Langoret present - a genuine hero - it just felt wrong. 

Aneli was ... what she was. I wasn't going to change her. But I didn't have to like it. 

- "And the lovely Esyle!" laughed Aneli. "Most fortunate of women!" 

- "I'll talk to her." said Tudino. "You go on." 

- "Tudino!" called out Aneli. "Let's compare recollections!" 

Langoret didn't say a word. Neither did Esyle. I bit back a whole slew of them. 

The group around Countess Iloni saw us coming, but they went on pretending that they hadn't. Until the hostess deigned to acknowledge us, we didn't officially exist. 

The Countess wasn't at all what I'd expected. The most frequent, most famous hemmers in the Kingdom? I'd been picturing some sort of modern Messalina, a femme fatale to rank with the great seductresses of all time. 

She was tiny, for one thing. Five feet tall, maybe. Her hair was impressive: chestnut brown, with reddish-purple highlights. 

She saw us. Actually, she saw me. Our eyes met. Very pretty eyes, in a lovely face. 

After a moment, she whispered something. I couldn't read her lips, but the woman next to us looked up, and her glance flickered over the members of our party. She waved. 

The group around the Countess parted, and made room for us to approach. 

- "Countess Langoret." said our hostess. Okay, her voice was hot. If someone was going to bring you off without even touching you, it could be this woman. 

She and Langoret touched hands. 

"Count Tomos. Congratulations. I hope that you'll be very happy together." 

- "Thank you, Countess." he said, with a bow. 

- "Esyle." Iloni extended her hand before Esyle was even close. My lover had to step forward, and reach, so as not to appear ungrateful for the mark of favor she was being shown. It was cleverly done - and smoothly, too. I don't think that anyone else noticed. 

But I did. And my dislike of Countess Iloni probably started that very moment. 

"So glad you could join us." she said. 

- "Thank you, Countess." said Esyle. 

- "And this is the famous Colonel Cook." 

- "Countess." I bowed. 

- "We have all followed your achievements with tremendous interest." said Iloni. 

The way she said it, I knew that the 'achievements' she was referring to weren't necessarily military in nature. 

She was a hot little number; I'll grant you that. Her voice had a certain power. She had nice tits, artfully popped up. Her bright purple shirt was cleverly designed to show them off, without seeming to reveal too much. 

Deep brown eyes, trimmed eyelashes, perfect features ... she was truly lovely. 

And on top of that ... I could smell her. I could feel her, too, and on a woman who wasn't in hemmer, that was just incredible. I began to understand her hold over male Westrons; this woman could cause a riot among eunuchs. 

Unfortunately, I couldn't prevent the front of my kilt from ... bulging forward, a little. 

Countess Iloni's eyes flickered down for less than a second. But she saw it. And I saw the smile that tickled the corners of her mouth.
