 Smokey Saga #58: "On Your Shoulder"

*****

Here's another story I originally wrote as a theater play to get produced on stage. Well, that didn't happen, but I was always very fond of this funny little fairy-tale, and the upside is, I can now redo it as an erotic story. There'll be about a quarter of a sex scene in the middle and a full one at the end. I hope you'll find it worth waiting for, 'cause there's a lot of content here. And in case you're unaware, I'm only writing lesbian stories at this time; sorry, hetero-/androphiles. This is sci-fi/fantasy and also lesbian sex. The story—or script, rather—was originally written in 2008, hence the setting. Also, like my other Saga that was first penned as a play, this will switch narratives between first- and third-person. Like usual, italics here denote the intro, bold is the protagonist's first-person narration, and the bold italics are the individual segment titles and settings. We'll start with our main character's first monologue, her initial in parentheses. Enjoy, and as always, your feedback is highly valued and appreciated.
