  If BDSM bothers, then I strongly suggest you DON"T read this chapter. When voting, I want to be rated on how well my writing is, how imaginative you think it is and not someone's personal opinion on a lifestyle many people partake in. We must all realize that we are all different. BDSM is not one person treating another cruelly, but two people agreeing on a certain level of role play that might in some cases be necessary to achieve pleasure. Like your tastes in food: some like it with just salt and pepper, but others like it with lots of HOT sauce. Have a heart people. Thank you for taking the time to read this if you are going to go ahead and take the plunge and please let me know what you think, good or bad. Just no insults please. We are all adults here. LH.
