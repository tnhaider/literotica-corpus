 Jake was pacing restlessly. They'd kept him in quarantine at Ita for an additional two weeks and it was killing him not being able to hold his son.

His immune system was in shock after exposure to the atmosphere of Tansa. He would have died if it wasn't for the medicine Ita's doctors injected into his bloodstream. 

But still they had to keep him quarantined.

His body fought the pathogens with fierceness that rivalled his own at the battle of Tansa, where he disabled the entire Tansan fleet and routed entire battalions of the local militia.

He had managed to convince the government to cease all hostilities against the peaceful alien race known as the C'Nosi. He had even managed to secure everyone at the abandoned base of Ita citizenship of Tansa, in addition to diplomatic immunity.

Thanks to his actions they were finally free, and a race of sapient beings was spared the bloodshed that lasted for centuries. At least by one of the governments in the local cluster.

The quarantine was a boring ordeal, and he really wanted to see his son and wife. They had been visiting him frequently but he still missed them greatly, and talking through an intercom was no substitute for a real conversation.

Hannah was furious at what he did, but he thought he'd managed to calm her down. She was worried sick about him and wouldn't stop pestering him about it.

He'd been working on fixing and reinforcing his armour ever since. He was about to get to work on it yet again when the intercom buzzed. Doctor Lev greeted him.

"I think it's safe for you to be out of here, Jake." he heard the doctor's voice.

"Thank god." he said as he moved towards the hatch.
