 "Alright you, Zelinnia has the baby, so I'm going to take you out flying." SaTa landed at her feet. "Here, let's get your gear on."

Once the rylak was set up, Elunara climbed into the saddle. SaTa took a couple of bounces, before getting airborne. She clung to the reins for dear life.

"Alright you, let's fly in that direction. We'll see what we can find in Elwynn."

"That's where we found the sheep."

"Well, why don't you try some wolves?"

"Wolves? Wolves in Draenor were vicious and difficult to bring down."

"Not these. These are weak, our young ones train on killing them. I'm certain if you can rid the forest here of a few, the farmers would give you sheep and pigs in return."

"Oh, I guess we can try one." Sighed one. "Let's do it, sister." Snarled the other. 

Elunara dropped to the ground and watched them bring down a wolf. They ripped it apart between them. 

"Too stringy." Spat one. "Killed it, so we ate it." Sighed the other. 

"Alright, alright. The bears will probably be no better. Come on, I have another idea." Elunara climbed back in the saddle. They flew south again. "Alright, let's try the spiders."

"Spiders?" 

Elunara pointed. "That."

"Alright."

She dropped to the ground and watched them take down a spider; they made quick work of it.

"Those are tasty!" Sasha bounced her head. "Want more." Snarled Tasha.

"Well, you're welcome to take your fill. They harass everyone, no one would complain if you gorged yourself on them."

"Good." 

Elunara sketched the creature, as she bounced from kill to kill. 

"Very crunchy." Sasha dug into some leg parts. "Very filling." Tasha yawned. "Want to sleep in our nest." They said at once.

Elunara climbed back on the saddle and directed them home. Once she had their gear stowed away, they bounced on to the house. 

"How'd you manage to get one of those?"

Elunara looked up. "Hey, lover. Whatcha need?"

He pointed up at SaTa. "How?"

"She's my friend."

"Of course." He rolled his eyes. "I was hoping to catch you... Where is the baby?"

"Zelinnia's watching her while I get Sasha and Tasha some much needed exercise. 

"Ah." He scratched the back of his head. 

"Would you be more comfortable inside?"

"Ah... yeah." He grinned. 

"Come on in." 

He stepped in and sighed. "It's been awhile."

"I'm sorry, sweetie." Elunara brushed her fingers across his cheek. "I can't leave Lulu for too long. When she gets old enough to sleep through the night, it wouldn't be so bad..."

He put his hand over hers. "Perhaps if I put a crib in the room?"

With a smile, she laughed. "That'd be lovely." She pressed her lips to his. "It has been terrible... waiting almost four months."

"One or two I could handle." He muttered. "I'm just a man, after all."

"You could just come here. Everyone observes my signs and locks. You could try out my couch." She winked.

"Maybe another time."

"Still intimidated?"

"Maybe?" He grinned. 

She sighed dramatically. "Oh well." She tickled his chin. "I need to go pick up my baby from my best friend's. Care to join me?"

The rylak on the roof watched the pair walk away. 

"Do you smell that, sister?"

"Oh, I do. Very curious." 

"She already has many mates, and yet, she still claims the strongest for her own."

"Very curious she is." 

"She speaks to us as equals."

"She calls us friend."

"Yes, this pleases me too."

Elunara popped an eye open and groaned. "Oh, what is that maniac beast doing NOW?"

Grogek rubbed his head. "I believe she's gone into heat."

Giving a frustrated groan, Elunara buried her head under her pillow. 

"PLEASE shut that thing up!" Tulani whined. 

Elunara climbed out of bed and wrapped herself in one of the robes Tulani had given her. 

"The hell is that thing doing?" Jordan peered at her through one eye. 

"Grogek thinks she's gone into heat."

"At two in the damned morning?"

"Go back to bed. I'll..." Elunara sighed as Lulu began to cry.

"I'll get her." Jordan sighed and went for the baby's room. 

"SASHA! TASHA! WHAT THE HELL??"

"We are lonely!" Sasha whined. "We must find a mate!" Tasha demanded. 

Elunara buried her face in her hands. "Ok, how about this..." She crossed her arms. "You let us sleep, and WHEN I decide to get up in the morning, I will help you find a mate."

"How will YOU find us a mate?" Tasha was skeptical. 

"On the other end of Stormwind are the stables... A place you would have been left if I didn't care for you... I'm fairly certain they will have a few of you. If they don't, then I will take you out to the other stables around the world. If NONE of them have one, then I will PERSONALLY take you to Draenor to find one. Is this acceptable?"

"I guess I can wait." Sasha sighed. "This is acceptable." Tasha snorted.

Elunara sighed as she climbed the stairs. 

"I got Lulu back to sleep." 

"Thank you, Sugar." She kissed Jordan and patted his cheek.

"I swear that beast is more trouble than she's worth." Grogek sighed. 

"You're not the one who just promised to find her a damned mate." Elunara crashed into the bed.

The next day, Elunara gestured. "Alright, follow me..."

"Wouldn't it be quicker to fly?"

Elunara sighed. "I don't feel like attaching all of your stuff."

"You could hold on." Said one. "We'll be gentle." The other chimed in.

"Ok, fine." Elunara climbed on to the beast's back and held on to one of the necks. "You want to set us down in that corner."

The Rylak began to bounce across the rooftops. Elunara dropped down and held her head. "Should not have agreed to that." She muttered. 

"Hey, Elunara. Risky, riding one of those without a saddle." Tony snorted.

"Yeah, I'm out of my mind. Please tell me some adventurers have dumped a few skyreavers on you."

"In fact, I have a few. Why? Looking for advice?"

"No... mine's bugging me for a mate. I figured there's always a mount collector that doesn't take care of all of their mounts."

"Bugging...?" He laughed. "You mean two a.m. caterwauling?"

"Yes." She groaned.

"Well, I got the perfect candidate then. I mean, I got a few of them, but this one little guy never gets out." He motioned for them to follow him. "You know, even the most avid collector at least pulls them out just because. Not so much this one. We try to exercise him, but with so many animals and so few volunteers..." He patted a stable door. "Here he is."

SaTa hopped up on the edge of the door and chirped down. Soon, the two creatures were chirping back and forth rapidly and Elunara struggled to keep up with the conversation. SaTa dropped down. Elunara blinked. "Well, if you're sure."

"Do... you understand them?"

"Yeah, and SaTa wants him out." Elunara nodded. "She says her last master was a bastard too, so she wants this one."

"Well, you know if he summons the beast..."

"We'll deal with that when we come to it." She blinked. "You want me to name him?"

"He will understand us better." SaTa replied. 

"Uh, ok." Elunara considered and tapped her foot. "Argus and Bargus. I'll call him Argy."

SaTa chirped happily, before turning and exchanging another swath of dialog. 

"Alright, alright." Elunara stooped down and removed Argy's armor. "I'll keep it safe."

The pair of Rylaks hopped into the air. 

"I can't believe you can understand it."

"Her. Them. Sort of? It takes some getting used to, but it's kind of like they project pictures and beliefs, rather than words and sentences."

"Freaky. I wonder if all of them do it."

"From what I understand, it's how the two heads communicate with each other."

"So, how did you come by that one?"

"PVP adventurer was using her to taunt guards, and almost got her killed. I saved her and she... detached from her previous owner."

"Wild."

"So, now you have two..." Grogek put his hands on his hips. 

"As long as it keeps her quiet and out of trouble, I don't give a damn."

He nodded. "I agree."

"Well, she's gone two weeks without giving me a headache, so there's that." With a laugh, she started to step in the house, but the pair began to screech. "I spoke too fucking soon." Elunara sighed. "WHAT NOW?"

"He's being taken from me!" SaTa flew in circles, frantic.

"My master calls!" Argy bounced.

"Elunara is your master now!" Tasha growled.

Argy disappeared. 

SaTa laid on the roof and began to wail.

Elunara groaned. "I should have gone for a wild Draenor beast first." She ducked in the house and scooped up the now wailing Lulu. All at once, the clatter outside the house changed. She stepped out and blinked at the two fighting Rylaks. "Oh, WHAT NOW?"

Grogek shrugged. "Argy appeared within a minute of you going in the house. I understand nothing after."

Elunara passed the baby to Grogek. "YOU TWO SHUT IT!"

"He is a FOOL!" Tasha hissed. 

"Start talking."

Argy dropped to the ground, distraught. "My master finally calls for me! Joy, elation! Then... then he sends me back. There were others... a parade of us! But, master got bored of the festival, and dismissed me back." Argy did what passed as a Rylak weeping. "To be called on after so long, only to be sent back..."

"Oh, Argy..." She tugged one of those massive heads into her lap. "Dear, Argy... What is better? To hide in a box, waiting for a master that doesn't care for you? Or to fly free with your mate?"

"But, what am I to do?" One sighed. "He is our master." Grumbled the other.

"SaTa had a master, and she broke the contact. Next time he tries to summon you, just break the contact. You don't need him."

"I want to stay here." One whispered. "With our mate." Sighed the other. 

"Then do it." She scratched his head. "Here, you are friend. Not slave." She scratched the other chin. 

Both heads looked up longingly at SaTa. "Then we will." They said. With a bounce, they were sky born.

Several days later, humming to herself, she filled in the fine details of her work. Still focused on her commission, she tugged the door open. 

"Give me back my mount!" The man pointed to the sky.

She looked up. "Looks like a normal pair of Rylaks."

"I know it was you!"

"Know what was me?" She whistled. 

Argy landed on the porch roof. "That was master."

Looking up, she grinned. "I know."

"Listen here, bitch."

"I'm listening." She cocked her head to the side, but didn't take her gaze off of her work. 

He reached out and ripped the page off of her board. 

"Hey! You arrogant little shit!"

"Give me back my mount! I paid good money for that damned thing!"

She punched the man in the face. Picking up her paper, she growled. "You stupid little asshole." She tucked the page in the board and tossed it back on her counter, before diving out of the door. She grabbed him by his hair and kicked his body repeatedly. "You're not worthy of having a mount." She threw him across the yard. "I don't care who the fuck you are. You don't insult my friends, OR damage my work!"

Yoona and Savage bounded out of the door, teeth bared, as they growled. Both SaTa and Argy landed with the pair and began to screech and spit. The commotion brought several guards, and even Mark and Gerald appeared from seemingly nowhere. 

"Is there a problem?" Mark cracked his knuckles.

"This little shit insulted my friends AND tore up my work!"

Gerald snorted. "Dude, I'd fucking run."

The man turned and scrambled away. 

Elunara sighed. "I'll have to start over from scratch." 

"That sucks." Mark frowned. 

"Thanks for the assistance guys." She gave each animal a scratch. "I believe I had it by that point." She patted both men on the cheek and walked back to the house. 

Elunara opened the door. "Hello, lover. What can I do for you?" She leaned against the door frame.

A man popped out from behind Varian. "That's the huntard that took my mount!"

Varian raised an eyebrow. "Since when are you a hunter?"

"Hell if I know." She shrugged. "Hey, dimwit, I'm a priest and a rogue, but I am no hunter."

"She used Stampede! I saw her!"

"Ohhhh, you mean these guys?" She jerked her thumb at Savage and Yoona. "They're mounts, they're not pets. In fact, all four animals that ran you off the other day were all mount types. Since I actually treat my mounts well, they're my friends, and as such, leapt to defend me. Not that YOU have any concept of what that's like."

"I don't give a shit, give me back my mount!"

"I can't give what I didn't take. Well over a month ago, my rylak was feeling lonely, so I took her to the stables, and asked if they had any that needed some exercise. They pointed me to one that hadn't been called on in over two freaking years, so we volunteered to give him some attention. Not MY fault he fell in love with mine and now they're a mated pair."

"Lonely? Love?" The man scoffed. "The fuck are you talking about?"

"Emotions you have no concept of. Then this little fuckshit shows up and starts harassing me, and he tore up my commission!" She gestured.

"The fuck do I care about your commissions?"

Varian shook his head. "I've heard plenty."

"Yeah, give me back my mount!"

"Oh, you misunderstand." Varian put a hand on the man's shoulder and squeezed. "I do not appreciate you harassing one of Stormwind's most valuable citizens. Your best bet would be going back to the mount vendor and asking for your refund. Else wise..." Varian lowered his voice. "Leave her alone, or declare yourself at war with our faction. That is your choice." He shoved the man off the porch. "See that he's dealt with." He said to the guards. Varian bowed to Elunara. "Forgive us for interrupting your day."

She waved a hand. "Think nothing of it." With a wink, she grinned. "I know I won't."
