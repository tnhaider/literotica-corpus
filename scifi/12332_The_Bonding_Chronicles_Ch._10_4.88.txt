 ***** New Beginnings *****

Sara collapsed into Andrew's arms, her swollen midsection pressing against his side as she melted into his embrace. The sensation elicited a soft moan from the exhausted young woman as she felt her contents jostle against him. Her pussy tensed as she thought about the veritable ocean of cum that he had packed into her athletic body.

"Seriously, Andrew. What the hell are you doing to me?" She licked her lips, savoring their combined flavors while she waited for a response.

Andrew chuckled to himself and rubbed her large belly with a possessive gleam in his eyes. "Just wait, kitten. Just wait."

The truth was that Andrew had little idea what he was doing, and hoped that his magical gift was fulfilling his desire. Invoking the spell from the night before had been simple, the symbols having been etched within his memory by the force of their orgasms. He knew that for as long as he lived he would never forget that spell, or finish giving praise to his gift for blessing him with the knowledge of it.

He watched the leaves within the canopy sway at a peaceful pace, their movements slowed by the languid march of time that existed within that magical place. Andrew smiled and looked down at Sara, her vibrant light brown eyes shining up at him from where she clung to his chest. The trust that he could see within that gaze took his breath away.

She leaned forward and pecked him on the lips before yawning and wiggling against his tender pectoral muscles. He could still feel the dull ache of pleasure all through his body from the plentiful and powerful orgasms that they had shared. Sara closed her eyes and allowed the siren song of sleep to consume her. Andrew fought the temptation for as long as he could, enjoying the rhythmic breathing of the woman he loved as she rested against him.

He lost his battle, allowing sleep to overtake him as he basked in the sensations of lust and passion that poured from Karen's sprite within his mind, the flirty little azure vixen fluttering around the monolith that stood tall and proud, silhouetted against the sea of energy which swirled and roiled at his core. It felt like the energy had not grown since yesterday, and as consciousness left him the last thought that crossed his mind was to wonder where all of the energy they had generated that night had gone.

The lovers woke many hours later, the exhaustion of their erotic coupling and the emotions of the evening having drained them more than they had known. Sara's tummy was trim and firm again, her muscles flexing beneath her soft and supple skin as she stretched beside her waking man.

"Morning, sleepyhead."

Andrew laughed at Sara's playful tone, and realized something. "You slept all night, didn't you?"

Sara raised an eyebrow as she shared his realization. "You're right, I did. Wait, the same thing happened last night too."

Andrew continued laughing as he rubbed her firm belly and said, "Wonder what could have been different these last two nights."

Sara jumped up and laughed at Andrew as she ran her hands over her midsection. She missed the feeling of being full with Andrew's cum. Her body trembled as she remembered how it felt to be stretched to accommodate the large quantity of his rich, thick fluids.

She peered down at Andrew who had his arms crossed behind his head, his violet gaze fixed upon her with a broad smile. The lust that he saw on her face faded as a predatory grin spread from ear to ear.

"We never trained tonight," Sara observed, as she watched a worried look shadow her boyfriend's face.

The sound of Sara's foot impacting the mossy ground followed Andrew as he rolled to the side and sprung to his feet. She was far too fast for Andrew to outdistance, and far too agile for him to outmaneuver. It was in that moment that he found himself in the unenviable position of having to block and evade Sara's lightning-fast attacks.

Sara laughed and revelled in the joy she felt as she stalked Andrew around the glade. Her clumsy and slow boyfriend fumbling to evade her attacks. He never ceased trying, and she admired him for that. What Andrew lacked in natural gifts, he more than compensated for with determination and perseverance.

Andrew blocked an attack here, and dodged an attack there. His practice with his father had allowed him to take a lot of the impact out of Sara's fearsome strikes, and as they continued their impromptu battle he found himself laughing along with his girlfriend. The simple fact was that Sara was just too fast for him to hold any hope of standing against her.

As the minutes bled together they found the combat shifting between battle and chase, based on the demands of the moment. The glade became their playground and Sara enjoyed watching Andrew find his way out of each of her assaults. She was careful to slow her attacks and land her hits with just enough force to spur him into action, his wiry muscles working to meet her reckless pace as she kept him moving at the edge of his ability.

What had started as a frantic and uncontrollable flight of instinct and survival resolved into a moment of clarity for Andrew. While her hands moved fast, the hours of training his mother had given him were paying dividends. Her body telegraphed her attacks well before her arms and legs were in motion, and that provided Andrew the insight to be able to start blocking and dodging more of her attacks, her relentless and lightning-fast strikes forcing his body to react without his mind over-analyzing every single moment.

Sara harried Andrew from one side of the glade to the other. Andrew attempted a few attacks, but his untrained strikes were comical at best, his failed offense opening him up to a few punishing hits from his eager adversary. The two young combatants lost track of time as the battle waged on. Every pitch proved a learning experience for each partner, forcing them to adjust to the ever-changing tapestry of their engagement.

While Andrew lacked the physical ability to capitalize on Sara's subtle weaknesses, they did provide him enough of an edge to make her work for every hit. By the time their bodies grew tired, and Andrew was forced to jump into the pond to escape his attacker, they'd fought for a solid three hours. Andrew had been so focused on every heated moment of their wild and frenzied dance that he had failed to realize the sheer scale of time that had drifted by.

Sara basked in every single moment, savoring the contest as Andrew challenged her to find new ways to approach her assault, the revitalizing magic of the glade keeping their stamina up and their fatigue down. She knew with every passing moment just how special this time with Andrew was, and how much fun she got to have with him.

They drifted in the cool pond waters, the gentle current soothing their muscles. They giggled and laughed as their hearts settled from the intensity of the experience. Andrew found his way to Sara and swaddled her in his arms, kissing her with a passion that flowed from his very soul. Sara had driven him to survive by instinct, something he had never been willing to do until then, and in that moment he found that he was capable of far more than he ever knew possible.

"Thank you," he whispered.

Sara rested her forehead against him as they bobbed in the mystical waters, puzzled by what Andrew was so appreciative of.

He could see the confusion on her face, and knew that she had no idea how she had challenged him, or what it had meant to him.

"You always find something within me that I never knew existed, and find amazing ways to bring it out of me. You are wonderful, sexy and supportive. Everything I never knew I wanted, and now could never live without."

Their kiss was gentle and caring, expressive of the devotion that the two teens held for each other. Much like their combat, they lost all sense of time as they settled into that one simple act.

They returned home not long after that. Sara could smell his parents' sex the moment they opened the door. It wasn't until they were crossing in front of Dave and Michelle's bedroom that Andrew caught the smell himself. Sara was grateful that he never heard the deep moans that his parents attempted to mask as the two teens crossed the hallway. His parents had never stopped their love making, and Sara could almost sense their excitement at trying to be quiet, lest they get caught.

The confession from Sara about the importance of their family and how valuable they were to her, caused his parents to invite her to stay the night. Their reminder for the two teens to refrain from sexual activities while they were home seemed a bit ironic to Sara, as she listened to Michelle struggling to keep from screaming out in pleasure.

"What's so funny?" Andrew asked as they closed the door to his room.

She considered telling him the truth, but knew that was a bridge too far. "Nothing, just admiring how happy being here makes me."

Andrew pecked her on the cheek and reinforced his feelings with a simple statement, "You're exactly where you belong now."

The joyous look on Sara's face made Andrew happy beyond words. They settled into bed and Sara read some of her favorite excerpts from their English book from class to Andrew. As the hours passed they continued to share and talk, finding great comfort in the presence of the other person. Sara took a couple of naps while Andrew read through a few books, snacking on bread and a few apples and oranges he had quietly fetched from the kitchen.

Before they knew it, the sun began to rise, and Andrew and Sara made their way out of their room, ready to help get Andrew's folks out on their assignment.

When his parents started a new assignment, things always seemed to follow a similar pattern. His mother would wake up super early, and fret over every detail of the house, Andrew and anything else that she could find to distract herself from the fact that she was leaving her son to fend for himself. By the time their "Pickup Private" — a term Andrew had coined for the soldier tasked with picking up his parents — arrived, she was cold and distant, realizing that there was nothing further she could do, and overcompensating because she didn't want Andrew to worry.

His father would do his best to pretend that everything was normal. He would drink his coffee near a window, flipping through a magazine and doing everything in his power to seem nonchalant. Andrew always saw through the mask that his father wore, and prided himself on being one of the few people in the world capable of doing so. He never revealed to the gruff man that he knew what he was doing, and always just took pleasure from the farewell hug that he received; a hug that was far more firm than it needed to be, the pressure of the embrace telling Andrew that he would be okay.

So it was a surprise when Andrew and Sara came into the living room and found both of his parents in the kitchen. The morning light drifted through the window while Michelle worked on getting the fire in the stove started.

"Good morning! You're both up early," Michelle observed as she watched them enter.

"Thought it would be nice to spend these last few moments with you!" Sara provided, before she went to the fridge and started pulling out ingredients for breakfast.

The two women settled into cooking, a soft and quiet banter taking form as they cracked open eggs and began mixing a batter. Dave stood and walked over to Andrew, gripping his son's shoulder. He squeezed and was pleased by the small but firm muscles he felt spreading out over Andrew's upper back.

"Got a minute for a walk?"

Andrew looked at the nervous expression on his father's face before he responded, "Well I was going to take the airplane out for a spin, but I guess I could do that later."

Sara and Michelle chuckled from the kitchen, having taken a break from their preparations to eavesdrop on the boys' conversation.

"I'll take that as a 'yes,' smartass," Dave chuckled, as he rested his hand on Andrew's back and led him to the door.

Dew had formed on the windows of both of the cars that sat in their driveway. The dim morning light had built in intensity, and for a minute the two men walked side-by-side down the quarter-mile stretch of road leading off of their property.

"Everything okay, Andrew?"

Dave was still looking forward, seeming to admire the cars that sped by on the freeway out ahead of them.

"Are you kidding? Things are amazing right now." Andrew wanted to temper the excitement in his voice, but knew he failed as his speech picked up speed.

His father chuckled, and slapped him on the back. "You have really stumbled into someone special, son. We are happy for you." His father smiled over at him, and then his face became serious as he took a deep breath and continued. "For some reason I can't shake the feeling that there is something going on that you two aren't telling us."

Dave looked over, confirming his suspicion in Andrew's startled eyes. "Don't worry. You can keep it to yourselves. God knows I kept plenty of secrets from my parents. Payback time, I guess."

They continued to walk in silence, Andrew trying to figure out if he should say something, and what to say if he did. Dave kept stealing glances at the short man walking beside him, and was pleased as he realized that he finally saw him as just that, a man.

"Just promise me one thing, son. Never think that you have to deal with things by yourself. Your mother and I are here for you and Sara. If things ever start to get out of control, promise me that you will reach out to us." 

Dave stopped walking, and gripped his son by the shoulders with his large hands. The tall man settled his steely gaze on Andrew before he smiled and said, "I'm proud of who you have become, son. We both are. I can't pretend to understand your struggles, but something tells me you're stepping into a much more dangerous period of your life. One thing your mother has taught me is to trust my instincts, and right now they are screaming at me to postpone this assignment and protect you."

Andrew appreciated his father's worry, but knew that there was nothing for him to be concerned over. Will had been dealt with, and Zack continued to maintain their truce. He smiled and was about to protest when his father grinned and shook him, interjecting.

"I know, I know. You've got this. But still, if things change, just call. A month is a long time."

For the first time in more years than Andrew could remember, he was pulled into his father's protective arms, and he felt his father taking comfort from the embrace. Their relationship had been built on a cold stoicism that rarely faltered, but in that moment, they both knew those walls would need to come down. Andrew had forgotten how comforting and sheltered it felt within his father's powerful embrace, his large arms and firm muscles swathing him in a cocoon of warm security.

Andrew shook his head and chuckled, "Just when I think life has finished changing."

Dave's deep rumbling laugh reverberated through Andrew's ears, before the large man stated something truer than he knew.

"There does seem to be something magical about this place."

***** Like Father, Like Son *****

The morning was bittersweet for the young couple. Dave and Michelle felt the tension, but somehow the group had turned it into a sweet farewell. Pancakes and sausage were shared over hopeful conversation and speculation about what the next month would bring. By the time Private First Class Johnson arrived to pick up his commanding officers, the hugs had already been shared and emotions ran high. 

Tears streamed down Sara's face as she watched the older couple exit the house. The words Dave had whispered to her as they hugged goodbye still rang in her ear, "It's your job to watch out for Andrew while I'm gone." The iron gaze he had given her as they pulled apart reminded her of his trust and confidence in her abilities.

Andrew and Sara watched the black Range Rover as it pulled away from the house and headed towards the freeway, its tinted windows hiding its occupants from suspicious eyes as it sped towards their classified location. The vehicle rode low on its shocks and Andrew realized that it must be heavily armored.

Once the vehicle vanished from sight the young couple embraced. For Andrew, it was a bitter experience that he knew far too well. It however, was Sara's first time dealing with something like that, and her mind settled on the few experiences she had to compare it with. While she still had a relationship with her mother, it had never been the same. Their relationship was never able to recover from the betrayal she experienced from her father. In the end, her mother moving out had been the best thing for both of them, but she couldn't help feeling abandoned. 

With that memory fresh in her mind, she had a hard time imagining Andrew's parents returning. While she knew better, she couldn't shake the feeling of rejection as she listened to their vehicle fade away. Andrew could sense her forlorned emotions through their bond, and knew that this must be difficult for her. He knew through experience that they would be back much sooner than they said.

"Don't worry, kitten. We will see them in a couple of weeks. Once the construction gets started and dad has the troops hard at work, things will settle enough for them to come back."

Sara pulled back and smiled into Andrew's tender gaze. She knew he was right, as she watched the loving twinkle behind his eyes.

"Besides, they probably want to make sure we don't turn this place into Sodom and Gomorrah."

They both laughed and held each other for several moments. Andrew sighed, finding the absence of his parents much easier to deal with, having Sara there to comfort him.

Soon, the few preparations left for their day had been taken care of, and the young couple found themselves parking their new car outside the school. The large building seeming far less scary to Andrew, who stepped out of the vehicle and admired the busy school while he adjusted himself over his pants.

"You know, I would be happy to do that for you," Sara offered as she closed her door.

Andrew shook his head and hoisted his heavy rucksack onto his shoulder. "Yeah, well, we should attend school, and if you get started, I don't think we will stop anytime soon."

Sara skipped over to him and the car chirped as she locked the doors before pocketing the keys. Pulling the small man against her she lamented, "Yeah, yeah...school first, games later."

They shared a tender kiss before crossing the parking lot and starting their school day. Andrew and Sara were pleased by how little the students seemed to care about their affectionate presence amongst them. Andrew was surprised by how quickly his relationship had settled into the fabric of the school, and was eager to get into a more normal routine.

Of course as they parted before first period — his heart fluttering from Sara's goodbye kiss and playful shimmy — he was reminded that not all aspects of a normal routine were ideal. Physics was arduous as Dr. Blake had seemed to make it his mission to stump Andrew. Zack appreciated the reprieve with an overt joy at the barrage of questions that the teacher directed towards his nemesis. The A-students twisted with frustration every time their raised hands went unnoticed by the teacher.

Almost an hour later Andrew's mind was awash with every bit of knowledge he possessed about the class. Dr. Blake had jumped through the entire quarter's lesson plan, seeking anything that would be outside of Andrew's expertise. It was with tremendous frustration as the bell rang, that the teacher was forced to release his victim. Dr. Blake almost broke his pen in anger as he watched Andrew pick up his rucksack and flee into the hallway. The boy had never even opened his bag, let alone a book.
