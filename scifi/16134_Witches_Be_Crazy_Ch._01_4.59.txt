 There's a lot of action in this one. Hopefully action you'll like. This part has very soft elements of Mind Control. It's also the first part in a bigger world. Don't know how that will work. I'll figure it out later.

Hentaikitten edited this story. s_pearce helped me with the idea. Both of them have their own stories that I do recommend but not until after you've read this one, okay? 

I really hope you do enjoy this story.

I opened the front door and let Markus into my small student apartment.

"So? What was so important I had to come right over?" Markus sounded annoyed, as if he had something better to do on a Sunday night.

"Just go into the kitchen and tell me if I'm imagining what's in there." I tried to keep the strain out of my voice but from his worried look, I failed miserably. Oh well, I was past the point of caring. 

Markus skulked into my kitchen with his cautious eyes darting around. "What am I supposed to see?" 

I followed Markus into the kitchen and a sigh of relief escaped me; the dark, dangerous lady wasn't real. Stress-induced hallucinations weren't that uncommon in the third year of engineering. I was stressed out of my mind and reacted to it in a normal, healthy way. I should look up how to deal with the stress. Let me add that to my to-do list but first I had my lab reports. I had a couple of hours until the midnight deadline. 

Then I should study for the exam tomorrow morning and I hadn't slept enough, maybe this weekend I could squeeze some in. Who am I kidding? There was no way I would have any serious rest until after midterms. I could keep it together for two weeks. No problem. Just some stress induced hallucinations. 

"That poster's very well done. The open sexuality with the backlighting to keep it mysterious. It really has this dangerous seduction vibe. I didn't take you for the succubus type." 

Fuck. I wasn't seeing things. Fucking fuck. 

"It looks so life like." Markus took two steps closer to my window and leaned in. "Where did you buy it?"

"I didn't. It just showed up."

Markus reached out and his right hand touched it. I held my breath and prepared for Markus to freak out the same way I had but -- nothing happened. The lady stayed still. She didn't move. Ok, maybe the poster was real and I was only hallucinating the movement part. Still bad but not as bad as I feared.

"You think I pranked you? That's why you called me?"

"Yes." That sounded like a much better reason than 'I freaked out because a poster appeared in my window and the red seductress in the picture moved.'

Markus turned to me and said, "I didn't do it." The lady winked. Fuck. My sanity was slipping away. She mocked me, winking when Markus wasn't looking. Yeah right. That totally happened.

Markus' face changed. "I swear I didn't. One of the seniors? That Amber chick? She always had a wicked sense of humor and this chick would be right up her alley. If you know what I mean."

Amber. Of course. That little minx. Markus was right. The weird marks, slender waist, big perky breasts, deep red eyes, cute button nose, short black hair that framed her heart-shaped face, was right up Amber's alley. Of course, that was probably a description of everyone's type. But no, that didn't work.

"She finished her degree last semester and went to America." 

"So one of the seniors doing their graduation pranks then." The poster did an exaggeratedly slow thumbs up and then went back to shape. "I understand that you're freaking out man, no one wants their home broken into but just take a deep breath. I'll take care of it and I'll find out who did it so we can plan some sweet revenge."

Markus charged into action. I sat and followed orders. In, out, in, out. 

Markus opened the window then got out a key and split open the glass. Exactly the same way I had done before calling him. He saw the same thing I did. Just a black stone surface. There was no poster or anything inside the glass. He knocked with his first knuckle against the stone, producing a soft tapping sound.

Markus eyebrow shot up and he got that thousand yard stare in his eyes. He grabbed the knife from the table and stabbed it hard in the corner. Nothing happened. "Some kind of protective poly matter?" He leaned in and sniffed at the stone. "It really looks and smells like granite but that would be impossible. There's no way this thin a layer of granite would hold anything." 

Markus ran his hand through his short dark hair. It looked familiar, his own little tick. No matter what changed we stayed the same and I wasn't crazy before.

The lady was forgotten and it was Markus and I, solving a problem, together. We had done this since that time he found my hiding spot. The place I went to be left alone and read Harry Potter. Gosh it had already been fifteen years.

His chocolate brown eyes were full of concern, the deep bags under his eyes weren't as bad as mine. "How much sleep are you getting, by the way?" 

"Not enough."

"More or less than six hours?" He leaned in closer, as if trying to intimidate me. That he was a decimeter (4") shorter than me and a bit fluffy didn't help.

"Less." A lot less.

"That explains why you're freaking out about a prank. Go get some sleep." 

"Can't, have lab to write and math exam tomorrow." 

"Just send in whatever you've got right now and tell Mr Tornberg you sent in the wrong version. He'll let you complete it later, you're his golden boy. A good night's rest will help you more than any last minute cram." 

"I..." 

"No arguing. Bed - right now - or I call your mother." 

There was resolution in Markus eyes. If there's one thing I didn't need right now it's my mother coming down here to fuss over me. The woman loved me but she never understood the concept of personal space or alone time. "Fine." The word was laced with all the venom I could muster. 

Markus smiled, closed the window and pushed me towards the shower.

A big breakfast is the first step to acing any exam. The lady in the window watched my every move. Her face grew closer and closer as I cooked bacon. Soon it looked like her nose was pressed against the glass. Her nails tapped against the glass, producing a soft tapping sound. 

Not only visual hallucinations but audible as well. I was losing it. Just two more weeks and I could check myself into the loony bin. Just two weeks of exams and lab reports. I could do it. 

*** Danny ***

The exam was actually simple. Disappointingly enough I had an answer for every question and finished with enough time to recheck my answers twice, catching a couple of careless mistakes each time. 

After only five hours and fifteen minutes I handed in my test. So with a full forty-five minutes to spare I was free. Free to start over and prepare for the next exam on Friday.

Three and a half day to study for an exam and finish a lab report. I could get some well-earned rest today and start tomorrow. Wait, no, I had to finish the lab from yesterday. Fudge. No rest for the wicked.

*** Danny ***

The lady in the window became just another thing in my life to deal with. Every time I came home she greeted me with the enthusiasm of a dog. Just having something waiting for me to come home was a thrill. Her happiness depended on me and I could provide it. The stress felt easier to manage somehow with that one easy task. My mind grew clearer and I got more work done.

Every break I walked into the kitchen and there she was wagging her long black tail and smiling at me. Somewhere inside I was cracking. My mind fought it but I was slowly going insane. What kind of man has a pretend friend at twenty five? Much less a red, pin-up devil. 

*** Danny ***

The Friday and Monday exams went perfectly. I got back two reports with minor issues and I turned them back in again. Two others passed with flying colors and I only had two more to fix and the last exam on Friday. The dreaded two variable analysis. Everyone and their mother hated this course. The pass rate on the first try was ten percent. Most students were fourth years who had to retake it or they couldn't graduate. 

Which brings us to late Thursday, early Friday. I was just done with my last run-through and walked into the kitchen. For the first time I found her sleeping. Her forehead rested against the glass as she gently snored. The picture sparked an impulse in me. A drive I didn't knew I had. 

I walked up to her and leaned down and whispered, "Good night," and pressed my lips against her forehead. When I tried to pull back I couldn't, my lips were glued to the dark. 

She pulled her head back with a surprised yelp. A lurch dug into my stomach as I was pulled in. Her arms came up around my neck, somehow freeing my lips from her face and she heaved as my body flew through the window.

There was a ripping sound as my clothes stayed on the other side. I could feel the window closing around me and her face scrunched up with a touch of concern. She reached down around my shoulders and pain shot through my body as she pulled hard. With a loud pop, my sandals gave way and she took two steps back before crashing us to the ground. Pain shot through me as my knees scraped against the stone floor. 

What the fudge had just happened? 

A melodic laughter brought her back to my attention and a soft voice in my head went, *Finally. I had almost given up but now I have you.*

Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck. 

*There will be time for that later, mortal one.* 

It's a nightmare, just a nightmare. 

*You're quite rude.* 

The imaginary demon monster thinks I'm rude. Just pinch the arm to make sure it's not... 

Pain shot through me as two of her nails pinched me hard enough to make me bleed. 

So not a dream, a hallucination then.

*Why do you insist things right in front of you aren't real.*

"Because I live in the real word and in the real world you aren't brought through a mirror into an alternate dimension by a sex goddess."

Her eyes flared and there was a snap as her whip-like tail hit the ground. *I'm a demon of lust. No mere goddess.*

I took in a shocked breath through my nose and there was a sweet smell in the air. A pink mush came down over my mind. My hand gripped her hips and I laid my weight on her. Her big breasts felt awesome against my chest and her soft lips welcomed mine. Her hands reached up and pulled my head closer, returning my passion many times over. Her legs embraced me and her hips gyrated, bringing a soft teasing feeling to my now rock-hard erection. My hips moved on their own, bucking my penis against her. Pleasure shot through my body as she enticed me to go faster. A tightness inside me built. 

Fuck --Wait -- I have seen this porno before. I cum, I die.

*No of course not, mortal one. I have waited a long time for someone to show up. I'm going to heal you, keep you fed and milk all the pleasure I can. You have a hundred years of pleasure in front of you. So let go. Just take that big load and cover me in it. Let me feel your pleasure. I want you to cum. Give in. Cum for me.*

The tingling shot through my body. Her soft slit rubbed against my hard cock. My hands held on to her hips for dear life. Her loud moans drew me closer and closer to the edge. 

*Don't delay. Cum for me right now. Show me how sexy you think I am and just cum. I want you to splatter your load all over my body. Cover me in your spunk. I need you to cum. I'm so close, just cum for me.* 

This overwhelming wave of pleasure hit me hard as I emptied my sack. 

*** Danny *** 

With the passion gone the shooting pain made itself known. My tortured knees screamed at me. My back had long, deep scratches from her nails and my penis was bruised. It was like waking up with a bad hangover. Everything hurt.

*Now, now, enough of that. You ruined my moment.*

The red, demon lady of lust, pressed her fingers against my forehead and the pain went away. That was handy. Wait-- why hadn't she done it before? 

I was drugged and raped. I should feel terrible. Why didn't I feel deeply violated? 

I was raped by a red, demon lady. I have bigger problems than being drugged. 100 years of fucking and being kept a prisoner. Fuck that. How do I get out of here? 

Where is here? The room was small, about 5x2x2 meters. It's some kind of man/monster-made cave dug out of granite and one heavy, oak door was the only way out.

*You're too loud.*

The pink fog came back and made it hard to focus on anything but her big, red lips. My breathing grew shallow, my heart raced, I was on the verge of losing control, my panic attack incoming. 

1+1=2, 2+2=4, 4+4=8, 8+8=16, 16+16=32, 32+32=64, 64+64=128, 128+128=256,

"I'm in control. I'm calm. Yeah, right. I'm angry and this thing is trying to control me. She has to stop." 

Her full, juicy lips are there. All I have to do is reach out and kiss them. The pressure will go away.

No, I'll lose control again. Never again. 

I reached up, took both her hands and pinned them against the floor. She resisted but she was nowhere near strong enough.

*What are you doing? -- Stop that.*

I needed a way out. The pressure made it hard to think. The anger boiled up. This little fucker tried to control me? I don't think so. I leaned over and pressed my body weight into her.

*Yes. Just a small kiss.* 

The darkness pressed closer. I had to fight. I dragged one arm up so I could lean my elbow against her throat.

*Stop that.* The pressure crushed against me. 

Instead of a voice, a shrill sound scrambled my mind. Pain traveled down my spine. A hammer pounded my brain. Gall traveled up my throat.

A bright light flashed into existence and I closed my eyes. For a short second the total darkness was debilitating before images flashed. A beautiful lady was held down and controlled by a much bigger demon. His big horns scraped her skin and heavy slaps hit her bottom, causing a mixture of pain and pleasure to run through her. 

The pressure went away. More images flashed past. Too fast for me to make sense of them. The wall of pleasure hit me. Her body stopped fighting as she convulsed. She was dead, I had finally killed her. Relief went through my body and I rolled over. I was free from her, now I just needed to get out of here.

A heavy stone dropped in my gut as her loud gasp crushed all my hopes. Fucking fuck-fuck.

*That was so good. Maybe you can be my master.* 

I had to fight. My body screamed in pain when I tried to make it move. 

Wait, Master? 

*Yes, Master.* 

She prowled closer. Her breasts swayed as she reached over me. Her soft lips touched mine and my pain went away with a soft click. More images flashed past. 

*Name me, Master.*

Name her? What did I know about naming stuff? Fuck. She was going to kill me if she didn't like the name.

Her tails swished and her lips drew up in a cruel smile.

A Red, Demon Lady of Lust. RDLL. Ardell.

*That's so good. Now command me, master.* 

She meant it. This crazy little demon got off on being strangled and wanted more. 

*Yes please.* 

Oh fuck me. 

Lightning fast her hand reached out and grabbed ahold of my erection and her tight pussy came down hard, enveloping my hardness fully. The pink fog came back and my whole body ached with lust. 

Stop that. 

*What?* 

You're trying to manipulate me with some kind of magical need. Stop it right now. 

*Yes, master.* 

Her hot, wet, tight pussy pulsated around my dick, milking me for pleasure. Her hands leaned on my chest as she moved, her big breasts moved more as the action picked up. Her pleasure radiated from her body but something was missing. She wasn't satisfied. She wanted something more. 

I reached up and my hand gripped her hair. There was a spike in happiness from her. She wanted it rough, to be controlled and I was letting her be in charge. I pulled her closer until her mouth was on mine, devouring my lips. Her tongue fought mine and her spike went down again. I wasn't doing this right. She wasn't like anyone else I'd had sex with. I pulled back and her red eyes stared into mine. 

You're getting ahead of yourself, slave.

*Fuck, Yes!* 

Hold still. 

Her whole body froze and I could feel the anticipation oozing from her. She was curious about what I'd do next. I reached down and took hold of her hips, giving me the ability to fuck her hard. My need built, the first tinglings of the impending explosion traveled down my spine.

*Yes, cum for me.* 

The bottom of every impact, her clit shot waves of pleasure through her body. Her tight little body convulsed, looking to milk me of every ounce of joy it could. Her two full breasts were heavenly against my chest, egging me on. With each impact they swayed and sent pleasure through my body. I was about to fill her up but I could feel how she wasn't ready yet. My hand reached down to her clit and she just exploded. Her whole body scrunching together as she came around my cock. 

*Yes, yes. Fuck yes.* 

She convulsed and I waited, very impatiently, for her to finish. 

I took the last of my pleasure out of her. The rhythm became a frenzied mix as my dick squeezed the last pieces of strength out of me. 

*Yes, that's it, you feel so good inside of me, just cum for me, I want you to cum, feed me your sperm, I want it all, just cum deep in my tight pussy, be a good master and take care of your slave, give it to me.* 

The wave of pleasure started with a cramp in my right foot then traveled up my leg through my spine and then down again to my balls. I exploded. The first shot was the best feeling I had ever had. Then her pussy clamped down harder and milked me. Extending my pleasure until she came with me. I pumped her full of seed and she shared her pleasure. 

My head hit the stone hard as I lost all my strength.

*Not bad for a first time, not bad at all.* 

Right. She had played me like a fiddle. Fuck. I was stuck here. 

*Do me like that again and I'll be satisfied enough to let you go home.* 

There was nothing I would rather do then take a shower and then cuddle down in bed but if this was the cost I could fuck a little, red demon once more. Really sacrifice myself.

***

I woke up with a stir. Something was wrong but nothing stood out. 

Someone banged on the front door. I checked my clock with panic in my throat. Had I overslept? No. It was four in the morning. Who the fuck came banging on my door at four in the morning? Maybe they would go away?

Another round of irritating bangs crushed that hope. Fuck. 

A round of excruciating pain traveled through me as I slithered out of bed and the bangs on the door made shooting pain travel around in my brain. I pushed the peephole open and an angry, little brunette stood on the other side. 

"Open up, asshole!"

What the fuck was Amber doing here? There was a click of the lock and the door flew up. 

"Hello, to you too." 

Two hands hit my chest and she pushed me into the wall. 

"I need to shower." 

She stormed past me, shedding her clothes on the way. Her perky boobs were straining against the black lace fabric of her bra. 

The bathroom door slammed closed and I stood there. Her bright pink bag stood out in the staircase. 

When I moved out to get it she yelled from the shower. "Don't touch it. I swear the hostel had fleas. I can feel them crawling on my skin. I'll take care of it later. Just go back to bed." 

How did she know exactly when I was about to pick up the bag? Was I really that predictable? Meh. I have a big exam tomorrow, I can't lose sleep over Amber and her kooky ideas.

*** Danny ***

There was hair in my mouth. Why was there hair in my mouth? Have I started to eat hair in my sleep? 

I pushed Amber away from me and she groaned. 

"We've talked about this, you're not allowed in my bed." My voice was hoarse and irritated.
