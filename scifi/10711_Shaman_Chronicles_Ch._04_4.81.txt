 Author's Note: Hello dear readers! I proudly present you the fourth installment of The "Shaman Chronicles". I just wanted to thank you for the awesome feedback you gave me on the third chapter, although I have to disappoint some of you right at the beginning. There will be no sex in this chapter and as you will see Jarko didn't summon a succubus. I am still thinking about adding a sexual component to this story, since I also get mixed signals from you . Also I want to apologize for how short the chapters are. Sadly I am really not able to make it longer due to the time I have not at my hands. Anyway I hope you'll enjoy reading this chapter. Again special thanks to A.L. If anybody criticizes my favorite editor again I am going to quit writing for sure :D

Sincerely WorldWarWalther.
