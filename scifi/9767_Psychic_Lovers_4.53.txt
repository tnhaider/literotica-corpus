 He woke up Monday feeling good. He had slept well and now she was giving him a hand job. And it was just the way he liked it - not too fast, not too hard. He just laid back enjoying the sensations wash over his cock. After a few minutes he realized something was wrong - there was no "she". He was alone. He didn't go out last night and there was no one in bed next to him.

He threw off the covers and saw his normal morning erection looking back at him. No one was touching him but he could feel a hand stroking him. He touched his cock. He could feel both his own hand and whatever was touching him. It wasn't stopping or even changing speed.

While in the shower he tried to jerk off, figuring that would make this stop but no matter what he did, he couldn't cum. Finally he gave up and went to work, his erection visible to all who looked. He got on the elevator, sweating, and an attractive young woman saw his erection. She blushed. The elevator door opened and she got off the elevator. He got off at the next floor.

He sat at his desk, trying to work but had trouble concentrating. The pressure never changed, the speed never changed, and, worst of all, he couldn't cum! But as lunchtime approached, he felt a change in his cock. The speed picked up just a little, and it felt like she was gripping him just a little tighter. After a few minutes, he realized he was finally going to orgasm, so he retreated to the bathroom. He locked himself in a stall, threw his head back and waited for what he hoped would be the inevitable. After several minutes, if felt as if she was stroking him faster and harder. He had to hold on to the walls to keep from falling. Finally, after five hours of being masturbated by an unseen entity, he came. After that, everything was back to normal.

He went to sleep that night wondering what had happened.

She woke up Monday feeling good. She had slept well and now she was giving him a hand job. She could tell it was just the way he liked it - not too fast, not too hard. She just kept going, knowing he was enjoying the sensations wash over his dick. After a few minutes she realized something was wrong - there was no "he". She was alone. She didn't go out last night and there was no one in bed next to her.

She looked at her hand. It was empty. But she could feel the dick as if she was touching it. She wiggled her fingers. She touched her hand to her face. Everything felt normal, but she could still feel that dick in her hand, throbbing. She was enjoying the feeling, but she couldn't figure what was happening.

Finally she went to work. On the elevator, she saw a young, handsome man with an erection. She wondered if guys were always erect and she never noticed until she imagined feeling a dick in her hand. She got off the elevator wondering why he had an erection.

The feeling didn't stop all morning. Around lunchtime, she could feel a change. It felt like she was going faster and gripping the dick tighter. It started throbbing harder and getting, well, it felt a little larger to her. And then, it started jerking for about 30 seconds and she realized the dick she imagined she was stroking had just cum. After that, everything was back to normal.

She went to sleep that night wondering what had happened.

***********************

She woke up Tuesday feeling good. She had slept well and now he was being her "right hand man", as Joan Osborne sings. He was rubbing her pussy just the way she liked it - fast and rough. She just laid back enjoying the sensations wash over her. He was rubbing her clit and then he would insert a finger or two into her. Then she realized she was still alone. There was no man next to her. "Crap", she thought. What the hell is going on with her? But she still just laid there, enjoying what she was feeling.

She never came close to orgasm, so she decided just to go to work and hope for the best. By the time she got to work, she was looking kind of disheveled. Her hair was slightly messy, her clothes weren't as neat as usual. She was having trouble concentrating.

Around lunchtime, the feelings were getting more intense. She could feel her orgasm getting closer. She went into the ladies room for some privacy, sat in a stall and closed her eyes. She was going to enjoy this, she decided. After about five minutes, she exploded. She did the best she could to keep quiet, but a few sounds did burst from her as her orgasm burst inside of her. After that, everything was back to normal.

She went to sleep that night wondering what was happening to her mind.

He woke up Tuesday feeling good. He had slept well and now he was being her "right hand man". He was rubbing her pussy just the way she liked it - fast and rough. He was rubbing her clit and then he would insert a finger or two into her. Then he realized he was still alone. There was no girl next to him. "Shit", he thought. What the hell is going on? He looked at his hand and he could feel her pussy. He could also feel his erection.

He decided to make the most of this. Using that same hand that was rubbing her pussy he started to masturbate. He only lasted about five minutes before he started to cum. But still the feeling of the pussy stayed with him. He decided just to go to work and hope for the best.

Around lunchtime, he could feel a change in her pussy. She was clenching around his fingers everytime he imagined he was entering her. Then, it felt like a vacuum cleaner was sucking on his fingers. He figured she had cum. After that, everything was back to normal.

********************

He woke up Wednesday feeling good. He was getting a blow job from this invisible woman. He wasn't going to move. He didn't want to scare her away, even though he knew she wasn't real. She was very good at this. She would lick his erect cock, and as she got closer to the end of his cock, she would lick in circles around the head of his cock. He was in heaven.

Then it dawned on him: How as he going to go to work with this happening to him? He struggled with the decision. He didn't want to call in sick. He didn't think he would be able to keep his voice calm enough with his cock getting licked like this. But if he was at work and he blew his load, would he be able to be silent as he came? He didn't want to have to explain to anyone what was happening. He could tell this was going to be a big orgasm. While he struggled with his decision, she kept on licking him, driving him wild.

He just laid back, five minutes, then 10 minutes. He decided he'd better go to work.

He sat at his desk, unable to think. He stared at his computer screen, avoiding eye contact with anyone. He was afraid to look at anyone for fear they'd see the pleasure on his face. He was slowly going insane. He laughed to himself at that thought - if an imaginary woman is giving him a blow job, isn't he already insane? The minutes ticked away slowly while he waited for lunch. He hoped lunchtime was the magic time for him to finally cum.

Noon, finally! He rushed into the mens' room, locked himself in a stall, and stuffed a handkerchief in his mouth. He wanted to be ready for whatever what about to happen. And, boy, did it happen! She started sucking, not just licking. Sucking, licking, licking, sucking. She was an expert at licking his cock-head. He was about to pass out from the pleasure she was giving him when it finally happened. He started to shoot. And shoot. He must have spurted for over a minute, or so it felt to him. She never stopped licking and sucking him for the entire time.

He was drained, both in his balls and in his spirit, when she finally finished blowing him. He could barely stand when he was done cleaning up the mess he had made. He went back to his desk and tried very hard to stay awake the rest of the day. When he got home, he fell right into bed and stayed there until morning.

********************

She woke up Wednesday feeling good. She was giving him a blow job. She could tell he was in heaven. She didn't want to stop, even though she knew he wasn't real. She could feel his dick throbbing in her mouth. She could tell that he thought she was very good at this. She would lick his erect cock, and as she got closer to the end of his cock, she would lick in circles around the head of his cock.

She held her hand to her mouth. There was nothing there, just as she knew there wouldn't be. She wondered what was going on, but she was actually enjoying the sensations she imagined she was feeling. She could feel his erect dick pulsing in her mouth, even while she was drinking coffee and eating breakfast. She figured, as long as she's imagining it, she might as well enjoy it!

She went to work, trying to concentrate on the feelings in her mouth. Her tongue felt like it was licking the head of the dick, and everytime is circled this dick, the dick would jump in her mouth. She hoped that someone, somewhere, was enjoying the other side of this as much as she was. She was not looking forward to lunchtime, the time she assumed this imaginary dick would come in her mouth. Not only did she not want it to come in her mouth, she didn't want to stop licking it.

Noon, finally! She could feel like she was now sucking, not just licking. Sucking, licking, licking, sucking. She felt as if she was an expert at licking his dick-head. It finally happened. He started to shoot. And shoot. He must have spurted for over a minute, or so it felt. She never stopped licking and sucking him for the entire time. She could feel the cum filling her mouth and dripping down her face, but when she touched her face there was nothing there.

She was a little disappointed when it stopped, and she wondered what was going to happen next. She was looking forward to getting a good licking from him, whomever he might be.

********************

She woke up Thursday, hoping to be pleasured the way she had pleasured him the day before. She was not disappointed. She could feel licking, sucking, even his tongue being inserted into her pussy. She was feeling great from this. He was an expert, she could tell. Of course, she figured he probably didn't exist, that it was her mind giving her this great licking, but who cares! She was just enjoying the pleasure, whatever the source.

Off she went to work, still feeling the invading tongue touching her everywhere. She sat at her desk, turned on her computer, and stared at it for the next 3 hours. She tried not to close her eyes as she enjoyed the licking. She watched the clock, anxious for lunchtime to arrive. Finally, she ran to the bathroom, locked herself in a stall and concentrated. Faster and faster the licking got. An occasional suck along with his tongue being inserted as far as possible helped her pleasure. And then, she could feel it starting. Her pussy contracted around his tongue and she could feel ripples of pleasure spreading out from her center. She bit her finger to stop herself from screaming. Too soon her orgasm stopped, but the licking didn't. She braced herself as she could feel another orgasm overtaking her. This one started in her toes and worked its way up her legs. When it reached her pussy she moaned, loud and long. Fortunately, no one was around to hear.

The rest of her day was uneventful. But she did smile for the rest of the day. She slept well that night, wondering what would happen on Friday.

********************

He woke up Thursday, wondering if he would be doing to her what she had done to him. He was not disappointed. He felt as if he was licking and sucking her pussy. He could even feel his tongue being inserted into her pussy. He could feel her pussy contracting around his tongue. Of course, he figured since she didn't exist, it was his mind making him think he was licking a pussy. But who cares! He was just enjoying the pleasure, whatever the source.

Off he went to work, still feeling his tongue touching her everywhere. He sat at his desk, turned on his computer, and stared at it for the next 3 hours. He enjoyed the licking. He watched the clock, waiting for lunchtime to arrive. Faster and faster the licking got. He felt an occasional suck along with his tongue being inserted as far as possible. And then, he could feel it starting. Her pussy contracted around his. Too soon her orgasm stopped, but the licking didn't. He could feel another orgasm overtaking her.

The rest of his day was uneventful.

********************

She woke up Friday, holding something. She had to figure it out since she couldn't see it. It felt long and narrow with an on/off switch. She flipped the switch and it started to vibrate. Ok, she thought, so that's what today's game is. She tried to move it with her hand, but all she could do was feel the vibrations. 

As she worked, she wondered if he could feel the vibrator. She figured she was crazy thinking about him, but she just knew he was real, somewhere. She imagined him sitting somewhere, eyes closed, head back, waiting for his orgasm. She got a little excited thinking about her imaginary friend. Then she felt the vibrator moving as if it were being pushed a little. She figured he must be getting close. It was almost lunchtime, so she knew what was about to happen. 

She felt the imaginary dick pulsing under the imaginary vibrator. She decided to time how long it lasted. For forty-five seconds she felt his dick pulsing and ejaculating. She hoped that whomever she was doing this to was enjoying it as much as she was. She couldn't wait for her turn tomorrow.

********************

He awoke with a start. Something was vibrating his cock. His already large morning erection was getting even larger from the sensations he imagined he was feeling. He didn't know how he would last until lunchtime. Jerking off didn't help, but he tried anyway. Resigned to his fate, he showered, tried jerking off again, ate breakfast, and went to work. He was, again, showing a rather large erection, and, again, tried to hide it but he couldn't. He sat at his desk, pretending to work, but all he could feel was the imaginary vibrator rubbing up and down his cock.

He could feel his erection pounding at the vibrations. He felt the vibrator rubbing the length of his cock, up and down. Around his cock head and down to his balls. He was having trouble breathing. He kept wiping his eyes. He ran to the bathroom just in time. He opened his pants, his cock jumped out, and started spurting. He closed his eyes and counted. For forty-five seconds he ejaculated. His orgasm felt like it reached down to his toes. He was spent.

He cleaned up the mess he made and wearily walked back to his desk. He tried very hard to stay awake. When he got home, he took a long hot shower and fell asleep on the couch.

********************

He woke up Saturday holding something. He had to figure it out since he couldn't see it. It felt long and narrow with an on/off switch. He assumed it was the vibrator that tortured him yesterday. He flipped the switch and it started to vibrate. Yup, he was right. It's a vibrator. He tried to move it with his hand, but all he could do was feel the vibrations. On any other day, he would have put his hand on his cock to see if he could feel the vibrations, but he was too spent from yesterday. He tried to go back to sleep, but the vibrator wouldn't let him. 

He got up, did his normal Saturday morning routine, and went out. He had a soccer game that morning. He was having trouble paying attention to the ball since he was thinking about his own balls. They were a little sore. He was also thinking about the girl, where ever she was, whomever she was. He could tell from the vibrations that he was entering her repeatedly and she was clutching the vibrator with her pussy. Of course, his team lost the game since his mind was elsewhere. 

Finally, it was lunchtime. He went back to his apartment, showered, and ate. Then his hand started to move, or so it felt to him. He could feel the vibrator increasing it's speed. He guessed she was about to orgasm. He would have liked to have been there for it, since he now had a huge hard-on. He imagined watching her as he rubbed the vibrator on her pussy. He started to stroke himself in rhythm to the vibrator he was imagining. He could feel himself about to cum when, suddenly, the vibrator hit full speed. He cursed as he ejaculated all over the floor. He had to clean that up. 

********************

She was ready. She was lying in bed, waiting, wondering when it was going to start. And then, boom! She felt the vibrator. She closed her eyes and held on to the bedsheets. It was heaven. She couldn't even think about him, she was just enjoying the sensations so much. She held her breath as the vibrator entered her. She could feel the pleasure overtaking her entire body. Her toenails could feel what was happening. She was having trouble remembering to breathe.

She never got out of bed. She didn't want to. She wanted to enjoy the feeling of the imaginary vibrator all day. But as the morning progressed, she could feel a change in the vibrator. It's speed increased and she could feel her toes curl. She imagined he was watching her as he rubbed her pussy. She imagined him stroking himself as he watched her. She closed her eyes, held her breath, and the vibrator hit full speed. She screamed in ecstacy. She was drenched in sweat. The sheets on her bed had come off. She fell asleep until dinnertime.

********************

Saturday night they had dinner. He took her to a nice restaurant. They sat in the back in a corner so they could have privacy. They talked for hours.

He was enthralled by her - she was beautiful and intelligent. She wore a royal blue dress that wrapped around her. When she sat, he could see her gorgeous legs. He could see her cleavage in that dress. He didn't know where to look. He decided to stare into her gorgeous brown eyes. He held her hand. He was fascinated by her. He told her about himself; she told him about herself. As they spoke, she put her hand on his knee. The longer they spoke, the closer her hand got to his cock. As he became erect, his cock reached her hand before her hand reached his cock. She started petting his cock. They kept talking and she kept stroking him. He couldn't take it anymore and started to cum. As he did, she kissed him.

He awoke groaning in the middle of cumming. He was throbbing and cumming in a big puddle. He couldn't breathe. As he regained his composure, he realized he couldn't remember her face or her voice. He had no clue what they spoke about. He remembered that dress and remembered her stroking him. He was happy for the dream but upset that he lost most of it.

Saturday night they had dinner. He took her to a nice restaurant. They sat in the back in a corner so they could have privacy. They talked for hours.

She had decided to buy a new dress for the occasion. She chose a royal blue dress that wrapped around. She could show off her legs and her cleavage in that dress. Also, it was easy to take off, just in case things got good.

She was entranced by him - he was handsome and charming. He held her hand. He gazed into her eyes. She was fascinated by him. She told him about herself; he told her about himself. As they spoke, he put his hand on her knee. The longer they spoke, the closer his hand got to her pussy. She spread her legs a little so he had a clear path to her center. They kept talking and he stroked her. She felt her release as he pushed his fingers into her. As she did, he kissed her.

She awoke in the middle of her orgasm. She couldn't breathe. As she regained her composure, she realized she couldn't remember his face or his voice. She had no clue what they spoke about. She remembered that dress and remembered him stroking her. She decided to buy that dress. Maybe the dress would bring her memories back.
