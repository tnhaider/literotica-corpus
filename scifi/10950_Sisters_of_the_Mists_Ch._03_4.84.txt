 Author's Notes:

This story is erotic fantasy, set in a world of magic. I reserve the right to be listed as the author of this work wherever it is posted. If found anywhere except Literotica.com with this note attached, this story is posted without my permission. Â© Darkniciad 2007

The villains in this story are truly evil, and their actions prove it. Some scenes may be disturbing for some readers.

I make use of modern weights and measures quite often in my work, because those are the weights and measures of my fantasy world. I know many fantasy readers prefer more archaic terms, and I hope those readers can overlook my use of miles, feet, and other such measures.

Please note that the form of witchcraft in my world is not meant to be true Wicca. Nor is it supposed to follow "Charmed" exactly. No offence or confusion is intended.

You should read the preceding chapters of this story in order to know the characters and what is going on. You will find that reading Book I of this story, Danica, will give you a lot of insight into the characters and the continuing storyline. For those who've already read Danica, welcome back to my world.

Relaxing next to the Pharaoh, trying to keep from dripping on the bed after enticing him to fill her upon awakening, Danica sat up and said, "I wanted to warn you about something."

The Pharaoh let out a questioning grunt, still too wrapped up in the aftermath of his climax to do more than that.

Danica continued, "The man you entered with last night, before my dance -- I know him. You shouldn't trust him. He works for someone who is trying to embroil the world in war, to distract them from some mad scheme of his own. He'll surely try to subvert people in your government, and likely already has."

That snapped Pharaoh out of his ecstatic fog. Sitting up, he asked, "What leads you to believe this?"

Danica sighed. "I can't explain, for my own safety and that of people I care about. Just be wary, and I'm sure you'll see things you've been missing. If you know what he's up to, things will likely stand out. That's why I came here, thinking to pass word through your sons to you."

Pharaoh's eyes narrowed. "Perhaps there is some truth in your words. Many of Clentamos' actions and suggestions are strange."

Danica smiled. "Just keep an eye on him -- that's all I ask. Anything that can interfere with whatever Zoraster was planning will help. I don't know what his actual goal was -- but knowing the man -- I know it had to be something that would be bad for anyone who didn't bow before him."

Sitting up and stretching, Danica said, "I should really be getting back. Your sons certainly inherited their skills from their father. It was wonderful."

A slight grin spread across Pharaoh's face, but it faded a moment later. "You have given me much to consider, and I shall do so." He once again smiled when he added, "I would be most pleased to have you dance for me again -- and share my bed."

Running her finger down the man's chest, Danica responded, "I have friends here in the city now. I'll probably be back for a visit or two."

"We shall await your return."

Danica kissed the Pharaoh's forehead, and then climbed out of bed in preparation to return to Harkhuf's house.

With everyone fed the morning meal, Andrea took her turn watching the girls for the morning. Celes and Marlena washed the dishes, with a lot of magical cheating on Celes' part, and then retired to the study.

Celes looked up from her mother's tome, shaking her head to clear it. For some reason, she couldn't get her mind to wrap around demons and rhymes today. Thinking she might need to take a break -- or perhaps find something in the Art to study instead, she glanced around and noticed Marlena absorbed in a spell book.

Walking over, Celes looked over Marlena's shoulder, seeing that the woman was studying the Permanency spell. When Marlena raised her head with a frustrated growl, Celes said, "Permanency? That's a difficult spell, and not something I'd expect you to be studying."

"I've been trying ever since I had my first dream here. I could cast this spell in it, and I hoped it might be prophetic. I'm not doing so well, though," Marlena explained, tugging at her red hair in irritation.

"You never mentioned that," Celes said. "Come to think of it -- that could be a perfect spell for you. A permanent illusion would be a useful thing sometimes, and yours would surely be magnificent."

"Flatterer," Marlena said sarcastically, but she blushed at the same time. She knew full well that Celes' praise of her ability to wield illusion magic was quite genuine.

Closing the book in front of Marlena, Celes said, "I need to take a break from witchery, and I think you need a break from this spell. How are you doing with learning some offensive spells? Have you managed the lightning bolt, yet?"

"Is witchery even a word?" Marlena asked with a cheeky smile.

"Don't change the subject," Celes scolded, slapping the woman playfully.

Marlena sighed, "Not yet. I feel like I'm so close, but I just can't get it."

Celes held up a finger to indicate that Marlena should wait, and then walked over to the bookshelf. Pulling down a volume she knew contained the lightning bolt spell, she brought it over to the table. Opening the book to the appropriate page, she sat it down in front of Marlena. "Okay, let me hear you say the words, and we'll see if that's it. There are a couple of inflections in this spell I've never heard you use in your magic."

Marlena spoke the words of the spell, making all the appropriate gestures, and Celes caught the mistake near the end of the spell immediately.

"It's that final syllable in the next to the last word," Celes said, pointing at the word in the book. "You're saying it a little too sharp. It should be more drawn out, almost like a little gasp -- with a little hissing quality to it." She then said the word with the proper inflection.

Marlena repeated it, and Celes said the word again. They continued in this fashion until Celes was satisfied that Marlena had the word pronounced perfectly. "Okay, now try the whole spell again."

Once again, Marlena spoke the words of the spell. When she reached the troublesome word this time, it glided from her lips perfectly. The redhead lurched, her eyes widening as she felt the tingle running through her body, signaling that the spell was hers.

Chuckling, Celes asked, "You have it, don't you?"

Marlena nodded, too excited about learning some truly offensive magic to give voice to her feelings.

Opening a nearby drawer, Celes withdrew a small amber rod and a patch of rabbit fur. Handing them to Marlena, she said, "Well, let's go outside then. I'm sure you want to try it out. We'll go over to the other side of the manor and I'll conjure up a spell siphon shield. That should handle a lightning bolt well enough, when I know what's coming. That way, Andrea can watch from the window. You'll probably have to do it again for Danica, though."

Standing up, Marlena paused before heading toward the door. She opened the first book, flipping back to the Permanency spell again. Pointing at one of the words, she asked Celes, "Is this the same inflection?"

Glancing down, Celes smiled and said, "Yes, it is."

"One step closer," Marlena announced, and closed the book.

A few minutes later, Marlena danced in the grass outside, having just cast her first lightning bolt. From behind her shield, Celes applauded, as did Andrea from a window of the manor.

In a nondescript grotto, deep within a windswept isle, the old Guardian repeated Marlena's earlier words as he watched Marlena dance in his mind's eye.

"One step closer."

Vellana looked up from her studies, saying, "Master?"

"Nothing, Vellana," Tam answered. "Where are you in your history lesson, my dear?"

"The fall of Brightwall, now known as Nightmare Castle," Vellana answered. "I still don't understand why it is important for me to read all this. Shouldn't I be spending more time learning magic, if I am to assist you in defending the stone?"

"Magic is powerful, but knowledge is the greatest weapon of all. Pay close attention to this part of your history lesson, as Nightmare Castle is a focal point of the here and now," Tam instructed.

"The Demon Lord?"

Nodding gravely, Tam said, "Yes, Meckataur. The stone will speak to you in your studies, as well. The knowledge may be locked away, revealed to you when the time is right, but everything you learn in the presence of the stone carries more weight than you know at the time."

"We will take time to study new spells today though, won't we?" Vellana looked up at the old man with a wistful expression.

Laughing, Tam patted her on the shoulder. "Yes, my dear, we will take time to study magic -- after you have finished reading your history."

Vellana smiled and returned to her reading. Tam closed his eyes, slipping back into his mental exploration of the world -- and the events rapidly unfolding.

Danica was nearly skipping as she walked from the litter into Harkhuf's home. She was sexually satisfied, and with Clexis' memory erased, Tari and Rekhmire were safe.

When she opened the door, Harkhuf turned to look at her and immediately chuckled. "You appear to be in high spirits."

Now, Danica did skip. When she reached Harkhuf, she kissed him on the cheek and said, "Well, I accomplished everything I set out to do. The Pharaoh has been warned -- personally -- and I got the opportunity to make sure that Tari and Rekhmire will go unnoticed here."

Rekhmire walked in to the room. "That is pleasing news. This house is in need of many things, and we will need to go to the market."

Harkhuf waved his hand to Rekhmire and said, "Come -- I will show you where I keep my coin and give you one of the key stones to unlock the strongbox. It should be enough to keep the house well-supplied for some time to come, but you need only send a message to the temple if the need for more arises."

Tari had entered right behind Rekhmire, and walked up to Danica while Harkhuf led Rekhmire out of the room. "This priest is much different than those I have known," Hathortari remarked. "He is kind, considerate, and does not look upon me like an animal."

"Harkhuf is a good man," Danica agreed. "I think you'll like it here, and you'll be safe now."

"You will be leaving soon, then?" Tari asked. Danica could see a touch of disappointment -- and desire -- in the beautiful woman's eyes.

Danica suppressed a shudder. "Maybe I'll stay another night," she said, twitching her eyebrows.

Color flooded Tari's cheeks, but she smiled back at Danica in a provocative manner and said, "I hoped you might."

"I think I'll check out the library here today, and perhaps do a little shopping while you and Rekhmire are out." Danica paused and added, "You were going with him, weren't you?"

"I would see this city. I find the display of wealth distasteful, but I am drawn to discover my new home."

"That will work perfectly. Then when we get back, we'll figure out something to do, to pass the time."

The two women shared a laugh as the men returned. Harkhuf and Rekhmire asked, of course, but Tari and Danica refused to say what they were talking about.

"You'll find out soon enough," Danica said with a toss of her hair. She laughed again, and then said, "I'm going to the library while they go shopping. I'll be back in a while, Harkhuf."

"I will accompany you. I need to speak with those here in the home temple," Harkhuf said.

Danica smiled and said, "Let's get going then."

Having placed Delilah in a high-class house of ill-repute -- one run by a madam under his control who had the wits to conceal the demon while educating her at the same time -- Ebonar arrived back at his complex with the second demon in tow. "You may choose to take your quarters here, within my inner sanctum, or live amongst the humans, to better study them, Thanatos."

"I will take quarters befitting any new apprentice," The dark-robed demon replied, his voice quiet and unremarkable.

This one is going to be cagey, Ebonar thought. He already seeks to be easily forgotten, and his features are commonplace. He will surely prove to be a dangerous foe -- or a valuable tool.

"As it pleases you, Thanatos. I will make the arrangements immediately. You will, of course, have complete access to the totality of the school library, as well as some unique magics only provided to a few -- when you are ready for them."

"You have females here?" Thanatos asked.

Ebonar chuckled. "Many -- and many more within my sphere of influence. Would you care to begin your education in that aspect of humanity now?" From his studies, he knew the demon's seed would be inviolate until it reached a higher level of maturity. Meckataur would have surely bound all his spawn with that restriction, in order to prevent them from breeding weak demons.

Throwing back his hood, revealing a mop of shoulder-length brown hair, Thanatos smiled. "Yes."

"I will fetch one immediately, then. You will find a room across the hall that should suit your needs. I will send the woman there. Do you have any special preference?"

"One that will teach me to please the females, that I may beguile them when they are most vulnerable," Thanatos replied.

"You learn quickly. I believe I know just the woman. Do try your best not to damage her in any permanent fashion, as she could serve you well for some time -- until you are ready to seek conquests of your own."

Thanatos nodded his understanding.

"I shall fetch her then, and leave directions to reach your new quarters within the school here.

Thanatos spun on his heel, heading toward the exit, and Ebonar vanished in a flash of light to bring the whore he had in mind for the demon.

Danica tucked a bundle of rolled parchments into her bag and left the library. She smiled sweetly at the man watching over the entrance, fighting off the urge to laugh at the priest. He had thought it unthinkable that she would be able to pass into the library, which was warded by the magic of a god. Little did he know that Danica had already been found worthy by Sekmamun, and could enter any such library whenever she wished. Even though she had spent two hours of exploring and copying spells, the man still stared at her with stunned disbelief.

When Danica reached a gallery near the entrance of the temple, she saw Harkhuf waiting for her. He intersected her path to walk with her out of the temple. "Were your studies fruitful?" He asked.

"Very," Danica replied. "I found one that is really intriguing, but it lists a spell component I've never heard of before. Do you know the spell Glasswall?"

"I believe I have seen it in the library, but have never taken the opportunity to study it."

"I'll show you the spell when we get back to your house. Maybe you'll recognize the component. I can think of some really useful applications for it." Danica shielded her eyes from the sun as they stepped outside the temple.

"I will be pleased to assist you," Harkhuf said with a slight bow.

They reached Harkhuf's house a few minutes later, and Danica withdrew her scrolls. Locating the identification mark of the scroll she wished Harkhuf to look at, Danica spread it out on a table. Harkhuf moved to stand next to her as Danica scanned down the lines of the scroll.

"There," she said and pointed. Do you have any idea what the secret well of life is?"

Harkhuf nodded and smiled. "It is a type of cactus that grows in the desert. It stores a great deal of water within, and thus may be used as a source of water where no other may be available. Few outside our land know this, and thus it is the secret well of life."

"Do you know where any are?" Danica asked.

"Of course. I will give you directions, and I will show you a place that I believe is unique enough to allow you to use it as a teleportation pattern. This place is very close to where some of the cacti grow."

"Thank you," Danica responded with a bright smile.

The door opened, heralding the return of Rekhmire and Hathortari. The sight of the couple also heralded the awakening of Danica's desire. Though Danica's goal was to learn to control those feelings, right now she saw no reason to. Tari had hinted she was hungry for Danica's touch, and Danica believed a little celebration was in order, considering she had accomplished all her goals here.

For the moment, she kept the bonfire within her contained. Tari and Rekhmire had numerous purchases to bring inside and put away. Once the work was done, it would be time for play. Moving toward the door, Danica went to help.

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****}

Having finished their evening meal, Danica and the others sat, sipping wine. Looking at Hathortari sitting across from her, the fires within Danica surged, refusing to be contained this time.

Danica kicked off her shoes, running her bare foot up Tari's leg. Tari gasped, trembling from the touch and causing the two men at the table to look at her with confusion. A moment later, they noticed Danica's sly smile, and then they understood.

Danica stood, walking around the table to kiss Tari's neck. Standing back up straight, she announced, "I think we might retire a bit early. We have a lot of catching up to do."

Blushing a little, Tari stood up -- embarrassment unable to overshadow her desire for Danica. Danica kissed the woman hungrily, and then took her hand, leading her toward the bedroom. As they walked, Danica looked back over her shoulder and asked, "Would you care to join us?"

Not waiting for an answer, Danica continued with Tari toward the bedroom Harkhuf had provided for the former slave's use. The sound of two chairs sliding away from the table behind her brought a smile to Danica's lips.

The two women fell into the bed together, their lips locked in a passionate kiss and their hands already roaming over each other's bodies. Those questing hands quickly worked at knots and fasteners, removing clothing that was in the way of their desires. When Danica felt the presence of the two men in the room, she made a gesture with both hands, indicating they should come to opposite sides of the bed.

Once Harkhuf and Rekhmire appeared in Danica's peripheral vision, as she suckled Tari's right nipple, she patted the bed, directing the men to sit. The final bits of concealing cloth vanished from the two women's bodies as the men followed Danica's direction.

Pushing gently on Rekhmire's hip, she instructed him to move toward the head of the bed. At the same time, she moved one of her knees between Tari's, and parted the dusky-skinned woman's legs. Tari's breathing quickened as Danica slid her hands over Tari's tummy, edging toward the woman's mound. At the same time, Danica slowly edged her knees backward, leaning down over Tari's sex.

Reaching up, Danica guided Tari's hand under Rekhmire's tented kilt and dropped down to taste the woman. Danica's hand slipped beneath Harkhuf's kilt as she teased Tari's folds with her tongue.

Hathortari rose quickly toward a peak on Danica's tongue, writhing beneath the redhead and erupting in a steady stream of sharp, high-pitched moans. Both women's hands continued to rasp over the men's erections, although a bit sporadically. They were too caught up in each other to coordinate the motion of their arms more than that.

Danica moaned into Tari's sex as the flow of the woman's spicy juices increased. Tari's hips rose up toward Danica's face, and Danica knew the dark-haired beauty was nearly there. Tari trembled, her hands moving to the back of Danica's head. A long cry of pleasure bubbled from Tari's lips -- turning sharp and loud as the first throes of orgasm gripped her.
