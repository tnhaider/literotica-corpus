 A broad, short, man and a lithe woman looked out over the crenellations at the near horizon. His clothing did not fit the time, made from animal pelts and coarse fabric, the vest and kilt would only fit among the reenactments. Even there it would look out of place among the Victorian attire. He was from a far older time.

His rough-made sword scraped halfway out of its scabbard before the woman's soft hand floated gently down to rest atop his and hold his action. He looked up quizzically. "But there is a man out there. He is on our lands. He seeks plunder like the dragon men once did."

The smile she returned relaxed the man slightly. Long dark hair seemed to float about her as she turned once more to face the distant threat. "Yes. But this man is not like the northmen. He is not a warrior. This is a task for me, not you."

Without further thought, the sword relaxed back into its home. With a grim nod the man turned and went back into the castle. The woman watched him go, but quickly returned her attention to the forest. She cared for the man but, like him, she had needs. The man felt the draw to combat, but she felt a very different pull. Hers came from much lower.

She could satisfy that urge and still beguile him away from their home. And if she could not, there might still be need of that sword.
