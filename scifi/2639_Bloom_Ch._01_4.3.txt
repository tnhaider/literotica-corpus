 Some of the native measurements in this story are not absolute. "Weighted three stones" or "walked five paces" would be good examples.

Some units, distances, and measurements of time have been annotated using the metric system for your own enjoyment. I apologise in advance if this ruins the immersion for some readers.

Tribal names are direct translations from Swahili. This means nothing as to the context or location of this story. I was merely looking for convincing tribal names, and could have used Maori or Native-American as well. Blame my lack of creativity in this regard!

Sexual content may or may not be forthcoming in this story. I don't plan this kind of thing in advance. If no such scenes are to be found by the end of it, please don't hold it against me. It stems from the mood and inspiration, and my inspiration is sporadic and unpredictable at times.

I certainly hope you enjoy this story, and as always, your feedback is always welcome. It can influence my writing as I publish new chapters! If I like an idea, I will incorporate it.

This will be posted in short chapters on this site, chapter by chapter, as soon as they are finished. Unlike my profession – software development for the curious – I've learnt that I write much better under the pressure and scrutiny of my readers' eyes.
