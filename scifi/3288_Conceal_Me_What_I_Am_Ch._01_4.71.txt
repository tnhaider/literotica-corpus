William Shakespeare(Twelfth Night, Act I, Scene 2) Author's Forward:

This is the third story in the Arc Deco series, and unlike the second story, I'm not going to back up as much to explain the weird and twisted world that Zak Zephyr lives in, so I'd suggest that you read those two stories first if you want to have a better idea of what is going on. This will be a long story, nearly novel length, so this should help satisfy the many readers that have been emailing me regularly for the last year, eagerly awaiting the next Zak adventure! Like this story, the next tale might be significantly delayed, so enjoy!

I'm slowly working on some large scale political maps of the Great Western Alliance, and its borders with Deseret, the CSA and the USA. Not to mention the western British Colonial Zone of Columbia and the very reduced frontier border with Mexico (or what's left of it). Maybe with luck I can get these done by the time the story has completed posting or shortly afterwards.
