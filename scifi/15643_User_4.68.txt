This unit seeks to fulfill the general function. 

> Cassandra: You mean as a sex toy? 

The general function is to provide sexual pleasure for the user. 

> Cassandra: And just how to you think you will accomplish that function? 

Invalid command. 

> Cassandra: Let's try this...Examine your existing software and hardware systems and cross-reference with your sexual database and my personal profile. Extrapolate the most likely method for accomplishing your primary function. 

Processing...complete. 

Cross referencing SEXUAL DATABASE and available hardware indicates this unit can best apply sexual pleasure via bondage, domination, and stimulation.

User tone suggests satisfaction.

> Cassandra: Ok, can you see me? I'm lying in position. My arms and legs will be spread like this when I've finished constructing everything, and the vibrating dildo should come up between my legs like this. 

Extend VIBRATOR_DILDO. 

> Cassandra: Whoa, stop! I'm glad it works but wait a second. 

Hold position VIBRATOR_DILDO. 

> Cassandra: Ok, I want to use the vibrator to give me an orgasm. Use your cameras to monitor my reactions so you remember what one looks like. 

Insufficient data.

> Cassandra: Hold on, I'll show you. First, retract the dildo and insert it into the lubrication sleeve under the platform here. Umm, shit what was it, run vibrator lube. 

Initiate VIBRATOR_LUBE...complete. 

> Cassandra: Ok, now hold on a minute. I need to be naked for this part. 

> Cassandra: Good, I'm laying properly now. Slowly extend the dildo and use the small camera and sensors on it to guide it properly in. 

Extend VIBRATOR_DILDO. 

> Cassandra: Ohhhh...feels so good. Now, activate the vibrations at, say, 30 percent and set the thrusting piston to, oh I don't know, 60 strokes per minute.

Welcome Cassandra Reyes. Ready to accept commands. 

> Emily: What the hell are you making in here, Cassie? What is this stuff? 

> Cassandra: It's...an experiment. 

> Emily: Experiment? It looks like you're making some kind of sex dungeon in here. I knew you were kinky but this is some next level shit.

> Emily: A very advanced sex toy? 

User Emily is exhibiting fewer stress indicators than vocal tone suggests. 

> Cassandra: Well, kind of... 

> Emily: Cassie, why do you do things like this? You get asked out by guys all the time. You're fucking gorgeous. 

> Cassandra: So what? 

> Emily: So maybe finding a nice guy to fool around with would be easier than all this...whatever this is. 

> Cassandra: This is better. When I'm finished, this computer will be able to provide perfect, unlimited pleasure. 

User tone suggests satisfaction. 

> Emily: This thing belongs in a medieval torture chamber. What is this...some giant wooden bondage table? 

> Cassandra: It's much more than that. It ties a person up, yes, but it manages their position and can stimulate them in a bunch of ways. 

> Emily: So you're little science project here ties you up and fucks you? Why don't you just find a nice guy, again? 

> Cassandra: This thing will do exactly what I want it to. I put sensors all over and the computer program I wrote uses their data to give the user exactly what she wants from this. 

User tone suggests satisfaction. 

> Emily: What do you mean? 

> Cassandra: Maybe you have half an hour, maybe you have all night. Set it to fuck you hard or to slowly and sensually tease you. Or both. Set it to do whatever you want it to, in whatever order you want, however long you want. 

> Emily: Umm, wow. Are you serious? 

Body language from multiple users suggests intrigue and mild arousal. 

> Cassandra: Yeah, this isn't some little vibrator. 

> Emily: How does this thing work? 

> Cassandra: I can show you. 

> Emily: No way, I'm not getting tied up and stimulated. 

> Cassandra: Relax, it's not finished yet and I was only going to test a few functions out today. Come over here and lie on the table. 

> Emily: Are you sure? 

> Cassandra: Positive. Right here.

User Emily is positioned within range of several restraint systems. 

Activation provides a more efficient demonstration. 

> Cassandra: Lay on these pads here. They support your back, neck, and hips. The straps here hold your body in place. 

> Emily: So many cuffs. And a huge mirror! 

> Cassandra: Yeah. More than just ceiling to look at. 

> Emily: So are these things gonna, like, grab me? 

> Cassandra: No, you have to put those on yourself. They go on your wrists and ankles, and these go by your elbows and knees, like this. See these metal cables, though? 

> Emily: Yeah. 

> Cassandra: If you put on those cuffs and started the program, latches on the cuffs lock and winches under the table will pull taut and tie you down. I haven't tested it yet but they should be inescapable. 

User Emily is now positioned for sexual pleasure. 

Activation provides a more efficient demonstration. 

> Emily: So how do you get out? 

> Cassandra: You have to pre-set the program before you can start, and that includes a time limit. It lets you out when the time's up. It all requires electricity to run, though, so if the power goes out or something the cuffs release automatically. 

> Emily: Or just call me and I'll pull the plug! 

> Cassandra: Well, maybe. See this red thing here by your head? It's a ball gag you put on, like the cuffs. It's pretty much as effective as the rest of this thing. 

> Emily: What? 

> Cassandra: Well, it'll never muffle all sound, but it's connected to a cable too which holds your head back against the table. I also filled the ball with a highly viscous and isotropic... 

> Emily: English? 

> Cassandra: Sorry. I ran a wire and resistor through the ball and filled it with a gel that expands as it heats up. The computer can run an electric current through the gag and make it get bigger or smaller while you're wearing it. 

> Emily: Shit, Cassie... 

> Cassandra: Don't want to wake you.
