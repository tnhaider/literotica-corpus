The villains in this story are truly evil, and their actions prove it. Some scenes may be disturbing for some readers.

I make use of modern weights and measures quite often in my work, because those are the weights and measures of my fantasy world. I know many fantasy readers prefer more archaic terms, and I hope those readers can overlook my use of miles, feet, and other such measures.

Please note that the form of witchcraft in my world is not meant to be true Wicca. Nor is it supposed to follow "Charmed" exactly. No offence or confusion is intended.

You should read the preceding chapters of this story in order to know the characters and what is going on. You will find that reading Book I of this story, Danica, will give you a lot of insight into the characters and the continuing storyline.

With breakfast finished and the girls washing dishes, Danica returned to the lab to add to her work on the model for Ashley's cottage. She knew that as soon as the girls finished with the washing that they would track her down to work on their toys. The first two clay phalluses had fired perfectly, and now sat on a shelf awaiting glazing. Danica had decided to let the girls each glaze their own toys, thinking that the unique touches would make the items more personal for the girls.

The cottages weren't nearly as sophisticated as the manor, and so Danica was almost done with Ashley's after only working on the model for about half a day. Both Edna and Ashley's cottages would have a magical tub and chamber pot identical to those in the manor, offering comfort without the need for maintenance. The storage spaces would also contain magical enhancements based upon the bag of holding, which allowed them to hold far more than physically possible.

Once combined with the individual furnishings and choices Celes had asked the two women to outline, the cottages would be comfortable, functional homes for both Ashley and Edna.

Glancing up to rest her eyes, Danica saw Ashley walk into the lab. Smiling at the red-haired witch, Danica said, "Yours is almost done. I should be able to finish Edna's soon as well. I want to make sure that both of you are comfortable, because I'm not sure how long it's going to last."

"You'll have whatever help you need from me in your battles. It's the least I can do to thank you for what you've done for me. If you're right, we're helping each other no matter which set of problems we attack." Walking over to the table where she'd been working of late, Ashley peeked down into her cauldron and said, "I may have the means right here to track down any demon that Meckataur commands, if the spell worked."

Putting down her tools, Danica stood and walked over to Ashley's chosen work area. "How do they work?" She asked, looking at the earth-colored little beads in the bottom of the pot.

Pulling out one of the beads, Ashley explained, "It's a little like scrying, except it's instantaneous and more or less untraceable. It happens so quickly that even if a demon notices it, they can't possibly track it back to the source. These can tell you the numbers, strength, and location of demons on a map at the moment they're used.

"Why don't we test them and my theories at the same time, then? I'll go find everyone, and we'll try them out on the area around Zoraster's complex."

"That will only tell us if Meckataur's demons are nearby -- not whether they're working together."

Danica shrugged her shoulders and said, "You never know. There may be clues that can tell us more, based upon where the demons are. I'll gather everyone up." Walking over to a shelf, she retrieved a map and handed it to Ashley. "I'll be right back."

A few minutes later, Danica returned with Andrea, Celes, and Marlena. Edna had chosen to remain with the girls to help reduce the damage to the dishes. With the map unrolled in front of her and ready, Ashley said, "Here goes," as soon as everyone reached the table.

Ashley tossed the pebble down at the map, creating a shower of deep purple sparks that cascaded upward in a fountain. When the sparkles settled back to the map, they coalesced into glowing points of red light.

Danica pointed at the largest, brightest spot on the map. "That's Zoraster's complex."

"And a very powerful demon," Ashley advised. "That is either a dangerous greater demon, a Devil that Meckataur has somehow subverted, or one of his spawn."

"There's no way that a demon could get into Zoraster's complex without someone knowing about it. They have to be working together," Celes declared.

"The rest of these dots are minor demons," Ashley said, as she looked at the dozen or so other points of light on the map.

"Three of those are in Montbank. I agree with Celes, they're working together. Even if they aren't, then they're using each other in some way and may as well be allied," Danica declared.

"So now we can track down the demons. What were you up to with those patterns, Danica?" Celes asked.

"The rune wands I gave Carolyn and Heather will let me find anything with that pattern on it instantly," Danica explained. "I told them to put the pattern on anything they made for someone who seemed suspicious. It's just a start, but I think we're going to have to mimic part of the way Zoraster operates. We need eyes everywhere."

"It all seems so hopeless," Marlena said with a sigh. "Zoraster, Meckataur, his spawn, the rift to the hells, armies preparing for war..."

"We do what we can," Danica said and smiled. She then twitched her eyebrows and said, "We've been in hopeless situations before. We're still here, so we must be doing something right."

"And we're all a damn sight stronger now than we were then, too," Celes added.

Hearing the sound of the girls approaching the lab, Danica chuckled and said, "For now, I think I know what I need to do, if we ever want any peace." Putting aside her model, she picked up the satchels of clay beneath the table as the girls filed into the lab.

Having wrung every ounce of information and exquisite agony possible from the woman, Thanatos at last unleashed his deadly touch. The witch died almost soundlessly, only a sigh caused by her last, shallow breath escaping her broke the silence.

An unearthly growl of triumph rumbled from within Thanatos as the demon felt the witch's powers swell within him. Though minor powers suited only for stealth and trickery, the abilities would serve him well.

The woman revealed tantalizing hints of what Ebonar truly sought, as well as the source of power that had allowed the witch's Master to break free of Meckataur's control. Already attuned to magic from birth, Thanatos knew that there was no need to report his discoveries to Ebonar. The man's magic in the room served that purpose well.

His Sire, however, was an entirely different matter. As if a subtle flavoring, Thanatos could feel intriguing touches of something in the witch's power -- something significant. Meckataur would certainly demand to taste this power, and Thanatos was far from foolish enough to risk his Sire's ire -- for now.

In a crackle of flame, Thanatos vanished from the cell.

Even as the flames died down, a flash of light revealed Ebonar in the demon's place. In the space of a single heartbeat, both Ebonar and the corpse of the witch vanished from the cell.

Upon appearing in his inner sanctum, Ebonar called up his powers, causing the woman's corpse to rise from the floor. Directing the magic, Ebonar caused the woman's limp body to float toward a sphere of magical energy housing a spot of black.

As the corpse neared the sphere, Ebonar let out a sigh of knowing satisfaction. His plan to force the woman into the Devil's hands now bore fruit. Within the sphere, the jet-black chip of skull-shaped stone vibrated violently -- the energy growing stronger as the witch's corpse moved closer.

The ebon skull only reacted so to a very specific sort of power, the same power housed within Godsbane.

As he and his Master suspected, the Devil Tanarax had a connection with the power that Zoraster sought.

Edna stepped into the lab and announced, "Supper is ready. Wash up and come along, girls."

The clones erupted in a chorus of, "Yes, Gran," reluctantly leaving their work to prepare for supper.

Danica sat back in her chair with a sigh. "Four more. Only five to go. It's nice to have the extra help so that we don't all have to spend half the day in the kitchen like we used to."

Edna walked over to the table, examining the clay cocks there with an amused grin. "Give them a little more time and we can put them to work in the kitchen. Considering how your six seem to share most of your talents, they'll likely have your cooking skills as well, once taught."

Danica laughed, memories of her mother coming back to her. "Mom used to joke about that being the main reason to have children -- to do all the work."

Edna shook her head and chuckled. "Come along, now. You need to wash up and come to supper too."

"Yes, Gran," Danica responded with a wink as she stood up from her chair.

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****}

"I haven't heard the sound of a single dish breaking," Andrea remarked as she sat with her friends at the table after supper.

"Well, damn me -- you're right," Celes remarked with an amused snort. "If this keeps up, we'll be able to devote more time to our studies, and the work certainly seems to be doing them good." Tapping the table with her hand, she said, "Ashley thinks we should try to capture one of the minor demons," continuing the conversation Andrea had interrupted with her observance.

"We might be able to learn more about the rift, Meckataur, and the more powerful demons if we poke one enough," Ashley clarified.

"It sounds like a good idea to me," Danica agreed. "I haven't studied rifts much, but I know that a wide-open doorway to hell can't be a good thing."

"So we're off on a hunt tomorrow," Celes said with a wicked grin.

"Do you think your sister might be willing to teach me some of her original spells?" Marlena asked Danica. "The ones you've talked about are fascinating, and I think they might work with some ideas I have."

Danica smiled and said, "I'm sure she will." Her brow furrowed a second later as she considered the need to take Marlena to Devan's tower. "Hmm, I think I need to add some teleportation items to my list of things to make. I need to spend a few days with my bottom in a chair if I'm ever going to catch up."

Ashley tapped her finger on the table a few times and then said, "We still need to come up with a spell to contain a demon. Our books mostly deal with finding and destroying them. That will take a few days."

"I'll take Marlena to see Devan," Celes offered. "Just tell her that we're coming and teach me her pattern."

"And I'll chain myself to my table in the lab," Danica chuckled.

Edna walked back in from checking on the girls and said, "Soon, I should imagine. The girls are nearly done with the dishes."

"We all have work to do then, because Devan is going to want to see your original spells, too," Danica said to Marlena as she stood. "If anyone has remedies for aching eyes, fingers, and a sore bottom, be sure to let me know."

Celes leaned over to look at Danica's backside with a twitch of her eyebrows and a crooked grin.

Before Celes could say anything, Danica cut her off with a laugh and said, "Behave."

Shortly thereafter, the girls emerged to sweep Danica into the lab with a chorus of giggles.

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****}

Though only a few structures were complete, Zoraster could already feel the power of the invisible rune tattoos on his flesh. Once covered in runes of protection and power, his body would be a living weapon -- as Danica had well evidenced.

Watching in his magic mirror, the Archmage admitted a rare feeling of surprise. The goblin dupe provided by his agent proved to very much have the ear of the goblin king. The cunning goblin, a rarity for the breed, whispered dreams of power into the ear of the equally cunning king. The first to reach the upper levels of goblin hierarchy in many years with such intelligence and ambition, he was easily influenced to seek the reclamation of his race's golden age.

Zoraster himself had participated in the battles to purge Normandal of the goblins that had overrun the castles and towns of the small nation some years before. For a few years, the goblin race had garnered more respect than any time in recorded history, repelling every assault upon their captured homeland with ferocious efficiency.

Led by Thakkor's formidable band, the hastily assembled army of Normandic patriots had managed to do what strike forces from both Egoria and Freeland had been unable to accomplish, striking to the heart of the goblin hordes through stealth and skill. Surgical strikes at the goblin leadership, culminating in the death of the then goblin king, caused the tribes to war with each other, allowing the citizen army to sweep the monsters from the borders.

A similar assault could likewise work against the humans now holding those lands, if Normandal was forced to stand alone.

Zoraster knew that so long as Thakkorias ruled Egoria and drew breath, Normandal would not stand alone against the goblin host.

"Run to the rescue, noble Thakkorias. That which is your greatest strength is also your greatest weakness."

Andrea waited outside as the girls followed Edna to their wing of the manor. Considering how excited the clones appeared, Andrea doubted that the older witch would have an easy time putting the girls to bed tonight. A sigh and a roll of Edna's eyes as the woman passed brought a smile to Andrea's lips, and revealed that Edna was hardly unaware of the girls' condition.

Finally able to get through, Andrea walked over to Danica at her worktable. Danica sat slumped back in her chair, tired but obviously satisfied.

"Done -- believe it or not," Danica announced as her blonde friend approached. "The girls helped a lot. I'm going to let them each glaze their own however they want to. They shouldn't be able to mix them up then."

Eyeing the large toy designed for Damika with a mixture of curiosity and apprehension, Andrea said, "I don't think that one is going to be difficult to pick out."

"Tempting and frightening at the same time, isn't it?" Danica asked, while running her finger along the flared tip of the toy cock.

Andrea shivered and hugged her arms around her. "More frightening than tempting, but yes." After a moment, she asked, "Do you feel odd?"

Danica shrugged her shoulders and then stood to pick up the large toy. As she transported the clay cock to the kiln, she answered, "Tired -- but I don't feel anything unusual."

"I feel nervous -- anxious. It's a little like when we met Alicia and the others on Darkni's island the first time. It feels like something important is happening."

Returning for two more of the newly completed toys, Danica noticed a glint of light from the medallion around Andrea's neck. After watching for a breath, she saw a similar wink of light. "Your amulet is glowing a little. Does that mean anything that you know of?"

Andrea looked down and noticed a sparkle of light, just as Danica had. After a bit of contemplation, she said, "It does feel a little like someone else's anxiety, and the feeling is stronger when I look at my amulet."

Danica picked up the two toys from the table and said, "I hope that's just a coincidence. I don't even want to consider that the gods are feeling anxious, and that you're feeling it coming from the Earth Mother through your amulet."

Andrea nodded her head in agreement and picked up the other two finished toys. "I hope so too. I'll help you put these in the kiln."

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****}

Floating in the central pool of her realm, Gaeaye indeed felt anxious. Nestled in the heart of her power, she leant her strength to that of the other gods of light. Left unchecked, the rift to the hells would only widen. The dark gods sensed the threat, but as many sought to exploit the results as to prevent them. Thus, with the quiet aid of the Mistress of the elves, the gods of light turned their power to a momentous task.

The Devil resisted with frightening strength, resulting in the anxiety of the gods. The power of the hells worked through Meckataur, granting the Devil unholy strength that would have torn any normal being apart.

Gaeaye felt a surge of strength, and instantly recognized the source. Elves throughout the world offered dual prayers to their Mistress and the Earth Mother, granting them both strength. Peoples of the plains sensed the wrongness in the world and sent their prayers heavenward as well.

The infusion of strength, both small and profound at the same time, lifted the Earth Mother's spirits, and her very body. Rising up from the water, she hovered with only her toes touching the surface and rivulets of water cascading down her nude form. The wind kissed her, whipping her wealth of dark hair like a banner in a spring breeze. In her surge of hope, the other gods found similar strength.

One instant, the hells held firm, and in the next, the damage was contained. Gaeaye sank back into the water of her pool, knowing that the danger was past -- for now.

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****}

Meckataur's roar of frustration caused rockslides in the underworld for dozens of miles around Nightmare castle. The pounding of the Devil's fists upon the stone left a spider web of cracks surrounding the deep indent upon the surface of the floor.

Gathering his strength, the Devil rose to his massive legs once more. The rift stood open still, but weakened. Though angry beyond mortal measure, Meckataur took twisted solace in knowing that the next such attempt would prove far more difficult for those arrayed against him. Already, the strands of power closing much of the wound in reality weakened. Soon, those threads would fray.

In the meantime, power and demons would continue to come to his call. Even as he grew stronger, so would the rift grow stronger upon the anchor of his being.

In time, even the gods would be powerless to stop him.

"Sire," Thanatos said to announce his presence.

Meckataur turned upon his spawn, sensing something new coursing through the core of Thanatos' powers. Thrusting his power into the smaller Devil, Meckataur tasted the same faint, unique flavoring. Unlike Thanatos, the greater Devil recognized the source of that power. "You have done well. Speak," Meckataur commanded, drool dripping from the hellspawn's fangs in anticipation.

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****} 

Danica looked up from her work to shake her head and quietly chuckle. All around her, the girls happily worked to glaze their toys, eagerly anticipating the magic that would bring them to life. The color schemes ranged from the realistic to the rainbow-colored.

With the girls busy, Danica had plenty of time to chat with Edna while she worked on the model that would become Ashley's cottage. The elder witch had pointedly told the three younger witches that they should work on their chosen endeavor together, without her guidance. I'll not be here to lead you around forever. The craft is within all of you. Let the magic speak to you, she'd said before sitting down to enjoy a long chat with Danica.

Much of the conversation between Danica and Edna took place silently, both women so comfortable with their mental powers that it took less energy and concentration to speak that way than to actually form the words. Edna reminded Danica much of her mother, which lightened her spirits. Once, such a reminder would have proved painful, but after seeing her mother and knowing that all was well, Danica was glad for the nostalgia in Edna's manner.
