 Crouching on the roof of the building, she overlooked the boardwalk where unsuspecting humans were offering them selves up as food; to vampires. She knows this, she kills them, nightly. Sheyenne had hunted for as long as she could remember. Her mother and grandmother were hunters before her. They taught her all the tricks they knew, and she improved on a few. 

Her latest prey was Blake. He was the oldest she had ever hunted, 750 years old. Being that old meant he had almost reached, or had reached, his full powers. She hunted him because he had killed her mother, and for that he would suffer. Not die, suffer; for a long time. After watching him kill her mother, she vowed to hunt him down. She trained for months, stopping only to eat and rest, perfecting each move until she could do them in her sleep.

Caught up in her thoughts, she almost missed him, walking around by the fountain. She studied him, although she could never forget him if she tried. He was tall, almost 6 feet judging by the height of the water shooting up in rhythm to the music. His golden hair spilled around his face like a curtain, a short one because his hair only reached his shoulders. His eyes were ice blue, so pale, so haunting. He was built like a hunter, long lean legs, strong shoulders, wide chest...WAIT, what was she thinking, she didn't need to think of her prey that way. 

~~"~~

He knew she was there, he came for her specifically. From his position, he could just make her out on the roof. He was hunting her hunting him. He had made it a game; she just didn't know it, yet. He had studied her while she had trained to kill him. She was short, only reaching 5'2 or so. Her black hair was waist length and her green eyes would make trees envious because they were so bright. She had a gymnast build from hours of tumbling and bars training. He had chosen this location for the confrontation because she couldn't cause a big scene, and that would get her goat.

~~"~~

She had descended off the roof and was making her way to the fountain when he turned around and looked her straight in the eyes. She knew it was coming but still her breath caught in her throat at the intensity in his eyes. "So you knew I would be here?"

"I had a feeling, besides I wasn't hunting for anyone but you." Blake said, moving closer to her, like a panther stalking its next meal.

"Hunting for me? Why would you do that? I should be the one kil . . looking for you." Damn, she almost said that out loud. It would do no good for one of these humans to hear her threaten to kill someone. "We should take this somewhere more, private." 

"You are right, we should take this somewhere else, but not tonight." With that he turned and strolled off in the crowed. She could have cussed a stream of words that would have made a sailor blush, but stopped because there were others around here. There would be other nights; she would start preparing, now.

~~"~~

He was pissed, beyond pissed, livid was more like it. He picked up the closest thing he could get his hands on and threw it against the far wall. Damn he thought, there went my favorite vase. He paced the floor of his living room, scheming for the next time they would meet.

~~"~~

Sheyenne knew that the next time would be either his or hers last time to see the earth, alive. She knew he would plan something to kill her off. She just had to plan something better. Thinking of how to pull it off, she walked into her apartment and never noticed the figure in the corner. She took off her jacket and hung it over the chair, then unzipped her boots and threw them in the hall closet. Her shirt was next, left outside the bathroom door. Finally, her pants and undergarments before stepping in the shower. The hot water helped clear her head for the planning of a murder. But it wasn't really a murder if the person was already dead. You can't kill someone twice. 

After cleaning and drying off, she walked to her bedroom without a towel, who would care? It was her place anyway. Rummaging through her closet for a shirt, she was taken off guard by someone grabbing her from behind, wrapping one hand around her waist and the other over her mouth. She struggled, hoping to wiggle out, but the arms were strong, too strong. She stopped moving and started thinking. "How does it feel now love?" She knew that voice! Blake! Dammit, what would she do now? "How does it feel to be helpless, alone, naked?" With the last word, the arm around her waist moved up to cup her breast. He played with her nipple, rolling it between his fingers and pulling on it until it was a hard pebble in his hand. "Oh, you are turned on aren't you?"

He moved his hand back down to her waist and removed the other from her mouth. "I am not turned on by you; it is an involuntary reflex by the body brought on by cold air and outside stimulation." She told him. "And if you think I won't kill you for this, you are wrong." She spat out. 

"Angry much?"

"Only when you're around" she said "and then I have to try not to throw up on you because you make me sick." With that she tried moving again but only succeeded in wiggling her hips against his.

He groaned and she stopped moving. "Dear, if you keep that up I may have to change my mind about what I do with you." He said through clenched teeth.

She got an idea then. She knew what to do to get him off guard. "Would you really?" she asked while rotating her hips and grinding them against his. She felt him grow large against her backside. She could only imagine what it would feel like pounding away . . . DAMN, stop that! She thought to herself. She needed to focus on the task at hand. "Maybe we could work something out. Come to some, agreement, which would benefit us both." And with that she leaned back into his chest and stuck her chest out, as if offering him her breasts. 

~~"~~

He knew that he should leave, he shouldn't be here doing this. He knew he should go ahead and kill her. She was not supposed to do this, she should fight, struggle, cry even. Not give up this easily. But he was never one to look a gift horse in the mouth. The hand that was on her mouth reached up and grabbed her hair, pulling her head back against his shoulder. He looked into her eyes, seeing nothing malicious in them. He kissed her, full on the mouth. His tongue scrapped against her lips, asking for permission to enter. When she finally gave in, he knew he was lost; there would be no other night like this. The hand around her waist moved lower on her abdomen, circling her bellybutton. 

~~"~~

She knew she was in trouble when he kissed her. Her stomach was in knots by the time his hand made it to her bellybutton. She was sure he would continue his trip south, and sure enough his hand moved lower to cup her. He massaged her and she moaned and pushed herself into his hand. His fingers parted her outer lips and his index finger found her clit, slowly rubbing it. Her legs nearly buckled and she would have fallen but for his grip on her hair. By now he had moved his lips from hers and moved down to her neck. His teeth gently scraped her neck and she moaned louder.

~~"~~

He could feel her wetness; she was very much in tune with his desires. The hand that was on her hair let go and reached around to hold her breast. He was having a hard time keeping up with both hands and his mouth because he was trying not to bite her, and he didn't want that. So instead of risking it he turned her around to face him. He placed his hands on her hips and looked into her eyes. "You know what I want, don't you?" he asked her. "I don't want your life, well; at least, I don't want you dead." He chuckled at his own joke. 

~~"~~

She moved her now free arms to his shoulders and pushed, hard. She watched him stumble backwards, trying to catch himself, then fall on the floor, landing on his nice little butt. She snickered, which earned an evil glare from him. "Oh come on, you should have know it wouldn't be so easy to get in my pants." She said, her hands now on her hips. "And if you know what's good for you, you will leave now before I kick your ass."

"You are kidding right? I mean, I am the one dressed here." He stated while standing up. "You have nothing on you except, well, nothing. Oh, and I like it that way, too."

"Kiss my ass." She flipped him off.

"Any day sweetheart." He said blowing her kisses. "Now are we done trying to kill each other tonight so we can get on with other business?"

"Can I get dressed please?" she asked. She was starting to get a little uncomfortable under his gaze. He looked at her like she was a prime cut of meat, and he was the lion. Even though it bothered her a bit, it was also making her hot as hell. 

"No, it will come right back off." He smirked. He could smell her arousal. He stalked toward her, know what would come next.

She was shocked at how forward he was being tonight. She backed up until the wall was at her back, and it was cold. Her nipples hardened instantly. She felt around form something grab a hold of, anything to keep him at bay. Nothing, there was nothing. He had managed to back her against the only portion of wall with nothing on it. Damn. "Stop." She said, holding her hands out in front of her. "We can't do this anymore. I am supposed to hate you remember? You killed my family."

"You may hate what I did, but you don't hate me." He said, walking up to her and putting a hand on either side of her head. "Deep down you have forgiven me of all my past crimes, why else would you let me do what I have been doing to you?" he asked, raising and eyebrow and smirking.

She hated when he did that, he was too sexy for his own good. She lowered her head and sighed. She had forgiven him, but why let him no that? She raised her head back up and smiled evilly at him. She had a look in her eyes that reminded him of a predator stalking their prey. She pushed off the wall and wrapped her arms around his neck, pulling his head down for a kiss. She lightly placed her lips on his and licked his bottom lip. He groaned and opened his mouth to capture hers. She met his kiss head on. Their tongues met and it was electric. That's all she could think. Something shot from her mouth to her feet and back again. 

~~"~~

Damn what this woman could do to him, he hated and loved it at the same time.
