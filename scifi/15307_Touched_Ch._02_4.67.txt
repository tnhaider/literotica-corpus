 Although nearly every unoccupied moment was consumed with thoughts of Grant, after our last encounter I couldn't bring myself to contact him, even after he left two messages on my communicator. 

I couldn't trust myself to be around him. My desires overwhelmed me, the urge to touch him too strong.

For days, upon waking in the morning and before falling to sleep, I brought myself to release, his likeness burned into my mind. One night I discovered that if I kept going, it was possible to crest again and again, until I was too sensitive to continue. Never had I been so obsessed with my own body.

At work I grew absentminded, irritating Oliver more than ever. "You're not paid to daydream," he snapped one day after I was forced to call him because I had forgotten what errand he wanted me to run.

My friends noticed the change in me as well.

"I think you need to see a doctor," Xen insisted. "I know I would be a wreck if I had been trapped in a lift with a stranger."

Errol agreed. "You've been...off balance ever since your emergence day."

Even as I promised my supervisor that I would pull it together and assured my friends all was well, I knew I was anything but fine. Before long, even sleep offered little reprieve as Grant crept into my dreams. I feared I was losing my mind, and nearly contacted Amelia out of desperation. 

But what, exactly, was I going to tell the woman who raised me? That she had been right about me all along, that my refusal to stop touching everything barehanded all these years had transformed into a full-blown obsession? That I was consumed by a terrifying compulsion to touch a man I barely knew, to press my naked skin against his?

I could speak of it to no one. Growing up I heard whispers of defectives disappearing and never coming back. I didn't know what might happen to me if I were exposed, and I didn't want to find out.
