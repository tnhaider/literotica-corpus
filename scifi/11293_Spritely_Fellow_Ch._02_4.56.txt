 Hello all,

I have a small confession to make. I don't have a single clue where this story is going. I have a lot of ideas that I'm weaving into this, but for the most part it's just flowing out. If anything comes across as unclear, especially in sequences involving Mykris' power, tell me. Also I'm waiting for him to be older before he starts seeing things as an adult, so no sex for a while. Hang in there! Comments of all kinds are greatly appreciated. Thanks and enjoy.
