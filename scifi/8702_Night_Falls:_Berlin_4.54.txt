 Foreword:

This is another repost, and the companion piece to "Night Falls: Whitechapel", which I recommend reading first. Like that one, this is pretty historically accurate, and is my spin on what happened during the last days of the war in Europe as the allies closed in on Berlin and Hitler's bunker. This is purely a piece of historical fantasy, and is not to be taken too seriously, kind of like "Inglourious Basterds". Just fair warning. Lol

And as always, I hope everyone enjoys the ride. :)

I.D.
