 Sorry about the delay. Hope to have the next chapter posted in next couple of days. All feedback is welcome.

When Kat woke up the next morning, she saw that Charlie was already up and tending the fire that he had started the night before. The tantalizing smell of fresh brewed coffee was carried to her on the wind.  Sitting up, she slowly rubbed the sleep out of her eyes.  

"Good, you're up. We can get an early start today," he said as he handed her a cup of coffee. Kat smiled in thanks and took a sip of the hot brew.  She winced as it's bitter flavor coated her tongue. 

"Just out of curiosity, Charlie, how many packets of coffee did you use to make this?" 

"Three." He walked back over to the fire and poured himself a cup. He took a sip of it before spitting it out. "Yuk! What's wrong with the coffee that you brought?" 

"Nothing, Charlie. You just simply put to much in the pot."

"It said three on the packet."

"Three scoops, not three packets," she said as she stood and walked over to the fire. Dumping her coffee on the fire, she stretched and headed towards the zephti. Laying a reassuring hand on it's back, she softly rubbed it. The animal leaned towards her as she scratched it's favorite spot. 

Behind her, Charlie scowled and dumped the pot over the fire. Grabbing his pack he found a couple of nutrition bars. Tearing one of them open, he took a big bite out of it. 

"Here." He handed the other bar to her.

"What's this?" Kat asked as she accepted the bar.

"Breakfast." He turned back and started gathering up their bedrolls. 

"Wonderful!", Kat mumbled as she took a bite out of it. It tasted like cardboard. And she had a feeling it was going to be a long time until lunch.
