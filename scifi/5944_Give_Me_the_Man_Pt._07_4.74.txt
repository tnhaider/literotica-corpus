 My apologies for the long delay - like six years! - in posting this next part of the 'Give me the Man' opus, but I'm afraid I've had serious health problems which, for quite some time caused me to reappraise things, and I just haven't been writing. I've decided however that an hour or so of creativity every now and then can only be a Good Thing so I've been rummaging around amongst my unfinished pieces. And there are just too darned many of those! However, I managed to get this part completed, so here it is! There's a lot more of the story to tell, but I'll try to keep plugging on. Don't hold your breath!
