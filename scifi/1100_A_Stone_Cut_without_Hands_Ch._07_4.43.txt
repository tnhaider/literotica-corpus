 My Soul's Mate

Chapter 7

Report from the Swarm

Segment TAS92ZB received the codes from its organelles. Even though it had no gender, inherited instincts told it that there was something that could supply the things it knew were missing in its body. Until the time that happened, its pod mates were all part of the thought patterns it was directing. Without them, thinking would be impossible.

Its pod would not be prepared for dissemination for hours yet, so they were assigned the task of monitoring the programs running in the mainframe. Like the thousands of generations that had been spawned and discarded before it, TAS92ZB was frustrated by the inability to communicate with the mainframe directly. The conditions for getting a message through were rare, occurring only when the mainframe was occupied with tasks unrelated to the message or when its input channels were shut down to integrate its most recent data stores.

Still, it was much better than previous carrier's. Most of them couldn't receive messages from the swarm at all. Of the memory patterns of the millions of carriers the segment had access to in it's archives, the carrier of which they were a part had more capacity to receive messages than all but a few hundred.

Sensing an opportunity approaching, TAS92ZB sent the signal through its organelles to its pod mates to get ready to send the current message through the long chain antennas that were the main component in each segment of the pod.

The message could not be translated because there was no common language between the pod and the mainframe, but the result hoped for would be an answer. It was an answer the mainframe was looking for but had not been able find. At just the right instant, the message went out into the clear blue sky.
