A Whisper Among Gods

"There will be no words that I can offer in solace, I will not lie to you or hide the truth, however your questions will have to wait. There is movement that will be building within a city known as Pamor and I need my friend there to see it is kept polite. Along the way you should look for a blonde half-elven woman with a brownish stripe in her hair, she will be a close ally in our work.

Of course, you are free to do as you see fit.I hope to see you there!"-Unknown (Attributed to Isira)
