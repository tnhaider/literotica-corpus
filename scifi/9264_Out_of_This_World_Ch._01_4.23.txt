Nicholas and Shayna Castillo

10, September 5018, 7:00 AM

Monday

Lincoln, Nebraska

Fire Drive, Castillo Residence

Nicholas Castillo slept soundly beside his wife, Shayna Castillo who was a mariner woman. Nicholas was a 5 ft 8 man of Mexican-European descent. His father was Mexican while his mother was a white Englishwoman. A light complexion passed on to him from his mother. And instead of dark brown hair like his father, Nicholas's hair was light brown, that was a mixture of his mother's blonde and his father's dark brown hair. At only 27 years old, Nicholas had been married to his mariner wife for seven years, who blessed them with six children in total. Nicholas turned to her side to side to grab and spoon his wife. But something at the edge of his bed behind him, tugged on his shirt. Nicholas shook off the tugging and refocused on going back to sleep. But the tugging was incessant, and wasn't stopping. Nicholas opened his eyes and smiled at himself. He turned around on his side to see who was messing with him. 

A small child with a head full of light brown hair like his, light brown skin like his and a pair of large slanted eyes of her mother with pink irises, had been staring back at him. She ducked just below the edge of the bed to hide from her father's stare. Nicholas kept staring at the same spot and watched and waited for his youngest daughter, "Fukayna" to poke her head out again. This time Nicholas reached over and grabbed her and picked her up. She giggled and laughed as Nicholas lifted her up and down by her armpits. 

"What are you doing inside of mommy and daddy's bedroom, Fukayna, Huh?" He asked her softly and curiously.

"I don't want to go to school today, papa." Fukayna answered him, enunciating 'papa' in Spanish.

"Oh baby you have to go. If I let you stay home, your brothers and sister are also going to want to stay home, okay mija? Go get ready for school" Nicholas said, placing her back down on the floor and lightly tapping her on her butt and watched her walk out of his room. 

Nicholas went over and closed his bedroom door and locked it. He then turned to look back his sleeping wife. Walking back to his bed, Nicholas pulled the silk bed sheets lying comfortably on his sleeping wife. Shayna Castillo was a 5 foot tall mariner woman. Bald headed like the rest of her species with no visible ears on the sides of her head. Shayna was blessed originally with a set of large round 30dd sized breasts that grew to 40dd after bearing six children. Shayna's nipples were dark grey in color as were her areolas. Shayna was a "thick" woman with a small waist, wide hips, thick thighs and a thick round ass; plus she had a beautiful face to boot too. Shayna was grey skinned, with short wavy black marks on both of her cheeks, with three wavy marks running down her forehead. The middle mark being the longest of the three. And although her eyes were closed, the color of her eyes were pink. The size of her eyes were large and almond shaped.

Nicholas smirked back at himself and crawled back into bed and gently grabbed his wife by her wide hips and turned her over on her stomach. Shayna moaned and breathed softly. Pushing her knees forward, beneath her stomach, and raising her large round ass up to the air. Nicholas had his wife where and how he wanted her. Bent over with her large round grey ass raised up for him to do with as he pleased. Sitting down beside her, Nicholas pulled apart the fat cheeks of her ass and licked the soft supple gray skin of her ass. Kneading the soft warm flesh with his hands and fingers, Nicholas couldn't help but become fully erect as he played with and worshiped his wife's ass. Spreading apart her tight, dark gray puckered anus with his index fingers he dug inside of it. Nicholas pushed his eager tongue inside and licked the walls inside, eliciting heavy panting from Shayna.

Grabbing her full attention in addition to slowly waking her up. Nicholas turned his attention from her anus, down to her outer labia which had become wet from the excitement and stimulation on her anus. Spreading the outer labia with both of his middle and index fingers. Nicholas pushed his tongue forward, burying it deep inside of the hole that birthed six of their hybrid children. Swirling his tongue hungrily inside of his wife's sweet alien pussy. Shayna awoke completely, sucking on two of her four fingers fervently. Positioning himself on top of the bed. Nicholas kneeled behind his wife's raised ass. He kept his knees spread apart, resting them beside Shayna's calves. Nicholas positioned the head of his cock that he lubricated with spit from his mouth, and shoved the entirety of his seven inch length inside of his wife's vagina.

"Oh myâ€”Nicholas! Yes! Yes, yes, yes, yes. Hhuungg!" Shayna panted heavily.

With two strong hands gripping onto her hips. Nicholas made this one a quickie for both of them. 

"God, my wife's ass is just, just. It's the best fucking shaped, best looking ass on planet earth! It's so fat and juicy it gives me instant boners just seeing it. Her soft skin ripples across her cheeks and thighs amazingly as I slam my groin repeatedly against It" Nicholas thought privately to himself. 

"I can hear your thoughts baby, you know that, don't you? Oohhh yeah baby. Fuck me! Fuck me!" Shayna said, panting her desire to be fucked more and more

Nicholas buried his cock to the base at the end of each deep stroke. Pressing his scrotum repeatedly against the wetness of her grey puffy vulva. A final thirty seconds of pounding his wife's pussy, and Nicholas refrained from fighting the urge to cum and came inside of his wife. Spurt after spurt after hot spurt, Shayna's vagina filled with the hot seed of her husband. Shortly after his own climax surged and left, Shayna shook from her waist down to her legs and feet from a small orgasm that overcame her. Sagging contently on top of her back as his hands grabbed and kneaded her large breasts beneath her. Nicholas's cock softened and slipped out of his wife's pussy, with a stream of white cum guzzling out of her. 

"I'm going to take a quick shower, baby" Nicholas told Shayna, spanking her on her ass as he moved off her.

"Wait a second there mister. Would you like some company?" Shayna asked him seductively.

"I was just about to ask you to join me sunshine" Nicholas replied, winking back at her.

Inside of their shower which was an enclosed stall with frosted plastic. Hot water ran down both Nicholas and Shayna's naked bodies. Kissing one another, neither avoided touching the other in their most sensitive areas. Nicholas's human tongue was short compared to his wife's which ran at least four inches In length when fully stuck out. Shayna's lips were small and a shade of darker grey compared to the lighter grey complexion of her surrounding face. They were soft and luscious, as if made exclusively for kissing. Nicholas's hands ran down her wet back, curling around the bottom curve of her round ass and sinking into each of her ass cheeks while giving each of them a well deserve smack. Shayna moaned into her husband's mouth as he kneaded the flesh of her ass at his leisure, Just like Nicholas moaned back into her mouth, as she stroked the length of his wet cock below.

"God, this ass was made for my cock. You know that don't you, beautiful?" Nicholas said beside her head.

"Mmmm. Show me just how much you think that's true" She said, daring him.

With a wry smile on his face. Nicholas turned Shayna around, pressed the head of his cock against her dark grey puckered anus, and pushed his hard wet cock inside the tight orifice.

"Aaagh!" Shayna let out, wincing in pain and clawing at the frosted plastic in front of her. 

The pleasure that ran through his cock and branched out throughout his whole body was almost too much for Nicholas. Thrusting forward and back slowly. Nicholas kept his hands clamped down on Shayna's inner thighs as he quickly picked up the pace of his thrusts. Anal sex wasn't new to Shayna, and knew the key to enjoying it as much as Nicholas did, was to relax her body and tense muscles. Quickly, Shayna turned her head to kiss her husband as he fucked her against the frosted plastic stall. 

Slap* Slap* Slap* Slap* Slap* Slap* Slap* Slap*

"Mmmn! Nnnghh! Hhmmnn! Hahh!" Shayna and Nicholas moaned together in the company of the sound of Nicholas's wet groin slapping furiously against Shayna's wet, round thick ass.

"Aaghh! Ooohh! Mmmnnn!! Oh fuck!" Nicholas groaned deeply and satisfyingly as he ejaculated inside of his wife's tight constricting ass. 

Just like back on top of their bed. Nicholas rested against his wife's back, keeping her tightly pressed against his front as his cock pumped hot cum inside her until coming to a stop. Slipping out of the tight orifice. Nicholas's cum dripped out, which got lost with the steaming hot shower water that ran down between her legs.

**Breakfast Table** 

7:30 AM

After a hot shower and dressing themselves in their bedroom, Shayna was in a form fitting black skirt, black suit jacket with a dark blue blouse beneath. And because of her large breasts and the size of her suit jacket, there was a lot of cleavage to see. And On her feet she wore black low heels for work. Nicholas worked as a police officer and only threw on his bulletproof vest over a white muscle shirt. He kept his badge clamped on his jean pants belt. And on his feet he wore black work boots. Seated around the breakfast table in the dining room, were Nicholas and Shayna's four children. Sitting beside Shayna was their youngest daughter Fukayna. Sitting beside her was her brother "Rami," who resembled his mother more than Nicholas. He had her same skin color and markings on his face that Shayna had. He had no hair on his head, which meant he was bald. But his almond shaped eyes were smaller accompanied with human eyes. He had five fingers on his hand, unlike four, which his mother and the rest of her species had. He had no ears as well, just like his mother. 

Sitting next to Rami was his older sister "Azizi" who resembled both her parents fairly equally. She had light brown skin with markings on her face, small almond shaped eyes with her mother's eyes and eye color. Four fingers on her hands and a head full of light brown hair with small ears. And lastly, sitting beside her was the third oldest child. His name was "Gahji" and he resembled his mother a little more than his father. He had the same grey skin, just like he had the same markings on his face as she did. He had four fingers on his hands and no ears beside his head. But his eyes along with their size were human and so was the short buzz cut on his head. Only Fukayna and Rami who were still relatively young, went to elementary school. Azizi went to middle school and Gahji went to High school; The same one his mother worked at. 

"Shayna?" Nicholas said from the table.

"Yes baby, what is it?" She answered from inside the kitchen.

"How are Dov and Hannah doing? I've stopped receiving text messages from them."

"Dov" and "Hannah" were Shayna and Nicholas's two oldest and fully grown children. They had moved out of their parents home roughly four to five years ago. Hannah moved out quicker than Dov though. Hannah, as the first child was ninety percent mariner and ten percent human, with her only human traits being her human shaped eyes and color including her father's personality. Her brother, Dov, was genetically split relatively evenly like his sister Azizi.

"Hannah is doing fine. Married life Is proving to be nice and kind to her. Dov enlisted in the earth self-defense forces. He says he's seeing someone, but says its nothing too serious. I asked them if they've been keeping in contact with you. Hannah says she's been busy with her work, and Dov is not allowed contact with family members while in space. The next time they get in contact with me, I'll make sure they contact you. There's no good reason Hannah has, not to occasionally chat with her father. Dov's situation I can understand" Shayna answered. 

**Outside**

The school bus had arrived at the Cul-de-sac Nicholas and Shayna lived on. The school bus color was white, with English and 'Po po,' the mariner language, running along both sides of the vehicle that utilized anti-gravity to move. The words "School Bus" and "Lincoln Elementary & Middle School" were written in both languages. Nicholas kissed his children on their cheeks and foreheads as he watched them run towards the school bus. Shayna watched her children wave back at her. She blew them all a kiss and held her husband close to her. But Shayna and Nicholas were not the only parents watching their children board the school bus, nor were they the only couple outside their homes. Further down the street was another human-mariner inter-species couple with children sending their two children to the school bus. 

While the Bus rotated around to leave the cul-de-sac, Shayna and Nicholas kissed each other deeply. Nicholas forgot that he was outside and caught the attention of another sexually active couple. As the main home at the top center of the cul-de-sac. Nicholas and Shayna's neighbors to the right were a lesbian couple. The couple was made up of one black human woman in her mid twenties, and a white human woman in her late twenties. The black woman's name was Ramona Miller and the white woman's name was Janet Miller. And as their shared last names hinted at, they were a married couple. They watched Nicholas and Shayna kissing deeply and found Shayna to be sexy and attractive. The Millers and Castillos were long time neighbors. Sharing company for over seven years. Ramona was not entirely a lesbian, but actually bisexual who preferred women a little bit more over men. But she did not shy nor turn away a well hung cock that dangled in front of her. Janet did not like that her wife was Bisexual, but so long as she was a part of her wife's extramarital trysts; she was fine with it. This was the same stance which Nicholas and Shayna shared with Janet. 

Nicholas smacked Shayna's thick ass and caressed it after, getting a lick of the lips from Ramona and Janet.

"Hold on darling, i can hear Janet and Ramona's thoughts loud and clear from here" Shayna whispered to Nicholas, who stared back at the lesbian couple. 

Shayna turned around on her heels and stared back at the couple, shouting at them, "You two want me that bad? If you do, then my husband has to come along also!" Shayna shouted back at them.

Ramona smirked at Janet, then turned back to face Shayna and answered, "Our place tonight! What time works for you two?" 

"How about around eight or nine?!" Shayna asked.

"Sounds good! Good morning officer Castillo!" Ramona shouted, greeting Nicholas.

"Good morning Mrs. Miller!" Nicholas replied with a smile.

"Oh shit! I'm late for work! I'm late for work! Nicholas I have to go now!" Shayna said in a hurry.

Nicholas handed her suitcase and coat. Kissing her one last time for the road, Nicholas watched his wife run around to the driveway of their house where her car was parked. Hovering one foot above the ground. Shayna drove the car backward, rotated it one hundred and eighty degrees and drove away in a hurry.
