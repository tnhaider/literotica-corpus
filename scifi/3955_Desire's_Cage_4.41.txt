 His tongue rasps on her throat, and finds the soft juncture between her neck and shoulder. She sighs deeply and runs her nails down his back. Wrapping her legs tightly around his waist, she nuzzles his ear; he licks and kisses more on her neck, running his sharp teeth over her vein.

She knows what he wants.

But she won't let him have it, not yet.

She pulls his mouth back to her, kissing him passionately, sucking his lower lip into her mouth and nibbling on it. He groans, and she swallows it down and rubs her warm wetness against his rock hard shaft. It pulsates and she shudders, wanting nothing more than to strip him and let him bury himself into her, over and over again. She runs her fingers under his waistband, back and forth, until he's panting, hands frantic to undo his jeans.

She reaches behind and unsnaps her bra, and pulls it off as quickly as she can. She reaches under the short skirt she wore purposefully for him and pulls off the tiny thong. He's got his jeans off, and his manhood juts out, straining, slightly purple from desire, a throbbing center of need. The very tip glistens. She leans down and licks him, just enough to make him curse. He grabs her by her thighs and pulls her close to him, so the tip rubs against her slick folds.

She gasps, and arches her hips and glances up into his eyes.

Inhuman eyes stare back, golden, like the moon during the summer.
