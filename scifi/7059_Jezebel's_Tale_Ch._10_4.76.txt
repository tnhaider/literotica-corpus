 Chapter 10 â€“ The confrontation.

They got up just before 7am to shower, eat a quick breakfast and get ready, they decided to make an impression so they dressed up, low heal boots being the only compromise they made for the situation.

Might as well look hot Jez supposed. Couldn't hurt anyway.

"Damn right," Sandy remarked replying to her thoughts, "and no one does sexy better than you."

Jezebel thought a certain Witch might, but she just smiled at the thought not bothering to say so.

Promptly at 7am the door bell rang and they grabbed their stuff and headed for the door. 

Jez felt good about this, she had thought about the conversation in the Sapphire Club over the last hour and was glad she had not harmed someone with no choice. She got a cold smile on her face at the thought of hurting the person behind it however. That she decided wouldn't be bad at all.

Jez opened the door and surprisingly there was only one Angel there, Captain Daniel Price. She realized he did this on purpose. Mainly to keep the antagonism at a minimum and make sure she did not feel threatened enough to attack. She thought it was fairly brave of him as well.

He nodded at both of them, "Good morning Jezebel, Sandy."

Jez nodded back, not quite sure she was ready to be friends with this Angel, the absurdity of the fact she may have to kill him one day was putting a damper on her feeling. Plus who knew if he could be trusted. She reminded herself his superiors can't be trusted so neither can he as their slave so to speak.

Jez shrugged, then again, 50 years of friendship weighed against a few months of insanity and she understood how her father could do it.

It didn't take long to get to the airport where a Learjet was waiting and before they knew it they were up in the air. Both of them were drinking orange juice, it was a little too early for anything strong. Plus they needed their wits about them.

A few hours later they came to landing at LAX where they found a limo waiting off to the side of the plane. Jez grabbed Sandy's hand, squeezed it gently and led her inside.

There were two extremely large Angels in the limo and they were expressionless, the only sign of life Jez saw was when they nodded to Daniel. 

Daniel nodded back to them and turned to Jez, "Two of the Arch's bodyguards." Then he shrugged.

They were driven to a large mansion just outside of LA close to the beach. Jezebel couldn't help but be impressed by the place. She took a deep breath and relaxed her state. She hoped it would go well but she was ready to kill as well, to protect Sandy as well as herself. Her nerves settled and she felt aware of everything around her.

Jezebel looked over at Sandy who exuded confidence, after exchanging a look they allowed Daniel to lead them into the mansion.

The entryway and stairs were done in marble, marble columns up to the high ceiling lined the staircase. They went straight toward the back, passing by a number of side rooms to enter some open double doors that looked to lead into a large ball room.

There were two more towering Angels at the door that gestured they should stop. They stopped and the guards were completely professional while going through her and Sandy's purses. The one going through Sandy's raised his eyebrows at the small stones in there but shrugged and handed the purse back.

Sandy whispered to Jez, "There is a powerful Witch in there with them."

Jez nodded and understood, she was Sandy's to deal with if it became necessary.

The guards let them past and they walked in the room which gave Jez her first look at an Archangel, it was not what she expected at all. 

She had expected someone like Daniel but this Angel was obese. He had a handsome face she thought, but clearly this Angel always let his powers or others do the actual work. He was wearing white pants and a white button down shirt. 

There were 4 other bodyguards posted around him and standing next to him was an attractive Eurasian woman about 5' tall, she looked about 25 and she had a arrogant smile on her face. 

Jez decided reacting was best in this situation and waited for someone else to talk first. Why risk doing something stupid if she could just show a little patience?

She watched Daniel walk forward and kneel, "Arch, I brought Jezebel as requested, this other is Sandy her roommate.

Jezebel noted he did not name her a Witch, but it was obvious the other woman knew anyway.

"I would like to say that she came rather than fight, I do not believe her to be a threat to you or other Angels unless she or her family is attacked or threatened," Daniel continued, "What is your wish?"

The Arch snorts and dismisses Daniel from the room then turns to Jezebel, "Come forward and kneel."

Jezebel shakes her head and replies respectfully yet firmly, "No, I am hoping for peace but I am not yours to command. I will defend my life and freedom if I must. The purge is over I don't even know why you wanted me here." 

The Arch grimaces, "You are part Angel, I had hoped you would submit to my command. Yes, you aren't a threat now, but you are young, full of foolish ideals. 

"But in four hundred years, when your beautiful Witch partner is dead and buried. When you have felt loss and pain and inevitable betrayal, will you still feel the same? You will also be much more powerful, I cannot risk someone of your power going rogue."

Jez was stunned, she was under no illusion that the years wouldn't change her, but to become a monster? That will never happen. She would not let it.

The Archangel made a subtle signal, immediately the 4 bodyguards started moving toward Jez and Sandy. She noticed Sandy pulling a rock from her purse as she raised her fire shield and prepared to meet any attacks.

===================================

What Jez wasn't seeing was the immediate and fast as thought battle happening between her and the other Witch. Sandy immediately started setting up a water bridge but it kept getting disrupted, they were fighting back and forth using gravity effects to cancel out each other's efforts.

To Sandy however all the opposing forces being built was a mere distraction to keep her opponent busy. She pulled out a stone from her purse, pointed it at the other Witch and activated its potential. 

The other Witch never saw it coming. Despite there being no water bridge lightning cut across the room, a river of it, and took one of the Angels and the Witch out of the fight, permanently. 

Sandy grinned as she remembered last night.

They were in the back of the club getting dressed and Sandy said to Jez, "Remember what your father said about working together, I think I understand what he meant."

Jez replied, "What did you have in mind."

Sandy took out a rock and said, "I could charge this every night, draining myself for 3 weeks, at the end of that I would have a rock that could cast lightning just once without a water channel, it would rip through the air easily."

Jez looked confused for a minute, but then smiled in understanding. As a succubus she took life force through lust, but she could also give it! 

Jez connected to all the men outside and started to feed. When she was mostly full she threw another line to Sandy and fed her life energy. 

Sandy took all the life energy Jez was directing her way and immediately redirected it to the rock as potential energy for lightning.

They did this all throughout the night with no one noticing, every hour or so as new customers came in Jez took a little energy from the fresh room and sent it to her. This added up very fast. 

Sandy knew this advantage wouldn't really work during a fight, but to set up for a fight it would be a game changer. She could accumulate magical items much faster than a Witch normally could.

Sandy's thoughts returned to the present, the rock was useless now but if they got through this she knew they could build up a stock, as well as other useful effects. She did feel a little bad about the people she killed, but not enough to roll over and die, or even worse, watch Jezebel die.

Sandy started to watch Jezebel fight the other three Angels. She wanted to help by grabbing one or more of them with a bubble of gravity to hold them helplessly, but they were moving so fast she couldn't target them. 

All Sandy could do was to surround herself with her own gravity bubble to prevent being burned or struck. Yes, she could blanket an area and take them out, but that would hurt Jezebel as well. She extended a line of force to outline a water bridge, hoping Jez would notice. Safe in her cocoon of gravity she watched helplessly as her love fought for her life.

===========================================

Jezebel knew she had to take them out quickly, luckily for her they were not all using 5 streams of fire each like her father had during training. Maybe they weren't capable of it. Two of them were using 3 streams. 11 were still too damn much for her to last very long. She concentrated on one at a time, attacking with 5 streams of fire and her fists.

She took the first out quickly, once distracted by a right cross to his face her streams of fire lit him like a torch. The second one took almost no effort at all, she cycled the extra power through her streams twice in a fraction of a second and then broke through, he burned. She didn't even have a chance to close to fighting range.

The last one was the one using 5 streams of fire and gave Jez a little more trouble, he was very experienced and she was in trouble. She saw Sandy's line of force and knew what it meant, when she got him into position she said now loudly, inside her head knowing that Sandy would hear it.

Then she kicked high right into his chest and the Angel flew back, right at the same time when Sandy released her lightning through the channel. The lightning wasn't strong enough to kill him but it was enough that he lost focus and Jezebel's 5 whips of fire dove in and burned him to a crisp. 

Jez knew the Arch couldn't defend himself, his command magic was worthless, she could meet his fire and any physical confrontation would be a joke. She also knew it would take just one order from him to set every Angel in North America to kill her. Unfortunately that was not acceptable.

Jez sighed sadly, conflicted but knowing what she had to do. She kicked him in the throat and then he followed his guards in flames.

Jezebel was about to walk away, then paused. Rising from the ashes there was a powerful white light that was blinding to Jezebel. Before she could move away it jumped forward and surrounded her. Jez felt an unbelievable amount of pressure against her body, like it was trying to get inside her. Jezebel passed out.

======================================================

Sandy watched as Jezebel killed the Archangel. She could see an energy she couldn't define rise up out of the ashes and surround Jezebel. She watched as Jezebel passed out on the floor. She could see the energy entering Jezebel's body, forcing its way in. She didn't know what to do.

Once the energy completely disappeared into her lover she went over and knelt on the ground, pulling Jezebel up in her arms. Jezebel felt different to her Witch senses, the succubus side was always clear to her but now Sandy could easily sense her Angel side as well. Jezebel started groaning in discomfort.

========================

Jezebel woke up in Sandy's arms. "What the hell was that?"

Sandy whispered nervously, "Whatever it was its inside you now."

Jezebel got to her feet. She felt a new power in her and started to feel better. In fact, in less than a minute she felt great, like herself instead of beat up and drained. She noticed Sandy's eyes were wide. She pulled Sandy into a deep kiss then looked her in the eyes and whispered, "Thank god you're ok."

Jez looked around, the two guards posted at the door looked pole axed and were just staring. She called out for Daniel to find out what was going on and he came in the room looking both pleasantly surprised and greatly amused.

Jez said, annoyance in her voice, "What the hell was that white crap, and why are you amused?"

"Oh, I am amused at what I am guessing your reaction will be."

Jez said tentatively to him, "Reaction to what?"

Daniel snickered and then said, "Why to this." Daniel got on his knees and said looking up at Jez, "What is your will Arch."

Jez, the beautiful intelligent succubus was speechless for a moment, and then finally said, "Not funny. NO, absolutely not."

When Daniel didn't smile she said, "Oh shit. You have got to be kidding me. Stand up now and explain."

Her thoughts were racing, Jez couldn't be in charge, she was in college, she had a job, and she didn't even like Angels. Most of the ones she met were major assholes. Although she supposed Daniel wasn't so bad, maybe being that old tempered him, the young ones were filled with arrogance and prejudice.

Sandy turned to Jezebel a smart ass expression on her face, "Arch, please take your throne." 

Sandy's eyes were sparkling with mischief while she slowly panicked. How was that fair?

Jez growled and stuck her tongue out at Sandy then suddenly laughed. Sandy's teasing made her feel better but her emotions were fluctuating. She took a few deep breaths and felt a little more grounded. She turned back to Daniel and waited for his explanation.

Daniel said, "Well, Archangels are different from Angels like me and below me in power. They actually have power above and beyond what is part of their soul, and that power is passed on when they die. 

"Usually to the one that kills them, or if they are lucky enough to live to old age, which is about 10,000 for Demons and Angels, they choose who to pass it to. That hardly ever happens by the way, as you know we are a violent lot, both Angels and Demons."

Jez said, "So, what happens now, will the ones above me allow me to hold the power?"

Daniel nods, "Yes, you are isolated here from them, they can communicate with you to give you orders, but it will probably be another 50 years before you even hear from them, when the next purge is set up. 

"Even if you did hear from them they can't replace you. They could send others after you creating an Angelic civil war but what would be the point? They are safe from your power in the other dimension. The only response from them will be political. In other words keep North America from blowing up and they will leave you alone.

"Also, now that your Angel and Demon sides are more in balance, you will not be immune to Angelic command. You can also use it. But there is one limit, you can't use it to command someone to die, or kill themselves, or allow them to be killed. The power will not let you over ride self preservation."

Daniel continued explaining, "You can send them to kill someone else though, since there is always a chance they could win, even if there is an imbalance in power."

Jez opens her mouth then closes it, trying to absorb what is happening. She is a 24 year old college student, and she is in charge of all the Angels in North America. 

How the fuck did that happen.

"I need a drink," Jez says plaintively, "can I get some coffee, with lots of Irish cream please?" 

"OH, and a normal room with comfortable furniture for all of us?" she asks, looking in disgust at the throne like chair. "And burn that thing."

Daniel leads them all to a side room filled with leather couches, a pool table, and a full size bar. He leaves her and Sandy there while he goes to get a coffee from the kitchen.

Sandy says cheerfully, "Didn't see this coming when the day started."

Jez snorts derisively and replies, "Nope, not in a million years. Do you think the North American Angels will ever live down the fact their Arch works in a titty bar?"

Sandy giggles and says with a snicker, "Well a girl has got to eat, unless they want to lure lusty men and women to this mansion they will have to deal."

Jez grins and says facetiously, "We could always make this a house of ill repute, get some girls in."

Sighing Jez says, "Well, headquarters is definitely moving to the big apple."

===========================================

Sandy was getting over the shock of everything and discovering what many others knew before about being in a life and death fight. She was extremely horny. She was also relieved Jezebel was safe. She got up and flung power at the door, locking it with a gravity field, and then she knelt and looked up to Jez.

Sandy said, her eyes dancing with mischief, with a low sultry voice, "I have never eaten out an Arch before." She then started to strip Jez from the waist down.

Looking deep into Jez's eyes Sandy dipped her head down between her legs and licked up her slit, never breaking eye contact.

============================================

Jez looking down at Sandy could see the lust and love in her eyes. They were telling Jez that Sandy wanted, no needed, to pleasure her in this way. Jez shivered and softly gasped at that first lick. She watched Sandy pleasure her with her mouth eagerly, both of them existing in and for that moment only.

Jez gasped loudly in pleasure as she started to peak, "Oh, yeah, ri, ri, right there, don't, stop."

Sandy finished licking up Jez's juice then crawled up on top of her, straddling her legs and kissing her. Their lips teasing each other with nips, suckles and licks. Jez could taste herself on her lover's mouth as her stunning Witch claimed her own.

Jez lifted Sandy's shirt over her breasts without breaking the kiss and then slid her other hand onto her lap and up Sandy's skirt. She squeezed Sandy's pussy lips together and rubbed them against each other finding she was already soaked.

Jez broke the kiss and started licking, nipping and sucking on Sandy's beautiful soft breasts. Teasing Sandy's nipples with her lips and teeth. Jez palmed Sandy's mound then started to shape shift a phallus like length of flesh up between Sandy's pussy lips. 

Sandy arched her back and gasped out, "OH god, that feels so damn good."

Jezebel also grew one outside the back of her hand which was right above her own pussy. It parted her labia and speared inside of her.

===========================

Sandy panting in Jez's ear suckled an earlobe and said, "Oh god Jez."

Sandy started to bounce up and down on the double ended dildo made of Jez's flesh, her tits bouncing in Jez's face. She surrendered herself completely to her wanton need to pleasure and be pleasured by this amazing, sexy, and beautiful Demon she had come to love.

She could read the sexual connections her succubus had with her as they both rose together in shameless ecstasy as she fucked herself hard on Jezebel's flesh. Each bounce also driving it inside Jez and extracting moans and gasps from her. As they both peaked and shuddered inside each other's arms Sandy slowed down to a soft grinding motion no longer in full control of her body.

Shortly, as the pleasure built up again slowly, Sandy started bouncing again fast. It was a lustful rutting. Jezebel let her be in control and set the pace. She grabbed Jezebel by the hair and pushed Jez's face into her tits as they peaked for the second time together, crying out each other's names.

As they slowly came down from orgasm Sandy whispered to Jez with a mischievous lilt to her voice, "Can I keep you?" Then following a soft giggle she melted her body into Jezebel's and kissed her.

==================================================

Jez slowly restored her normal hand, withdrawing her flesh gently from their wet warmth. She had seen a lot of lust and screwing in her short life being a succubus, but she had never seen anyone completely surrender like Sandy just now did. Even the rutting was clearly an expression of giving. It had her heart utterly defenseless.
