 ***** New Day, New Start *****

The morning brought little comfort to Andrew as he bolted up in bed. Drenched in sweat, he shivered against the discomfort of the thick liquid that slowly trickled down his side before he collapsed against his headboard. Lifting the covers, he sighed as he looked at the mess. Andrew couldn't help but notice that there was more cum than yesterday. He had hoped that his experiences with Sara last night would have changed the dream or made it go away, but it hadn't.

Instead the sensations became much more intense. The pleasures he experienced seemed more real. Cleaning himself off with his sheet, he finally found some peace as the tingling pleasure that still haunted him began to fade away. 

Andrew got out of bed, and settled into his morning routine. Twenty minutes later he threw the dirtied sheets into the new washing machine, surprised to find that his parent's sheets were already nestled within. Shaking his head he started the machine and headed into the kitchen where he got a bowl of cereal. Sitting across from his mother at the dining room table he thought to himself, *Man, that was a hell of a lot easier than washing my sheets in the shower.*

Andrew shuddered at the thought of his mother seeing the large creamy stains on his dark sheets, and smirked as he listened to the machine performing its silent work from the hallway.

"That new washer is pretty awesome!" he said offhandedly.

"Yeah, it's a great little energy efficient model." Michelle responded, smiling as she read over her documents. 

"You seem to be in a good mood this morning."

Michelle looked at Dave who sipped his coffee and smiled at her with confidence from the couch. "What can I say. It was great to meet Sara and spend some time with you two last night."

While his mother returned to her documents Andrew blushed and began eating. He was happy for his parents, despite his discomfort at their intimacy. Andrew finished in a hurry and was soon pacing outside the house. Hearing Sara's car turned down the driveway, his heart jumped and his excitement spiked. The noise was impressive as she pulled around their driveway and positioned the passenger door next to Andrew.

Getting into the car he heard Sara say with glee, "Hey Handsome, did someone order a ride?" 

Her face was glowing with happiness as he responded in jest, "Yeah, I think that was my father actually." She gently punched his arm while she laughed in appreciation. 

Leaning across he kissed her before settling into the car. "It's wonderful to see you." 

Sara smiled at him and then waved to his mother who was watching them from the front door.

As Michelle waved, the little red car pulled away and disappeared down the driveway. Dave came up behind her and said, "You know, I was thinking the bedroom might need some extra attention today." As he rested his hands on her hips, he ground himself against her with gentle pressure.

Pressing back against him she said, "Well, I think I know just the man for the job." They rushed back into the house with eager excitement.

Andrew watched Sara with devotion until he noticed something seemed to be bothering her. 

"What's going on, Kitten?"

Turning she said with adoration, "First, best nickname ever!" 

Andrew laughed while Sara squinted and spat in anger, "Second, fuck that bitch!"

He watched her grip the steering wheel tighter. "OK, what happened?" he asked as she glanced at him. Her anger wilted as she looked into his caring eyes.

"No, it's stupid." 

Andrew waited patiently until she suddenly turned the wheel and slammed the gas down. They barreled down the highway, pressing him against the seat as the small red car was soon over the speed limit by ten miles per hour.

"Holy shit, so that's why it's called 'The Rocket,'" he exclaimed as the car settled into its pace. His hands released their death grip from his seatbelt as blood rushed back into his face.

Sara smiled and coyly and said, "Probably." She glanced at his crotch before returning her attention to the road and sighed. 

"OK, seriously, Baby. What's going on?" Andrew asked with a mixture of concern and frustration.

Nimbly drifting around a slower car on the single lane highway, Sara stole a furtive look at him. "It's just, well... Damnit she's such a whore who makes it seem so easy!" 

He could see jealousy and lust written on her face as she fumed at the memories from last night's dream. 

"Hold on a second, are you telling me you are jealous of yourself?"

She looked at him and her cheeks took a rosy hue. "A sluttier, whorier version of myself, yes!" 

He laughed out loud and Sara looked at him with a defensive expression. 

"You know that means you want to be a slutty whore, right?" 

Her eyes widened as she blushed and looked back at the road. Andrew exploded in laughter. "Holy shit! I actually made you blush, after last night I didn't think that was possible."

Dodging around another car she continued blushing, while fighting back a smile. Andrew barely finished saying, "You are so adorable when you blush," before Sara shot a playful glower at him. 

"Sexy, you look sexy when you blush." He corrected his statement. 

She beamed at his revised wording. "If I could give you the same kind of pleasure as dream me, then I would be happy to become your whore."

Andrew could tell that wasn't a joke, there was no sarcasm. She meant every single word. Looking at him she could see lust trying to hide behind his fake blue eyes, and she realized she had an opportunity for revenge. 

"Just imagine, you're in class and Dr. Blake is droning on and on about stupid math things, but all you hear is, slurp, slurp, slurp from under your desk where I have your large hard cock buried deeply..." Sara moaned a little before continuing, "Into my throat."

The car jerked to the side as Sara darted around another slower moving vehicle before turning down the road towards school. Looking at Andrew she could see he was as turned on as she was by the idea of her lips wrapped around him. Despite wanting to pull off into a field, she pushed down her lust and said, "OK, so before we go in, there are two things." 

Sara parked in an empty section of the parking lot. Reaching into the back seat she pulled forward a black grocery bag. Handing it to Andrew, she said with a playful smile, "You should probably change into one of those since you seem to be a messy little boy."

Reaching into the bag Andrew pulled out a package of adult diapers. His face flushed with embarrassment as he asked, "Really?" 

Sara smiled at him with genuine love. "It's either these..." she tapped the package, "Or this..." she ran her hand over his hard dick and across a nearly invisible large wet spot on his black jeans. Licking her fingers she moaned before continuing, "It's your choice, but I know what I would choose." 

Andrew blushed and nodded. "You would choose thirty minutes behind the gym, just like me." 

Sara beamed at him and nodded emphatically before correcting, "I'm thinking more like two hours!" They both laughed while Andrew started taking off his pants to change.

"What was the second thing?" Andrew asked as he studied the package, figuring out how best to use the diaper. 

"Well, I don't think you are going to like this one," she assured him as he looked at her with a raised eyebrow. 

"You mean more than I like the diaper?"

Laughing, Sara explained, "Well, I'm going to try and take care of the Zack situation, and I don't want you freaking out." 

Andrew studied her face as she watched him pulling on the diaper. Her eyes were fixated on his still hard dick. "What is your plan?" he asked her plainly, trying to get a sense of how worried he should be.

Sara grinned at him in mischief and asked, "You have money for bail, right?" 

Andrew narrowed his eyes. "That's not funny. I want to know what you are planning!" 

While he pulled on his pants, Sara poked him in the chest and stated in a firm voice, "My nerd." She then poked herself and said, "Your Guardian. Those were the terms and you need to let me do my job."

As Andrew tried to say something Sara interjected, "Hey, I don't tell you how to nerd do I? You need to let me do my job. I'm just trying to work over here." They both laughed and then Sara concluded, "Trust me, it won't be too bad." As Andrew nodded with renewed comfort, she snuck in, "Unless... No, it'll be fine." 

When Andrew looked at her with concern, he could see that she was grinning at him. He sighed in resignation.

They both stepped out of the car, Andrew squirmed in discomfort as his body got used to the feeling of the diaper under his pants. He admired how good Sara looked in her loose jeans, a blouse and no bra. While Andrew slung the heavy rucksack over his shoulder he noticed that Sara's backpack could best described as an almost empty sack with thin arm straps.

Taking her hand, Andrew started walking towards the front door. His nervousness built as they got closer to the building. Giving Sara's hand a gentle squeeze, Andrew took a deep breath. Opening the door, they entered the school.

***** Into the Breach Again *****

The halls seemed the same as he stepped into the hallway. Students busied themselves in small groups, or moved with purpose as they prepared for their day. Unlike yesterday, Andrew recognized many of the faces, and felt like he was starting to get a sense of this place. As he began walking to his locker he could feel the change in mood as people began to notice him holding hands with Sara Mitchel.

Despite himself, his anxiety welled up. He felt the unspoken questions behind many of the shocked expressions that followed them down the hall. Sara squeezed his hand, and he could see the calm confident certainty that backed the adoration she felt for him reflected back on her face. 

She leaned down and gently kissed him before whispering, "Better?" 

Sara could feel the warm appreciation radiating off of Andrew as she basked in his affection. He whispered back, "For me, totally." Looking around the hall he could see a few open mouths and many more surprised glances. "For them, well I guess it answers any questions they might have had." Looking back at Sara he said, "Better make sure there are no doubts."

Andrew's arm had a slight shake as he reached up and grabbed Sara by the back of the neck with a nervous hand. Pulling her into a deep and passionate kiss, Sara leaned into him with a gentle sigh. His cock tensed and moist warmth oozed against his thigh. Andrew was thankful for the diaper.

"Wow," Sara said in a husky voice as they parted. They stood on trembling legs before walking to Andrew's locker hand in hand.

Most faces turned away as Sara looked around in confidence. Andrew kind of enjoyed this new sense of celebrity as he glanced around nervously. That was, until he saw Zack Taylor. Zack was glowering at Andrew, his face a perfect mask of jealousy and resentment. Elizabeth hung off his arm desperately trying to get his attention. Bruce looked at Andrew and Sara with a happy but confused expression that neither of them could figure out.

Andrew opened his locker and placed the grocery bag with the remaining diapers inside, just in case he needed them later. Sara leaned against the locker beside Andrew. She watched the passing crowd while Andrew knelt and opened his rucksack. 

"Where is your locker?" he asked Sara while he looked around the hall. With a quick and discreet movement Andrew transferred a diaper to the bottom of his backpack.

"I should only have a couple books, not much need for a locker," she said while they both watched Zack.

Elizabeth was looking between Zack and Sara as she yelled at the football player. While they could not hear what she was saying Andrew was pretty sure it was not good for Zack. Andrew was starting to feel bad for his unintended antagonist when Sara knelt down. 

"No matter what happens, don't worry. OK?" 

Andrew looked at Sara with concern before glancing at Zack. He pulled her in for another gentle kiss that reflected his conflicted emotions about what she was planning. As they separated he looked her in the eyes for a second before letting her go. 

"Seriously, don't get arrested."

Sara flashed Andrew a playful smile as she said with confidence, "Got it, if the cops show up, run like hell... I like it." 

She tousled his hair before heading off. Andrew shook his head as she quickly closed the distance to Zack. Concern flooded over him almost at once.

The young jock noticed Sara approaching only a moment before she arrived. Bruce and Steve were both hitting him on the arms, trying to get his attention away from Elizabeth. The last thing they heard was Elizabeth yelling, "If you love her soo much you should-" when Sara arrived and grabbed Zack by the back of the neck. 

Squeezing with a firm grip, she growled, "We need to talk!" 

Zack winced in intense pain as she dragged him towards the boy's bathroom. Bruce and Steve started to move but Sara's glare stopped them cold. She pushed the much larger athlete into the restroom and the door closed behind them. Andrew was shutting his locker when he noticed Bruce looking at him with concern for his friend. Andrew shrugged as if to say, "Hell if I know."

They were both distracted by the sound of the bathroom door banging open. A few boys ran out into the hall, hurrying to zip up their pants or buckle their belts. Confused and embarrassed, they looked around the hallway.

The entire corridor was silent with pregnant anticipation. After a solid minute the bathroom door finally opened. Sara came walking out, graceful and carefree, smiling at everyone as if nothing had just happened. She grabbed Andrew's hand and they headed towards Dr. Blake's classroom amid a sea of stunned faces. 

"So here's the deal. We leave Zack and his friends alone, and he won't even look at you sideways." 

Andrew was amazed. A proud smile crossed his face as he said, "Best guardian ever!"

Sara luxuriated in the mixture of gratitude and lust that she could see in Andrew's eyes. They both fought the urge to kiss, realizing they would never make it to class if they kept allowing themselves to get distracted. Andrew watched Sara's breasts bounce a couple of times before licking his lips. Sara gave him a playful bump with her hip and they both laughed while Andrew blushed.

The young couple stopped outside of Dr. Blakes classroom, and Andrew asked, "Where are you heading?" 

Sara rolled her eyes and answered, "Econ." She made a face like she had just sucked on a lemon. 

He laughed. "Well if you want, I can give you a hand with it tonight." 

Sara looked like she was about to say something, but instead she unslung her bag and rifled around. A second later she asked, "Speaking of nerdy stuff, think you could figure out why this stopped working?"

She handed him her phone and a long awkward charging cable. Taking the phone from her he asked, "What's wrong with it?" 

"I don't know, it won't turn on." 

Andrew began coiling her charging cable as he prepared to ask something. Sara interrupted with another bump of her hip. "Yeah, I charged it," she said with a playful but defensive grin.

Andrew laughed while tucking the precisely bundled charging cable in his rucksack. "Let me see what I can figure out." 

Leaning down Sara whispered, "Best nerd ever." She pecked him on the lips before sashaying away. Looking over her shoulder she was pleased to see him watching her ass as she winked and disappeared around the corner.

***** Hello, Old Friend *****

The classroom was already full and Andrew could tell that many of the students had either seen what happened with Zack, or were watching Sara and him outside of the room. He was surprised by how quickly his shy nervousness overwhelmed him as he looked around the room. Andrew sat in the back next to Seth, who waved at him with a welcoming smile.

Andrew's cheeks were red and his head was down as he set up his desk. Once Andrew was settled Seth said, "Man, I used to use the one point five inch binder, but eventually I just had to upgrade to the two inch." 

Andrew glanced around the room at the many faces that were watching him before turning his attention to Seth with a confused expression. 

Seth continued, "Because, you know, I roll deep son. I decided to live that baller lifestyle." 

Andrew smiled but managed to stifle his laugh when Seth continued, "Shit, check this out." Reaching down into his bag, Seth slammed a variety pack of colored highlighters onto his desk. "Boom, I got the motherfuckin' rainbow, bitch!" 

Andrew burst into uncontrollable laughter as Seth smiled and put his highlighters away just as the bell starting class rang.

Roll call passed quickly despite Dr. Blake's purposeful emphasis on Andrew's first name. Andrew was thankful that as class progressed the backwards glances and pointed side conversations about him died down. He was surprised by how true Zack was to his word, not looking back once, even when Bruce and Steve stole pensive glances at him. While Seth took copious notes Andrew didn't even open his binder, finding Dr. Blake tedious and boring.

Andrew wondered if Sara was having an effect on him. Sure, Dr. Blake was tedious and boring but he would have at least made an effort to take notes before he met Sara. As he looked at the front of the room he noticed that Dr. Blake was looking at him with some kind of expectation. He could see that many of the students were also waiting on his response to something.

Looking at Seth he could see his friend had written, "CAR ACC VS DECEL!" in large and hastily written letters in his notebook.

"Well, Dr. Blake. Cars are forced to accelerate constantly due to the numerous and various forces that act upon them, sapping their forward momentum. Things like wind resistance, friction with the ground, driving up hills and even the weather are examples of these types of external forces." Taking a breath he could see that the teacher was looking at him with disappointment and suspicion. 

"That is very concise and accurate, 'Andrew.'"

As everyone returned their attention to the whiteboard Andrew looked at Seth and mouthed, "Thank you, again." 

Seth smiled and nodded as he returned to his note taking. Andrew kicked himself for getting distracted enough to almost fall for that ambush.

Through the rest of class Dr. Blake attempted a couple more times to trip up Andrew with what would have been tricky questions for most of the other students. Andrew simply gave short and concise answers until Dr. Blake finally stopped calling on him. The two "A" student's kept looking at Andrew with aggravation and disappointment.

A couple of questions were directed at Bruce who fumbled his way through, managing to get to the answer after a couple attempts. The final question was directed at Zack who struggled with the concepts so completely that Dr. Blake mocked his attempts in front of the entire classroom. Andrew was conflicted between being satisfied that Zack was being put in his place, and anger at the teacher for abusing his responsibility. He was struggling with this internal conflict when the bell rang, dismissing class.

He could see that his friend had taken a staggering amount of notes. "Thanks for the tip on that question man." 

Seth and Andrew tucked their supplies away while Seth responded, "No problem." Looking at the front of the room, Seth continued in a whisper, "He can kinda be a real dick. He has like a sixth sense for when you are distracted and he pounces like an arrogant little tiger, A tiger with downs syndrome."

Andrew laughed as the two teens walked out of the room. 

"Well, I guess I will see you in PE. I loaded up 'Eye of the Tiger' if you need it." Seth offered as he started to walk in the opposite direction.
