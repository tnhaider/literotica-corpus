 Volume 4: Dereliction of Duty 

Chapter XVI: A Lotus in Bloom 

Sleep was a thing Tessarie never really understood; going unconscious for several hours only to wake up groggy and barely coherent? What was it really good for and why did everything in the known world seem to do it? What was Tess missing out on, she wondered as she breathed in Leslie's scent. The older woman laid curled up in the elf's arms with Keiter in front of her, splayed out and snoring- content that all was right with the world. 

In their state of oblivion, they didn't worry about the future or question themselves; there was no fear or anger. Maybe it was how creatures dealt with those kinds of things and elves' own ways of just worked for them. Maybe that was what made them so special. . . 

That and magic. 

Like the magic that'd turned her into a freak- one could control it if they knew how and elves were meant to handle it. Tess hadn't learned how to do so; she'd failed and proved to everyone in her family, the entire community! Among special people, she was the most special of all- she was a failure. 

But she wasn't entirely alone, was she? She was a failure who'd found others, friends! Of some of the strangest varieties she could have imagined, she walked with humans and a kobold- of all things- and even an elf-blooded woman! Oh, but the fates had smiled on her. It could have been so much worse. . . 

Tess sighed deeply. Maybe it was the tingle from the cleric and his new disciple but Tess felt surprisingly good for the first time in a long time. She could have hope for the future and more than that, she knew she wasn't alone. People tolerated her; if anything Leslie was an example of that. 

The little elf hugged her close, nuzzling into the nape of the woman's neck. Maybe her uncle had been right that there was purpose to everything and no suffering went without some kind of reward or lesson to be learned. 

What that lesson was exactly, she wasn't sure of just yet but maybe it'd become apparent in time. In the meantime, she snuggled into Leslie's warmth, listening to the slow rhythm of her breathing and occupying her mind with thoughts of the future. When the first slivers of morning light broke the darkness of the room she gently nudged Leslie awake. 

"Ngh. . .?" 

"Hi. . ." 

The woman drew in a deep breath and reached for Tess's hand, cupping it tenderly. "Hey." She pulled Keiter's sleeping form closer against her naked tummy and for a moment the little kobold seemed to nuzzle into her warmth only to go limp once more. 

"He really likes you. . ." Tess pushed up on her forearm to rest her chin on the woman's arm- even knowing Leslie couldn't see, she imagined that she was being watched and so she tried to smile. "I think his goddess does, too." 

"Mmm, well, it's either the sleepiness or the soreness- can't really tell one from the other at the moment- but I think I'm pretty partial to them too." She stroked Tess's blonde hair behind her ear, unerringly guiding it to rest. "It's nice to be wanted." 

"Wanted." Tess kissed her bicep as she drank in the older woman's natural, shameless beauty. Laying there completely naked between an elf and a kobold and she didn't look any more out of place than silk would on a queen's dress. She was a pale, radiant light in a place that needed it most- with the faintest touch of divinity caressing her natural essence, she had it in her to be a force of nature, held back only by her ability to comprehend it. 

They laid in silence for a few seconds before Tess kissed her again. "You- you think Isira is ready for you?" 

"Mmm. It's too early for that kind of talk. If She wants to hear my prayers, she will. . ." She pouted her lips a little, considering. 

"It's not a crime to want that. If it comforts you-" 

"I don't need comfort," without warning she pulled Tess into a deep kiss- so firey was her passion Tess couldn't help but wilt in her warmth. She wrapped her arms around the woman and returned what she was able; a mere flicker of a candle to her inferno. Even her strength somehow surged, daring the little elf to resist, making it clear she was still able to carry herself with pride. 

When Leslie finally let up they were panting into each other's mouthes and- Tess imagined- searching for the words to express themselves. There were none, of course, but still they tried. Through more kissing, more touching and more hugs they explored one another as outcasts sharing common ground. In so many ways they were a family devoid of bloodlines and pressure. The kind of family that existed regardless- maybe even in spite of- the world at large. 

The longer their explorations continued the stronger the woman's divine essence seemed to swell. Power and ageless warmth rippled through her body seeming without end or beginning and the kiss of her natural magic grew with it- she gave off an aura of contentment. Divinely inspire, human grown and for the first time in a long time, completely at peace with herself and the world. 

Tess couldn't help but be drawn in by her aura and before either of them knew it she was cuddling the woman and trying to melt into her. It was right. It was just. It was good. 

Leslie pulled her in just as close, stroking Tess's back with her free hand as she held Keiter close. Neither of them spoke but in their quiet appreciation words felt easy, life felt full of possibility and- for the first time in her short life, Tess was happy. She sighed and giggled into Leslie's neck. 

"Me too, kiddo. Mmm." 

"You feel really good." 

"You're just saying that because you're poking my ass." 

"Uh- oh! Erm- s- sorry." 

Leslie chuckled. "I don't want to ruin anything you might have planned- don't give me that look, I know you're giving me a look- but when were you going to go meet with your friend?" 

"Fri- oh, Sarah."Tess licked her lips. "I- I was going to say we should probably get going soon. It's sunrise, people do things at sunrise, usually, so maybe it's a good time." 

Leslie took a deep breath, leaning back against Tess and sighing it out. "Okay," 

"I'm sorry-" 

"Ah, none of that. I didn't bring you two into my home to hear you apologize-" she grinned slyly. "Well, I hadn't brought you here to do a lot of things but we still did them. So! Now you're going to pay the price for my hospitality." 

"Uhm- O- Okay? What must I do?" 

Leslie mocked indignation with a hand to her chest. "Not even a question? What if I wanted to make you into stew or something, huh? Or, I dunno, hook you up to a milk pump-" 

"I can run really fast. . .?" 

"The proper answer is 'if your mouth is the milk pump, I think I'm okay with this." She booped the elf on the nose with a little grin. Slowly she turned to face Tess full on and traced a finger down the side of her cheek, raising it with the crook of her finger. The touch lingered warm and subtle and if Leslie could have seen the confusion she probably would've understood Tess's hesitation. 

But instead of speaking she took the lotus flower pendant she'd been given and wrapped both of their hands around it. She kissed Tess's hand first and then her own. Murmuring, she whispered. "Thank you." 

"I- I didn't do anything. . ." 

"Sometimes you get lucky and change someone's life without meaning to or knowing what you did. You'll get used to it. But. . . .and don't take this the wrong way, but if you're going to go out crusading with your friend here, you're going to need something that doesn't look like you rolled a beggar for it." 

"I don't- rolled a beggar? I don't understand." 

Leslie hauled herself up to her knees and eventually her feet, stumbling a little as she found her footing. Tess eventually managed to muster the courage to follow and was lead to one of the outfits ringing the walls of the home- the seamstress picked up one of the smaller outfits with the travel coat and comfortable looking pants and she turned to Tess. "Well, no offense but that 'dress' you had was a mess. I'm guessing it was a human one and you just cut it up, so maybe this'll be a little closer to your fit." 

"I- I- I can't accept this." 

"You can't afford not to, either." She pushed the clothing to Tess gently. "Pretty sure it's a sin or against the law not to accept a gift from a naked woman- unless it's her cooking first thing in the morning, because that's bound to go poorly." 

"But-" Leslie silenced her with a finger. 

"No buts. I like you, but I don't like you well enough to let you insult me by saying no. . ." She eased into Tess's space and kissed her chin. "Please, let me do something nice for you too." 

Tess looked away warily, unsure what to do. The last time she'd accepted a gift from someone- no, Leslie wasn't like that. She wouldn't hurt anyone, it was Tess who'd been wrong. She looked to the woman and smiled a coy, weak little grin. "Thank you. . ." 

Leslie eased smoothly into her professional mindset that Tess missed it until she had hands groping down her sides. "Go get dressed and I'll see where it needs to be taken in."

Half an hour later Keiter awoke while Leslie finished off the hem of Tess's blouse. The clothes flattered her figure but allowed for a wonderful degree of mobility and breathability by way of woven mesh concealed by tie-back flaps and the coat only added to the charm and utility; it was an ensemble fit for royalty and it was hers. 

She giggled at the thought. 

Keiter quietly shuffled into his robe and wandered over as Leslie finished the last stitching, his strange smile was firmly in place but his eyes were as unreadable as ever. After appraising Tess he stroked Leslie's leg. "Your passion shows in your work and your soul." 

"I suppose it shows in the rug, too." She said around the pins clamped between her lips. "And you're going to leave me to clean it up! That's gratitude-" Keiter hugged her leg. "Oh no you don't, you're not going to cuddle your way out of this." 

"But it was cuddling that got me into it." 

Tess gaped, Leslie laughed. Once finished with her stitching the human plucked a set of boots that Tess was a little too small for. She wasn't about to turn them down, though. Once her 'client' was fully dressed, Leslie leaned back on her haunches. "How's she look?" 

"Ready for the world," Keiter said softly. With a glance to the woman, he turned to Tess. "How do you feel?" 

Looking at the two who were eying her expectantly she fidgeted. With a little flourish she turned only to crouch down in front of Leslie and kiss her. "Thank you. Thank you so much." 

"Tit for tat. . ." 

Keiter took her shoulders gently so that she'd know where he was in relation to her, he spent several seconds bringing her hands to Tess's smile. His voice was careful, hallowed and reverent. "This is your gift to the world, the smiles you create exist because of you. . . My friend, this world needs you." 

"B-" 

"Don't think. . . Feel it." His reptilian eyes turned to Tess, searching. "All things you do have power but it's only with intention that that power can manifest, you are more powerful than anything you can see. More powerful than the stars in the sky because you act on the world and those around you." 

Leslie dampened her lips and took in a shaky breath. "What if I'm not who you think I am?" 

"What I think doesn't matter, the day to day comes and goes- it hurts us because we know our experiences in that moment are powerful and live in our body. But pleasure and passion and life and happiness, these can't be broken by our body. Our hearts carry on with them, our souls live it through our intention." 

Tess listened to the kobold lay out his goddess's philosophy, curious and slightly unnerved. He was promising her the world, not because she wanted it but he honestly believed she could have it. . . 

Some part of her elven heart wanted it too. . . 

"Day by day, think of the things you bring to the world and whether or not they are things you believe belong in it. Isira does not act on our behalf because She knows we are capable of so much. But She does listen. She does watch and She does comfort. . ." 

Leslie's shoulders sagged a little- not in surrender but in thought. "So you're saying it's not just sex and hedonism?" 

"That depends on how you want to live it. These things are important to many, but I think you have in you the spark of something deeper. You deserve the happiness you wait for. . . .but how will it manifest?" 

"I think-" Tess paused uncertainly. "I- I think it'd start with a smile." 

"I wouldn't mind that," Keiter offered. 

The blind seamstress laid her hands on her thighs and, surprisingly, chuckled. "You two are crazy- and I'm probably insane for listening. But you made your point, Keiter. . ." she turned and took his shoulders. "I get it. I- I get it." She nodded. "I like the idea or I wouldn't be wearing Her flower, now would I?" 

"There is so much I wish I had time to teach you, but Sarah-" 

"I know," she kissed his forehead. "I'll ask around, there are some bard troupes that come through here every other week." 

"Be careful, not all who claim to serve Her actually do so." 

"That's humanity for you- we could screw up a wet dream." She chuckled ruefully. "Or make one. But come on, I'm not a little girl. I- I'll work on it. I'll pray and- well, maybe I'll take up that gardening hobby I keep saying I'll get around to." 

Tess smiled. "I think you'd have a wonderful garden." 

"You say that because you've seen the bush," Leslie shot back with a grin. "That- yeah, maybe I'll start there, I doubt many gardens have been grown in Isira's name." 

Keiter smiled a distinctly proud, fatherly grin. "I wish I could have shown you the temple. We had many paintings and sculptings! Sculpts? We had a lot of art." 

Tess didn't have it in her to mention the fact that the 'art' looked like someone had threw up on canvas and then died on it, but the smile Leslie wore told her it probably wouldn't have mattered anyway. The woman had found something that had the potential to make her happy- the focus point to see it through and the knowledge that she had friends in the world. 

She couldn't have been put off by anything. 

Tess's heart swelled and she grinned. "There were a lot of them- all kinds of things done in her name, but I didn't see a garden." 

"Then that's what She needs!" Keiter offered. "A grand garden with healthy plants and ripe tomatoes!" 

"Tomatoes? You're kidding me, right? Well, whatever- Just. . . .one question." 

"Anything." 

A sudden wash of timidness messed up her features and she hesitated. She shook her head a second later. "What do you think she thinks of ghosts?" Her attention flickered briefly to the spilled urn and the spray of ashes around it. 

Keiter glanced at it and turned to the woman, taking her hands. "I asked Her once when I became Her voice, for a friend. She surprised me. . ." 

"O- Oh?" 

"She asked me if it was worse to cling to a memory in anger. Or loss. Or love and warmth. Or not to remember it at all. . ." 

Leslie swallowed. "W- Which did your friend answer?" 

"I. . . I've never had the courage to ask her, but I think beneath the masks she wears, she would remember them for eternity rather than forget even a moment." 

"Yeah? Why's that?" 

"Because love comes from working through the worst parts of existence together, not just the good ones. In our memories and hearts that love can still burn strong, even if the object of it isn't at our side." 

Leslie's features roiled with unsaid objections, uneasiness and uncertainty and maybe even anger warred across her face for a flicker of a moment but she refused to voice her thoughts, even when Keiter hugged her and whispered reassurances. Tess followed a few moments later but there was nothing more to be said between the three- even if there were oceans of things they could have talked about. Leslie, as she had been since the start, remained firmly in control of her interaction with them and she decided when it would end. . . 

But she wouldn't let it end without words Tess had never thought she'd hear. "I love you both. . . .and I'll show Her I wasn't a lost cause." 

"There's no such thing as a lost cause that's still fought for." Keiter whispered. "Isira won't let you fail, even if you feel like you are." 

Tess clung to the woman in lieu of saying anything. It was a weak gesture, but it was all she had; in the realm of gods and faith, she was far too poorly equipped. It hadn't been the first time she was outmatched, it wouldn't be the last, but so long as her new friend was happy, that was all that mattered. 

# 

The two of them left Leslie's house with the sun hanging low in the early morning sky, some feet away they passed a staggeringly beautiful woman approaching Leslie's home wearing the most luxurious silk dress Tess had ever seen- she radiated power and wholeness unlike anything Tess had ever felt but something about that power compelled her to turn away and ignore it. A few seconds down the path and she'd forgotten what she was thinking about. 

"I saw you leave that bag on the couch," Tess said quietly. "What was in it?" 

"You can't start a garden without seeds," Keiter settled his hood into place. "Sometimes it takes many seeds to start, so maybe she'll start many gardens." 

"Seed- like, did you-" Tess frowned. "Did you do something in a bag?" 

"It's coin." He said flatly. "Seed money? You've never heard the term?" 

"No, I hadn't." They rounded the corner to the main square, almost running into someone. It took a moment to register that there was a crowd gathered around the lip of the central hub of the village, clustered around to watch something. At first she thought there might have been a play or something, but it quickly became apparent that there wasn't going to be anything jovial going on. 

Sarah was on the other side of the square with her pistol and an unfurled scroll clutched in opposite hands. She was saying something to someone- Tess's heart sank when she saw Sorash's soldiers standing on the other end of her irritated rambling. 

If her heart fell when she saw the guards though, it absolutely vanished when she saw a black clad figure creeping up on Sarah's flank with a dagger in either hand. 

Tess opened her mouth to scream a warning.
