 Daemon discovered two things during Court the next morning: that the Matrix conferred telepathic communication between him and Sunny; and that it could be used to keep himself from growing bored. Mainly because he glanced at Sunny and thought with a disgusted sigh, as the spoilt, forceful Princess Shirra postured and preened in front of them, I could be suckling your breasts right now, instead of listening to this piece of crap. Hell, I'd rather you were suckling mine! 

Wow...that's better than what I was wishing! And certainly far more legal...

Sunny and Daemon looked at each other, startled.

You heard that?

You heard that, too?

Wow...coolâ€”I can make all sorts of comments to someone who understands, without fear of anyone overhearing me complain about these...people!

Yeah, but what if we start laughing in the middle of it? Sunny pointed out dryly, returning her gaze to the princess. People would wonder why we were laughing, and it could be politically disadvantageous. Before we're revealed as the new Imperials, that is.

True. Unfortunately. But if I could, I'd still rather be suckling your breasts right now. I can taste your flesh on my tongue, feel the softness of your breast with my lips, tease the crinkled little peak with my lips...

Sunny's eyes widened. Through the layers of her Astorran gown and the bra underneath, she could feel lips on the left peak. His lips. You're...you're imagining it so vividly, I can feel it...

Really? Quick, imagine you're licking your way down my chest, Daemon shot back.

Focusing, she imagined rimming his navel with her tongue. She heard him suck in a short, sharp breath.

...That's not my chest, woman.

She smiled, unable to help herself. But I like your belly-button. It's tasty.

...Are you imagining licking lower?

Yup.
