 Una awoke with the sunlight warmly kissing her face. She had been at the Sun Fortress for two nights now. She was neither a common prisoner, nor was she free to leave. Aidan loved her, this she was certain of, but there were rules of war. One doesn't simply kidnap a warlord's wife then let her go. Aidan assured her that no ranking members of the Osis tribe had been harmed or captured during the raid, and as such Gael was almost certainly unharmed. According to him, the raid was a cautionary measure to discourage the Osis army from invading Taurani land. 

 She hadn't let Aidan share a bed with her since their first intimate encounter. She was overcome with guilt, and also concerned that she would be seduced even furtherâ€”

 A knock at the door interrupted her thoughts.

 "Come in," she replied softly.

 "Good morning." Aidan entered the room, carrying a basket of pastries along with a carafe of juice. 

 "How's my beautiful woman?"

"Don't you mean your hostage?" She chided back.

He paused, eyeing her with a challenging stare before sitting down next to the bed, lowering himself to her level.

"How's my beautiful hostage?" He replied.

"Fine." Una replied poutingly, though she accepted the offering and grabbed what appeared to be a jam-filled danish from the basket. She nibbled slowly at first, tasting it thoughtfully, then nodded approvingly and munched voraciously. 

"Would you like to join me on a ride today?" Aidan offered as he bit a sizable piece off a croissant.

"I'm allowed to leave the castle?" She spit back with angst.

"With me you can go anywhere you want."

She looked at him playfully, pouring herself some juice. 

"I suppose I'll grace you with my presence," she mustered.
