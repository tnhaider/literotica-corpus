 Ahhh...Chapter Six at last! As usual, this took far too long and I have to once again thank the fans of this story for your patience. I have recently obtained Dragon Naturally Speaking, a voice recognition program...it helps make it easier, but not necessarily faster. It should help in one area...in theory. If there are any more spelling errors, you can blame the software, not me. 

It may seem at times, in this chapter that I am jumping around a bit too much. I ask that you be patient with me as I am building characters and situations for future chapters.
