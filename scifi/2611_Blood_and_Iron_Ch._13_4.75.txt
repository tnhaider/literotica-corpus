Ronnie smirked at me. "Suddenly, hunter, so little confidence in your persuasive abilities?"

She laughed, and Hjordis and Donna joined her. As the laughter tapered, the princess watched me carefully, her eyes again doing that shift thing from amused to appraising, as she said, "I wish to see the bandit's treasure."

Her impassive blue eyes focused on mine, she repeated, "Their cache, my hunter. Where is it?"

I stared into those mesmerizing blue eyes, answering simply, "Under the barn, your grace."

One eyebrow came up a smidgen as her eyes probed mine. "Show me."

In a lithe motion, the Princess bounced to her feet. She reached down, proffering her hand, then grinning widely when I ignored her offer, getting myself up far less gracefully. She smiled at Hjordis and Donna, reaching out and saying pleasantly, "Please come along." 

The princess turned to the ever attentive Blade, saying briskly, "You as well, with Jeremy, and bring light crystals please."
