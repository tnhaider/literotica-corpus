 Violence warning for this chapter.

"Rise and shine, Captain!" Maria called out, and though her suit muffled her somewhat, her voice echoed over the intercom.

Davison rolled over on his narrow mattress and nearly toppled out of bed. Not even he was sure of the exact content of his grumble, but his tone contained everything he needed to say.

Maria didn't even slow down. "We had a deal, remember? For a week, me and Manuel would only wear the suits inside, and if we didn't catch anything, you'd take off your suit, too. Once we finally get Isaac to stick to the deal, we'll all be able to go without the suits, inside as well as outside. Now get up, get out there, and show everyone that the captain of this ship isn't afraid of germs."

Davison considered it a low blow to remind him of his leadership duties, but he still had some remnants of pride left. Within five minutes, he was on the other side of the airlock.

He was surprised to find himself rejuvenated in the fresh air. Within the span of a few breaths, he was no longer weary. "I feel like I could take on the world," he said.

"Well, you'll have to take on Isaac first," Maria responded. "And my guess is that you'll want to do it soon."

"It's his loss if he doesn't want to feel like this. I'll be spending all day out here, just as soon as I brush my teeth and . . . go to the bathroom . . ."

"You never asked how we handled that. Isaac's letting us borrow his trowel."

He doubted that Maria had previously heard all the profanities he used, but all she did was listen in silence and smirk.
