 Harry's notes: Nearing the end of this story friends. Thanks to all who have commented here and in private pm's and feedback. This is the shortest chapter in the book as the story begins to turn once more to darker conflicts that will come in chapter 12. As always in my stories there is romance, heartbreak, and hope somewhere in the lines. Enjoy

It was early when Oldman began his bitching. Harry opened one eye and explored his surroundings.

"What?" He asked in confusion. He could not remember leaving the window last night.

--Customers are downstairs, buddy. It's time to rise and shine; and just so you know, you're talking to yourself again.

Harry sighed, swinging his legs to the floor and dressing slowly. He stumbled out of his door and past the banks of monitors that were mostly for show now. Six Fay, sleeping wrapped in their wings, were the only other inhabitants of the third floor. He called the cafe' while he emptied his bladder.

--Lori, is there any chance of getting a cup of coffee up here? Her amused thought returned.

--I live to serve the people and customers, Har ri na. I will send Mira. Is there anything else?

--Are you busy down there? He asked, as he washed face and hands.

--I am feeding the hungry horde; people continue to walk in; things are normal here. She sent the image of fluttering, dismissive fingers and returned to her duties.

--My love, where are you? I missed you when I woke up, he called next, nodding to the Fay sentry at the top of the landing, then made his way down the stairs to the second floor fitting rooms.

--Good morning, love. Her sweet thought caressed his mind, sending imaginary kisses his way. ...I'm in the store-front talking to customers. I'll be up soon. There is much work today. Are you ready?

Mira walked into the room and placed a tray of coffee and bear claws beside Harrys fitting table. He sent the image to Sandra and replied.

--I will be in a moment. Harry sweetened his coffee and performed obeisance to Mira, sighing with the first sip. Mira sat on the floor and studied his detached observation of reality with interest.
