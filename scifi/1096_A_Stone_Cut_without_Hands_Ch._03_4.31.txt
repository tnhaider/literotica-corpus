 Note to Readers

This story has a surprise ending. I am posting it for you to read in the hope some of you will be willing to help. I need you to guess who/what the swarm is order for me to determine if I have given enough clues so you'll feel you should have guessed, but not enough to give away the ending. Please send your guesses tome via the CONTACT tab on my profile.

The Other Side of the Story

Chapter 3

Swarm Time

The Swarm was unique in its ability to perceive time over an enormous range. The limit for human perception is from about 1/30 of a second to a minute. A faster change is invisible and appears instantaneous. One that requires a period longer than a minute can be observed only by looking away and back. Considered against a scale from trillionths of a second to a billion years, these limits demonstrate that humans are virtually blind to the passage of time.

The Swarm with its dual sentience was also nearly blind to some events, even though the range of its perceptions, from millionths of a second to thousands of years, was vastly larger than a human's. Despite its range, events spread over an intermediate period of time were difficult to identify as to which were causes and which were effects.

That fact had been one of the reasons for the swarm's decision to create carriers IN THE BEGINNING.
