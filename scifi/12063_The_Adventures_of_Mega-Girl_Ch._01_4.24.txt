 Author's Note: The events in this chapter take place after 'How to Date a Superhero' and will make much more sense if you have read that 12-part story first. I decided to re-brand this saga because I realized the title no longer fits the direction I want to go. 'How to Date a Superhero' was probably a bad choice to begin with, as it doesn't encompass the heart of this saga â€“ which is really more akin to a comic book.

Now on to the story; I hope you continue to enjoy the adventures of Mega-Girl.
