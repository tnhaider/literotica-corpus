 Zak stared at Remi with raised brows. "What mission?"

Remi grinned, the bright overhead lights in Alpha 7's hangar glinting off his deep red hair. "A rescue mission." He turned to a wet, enraged Seth. "You in or not, Kitty-cat?"

"I will never become involved in one of your harebrained schemes," Seth spat shaking from fury.

Zak would have been pissed too if Remi had sobered him up by power-forcing him to vomit and then dropping a half ton ball of icy water on him. Just remembering Seth's body jerking in shock made Zak cringe.

"Rem," Zak sighed, "be a little more specific on the details of this rescue mission, bro."

Remi rolled his big green eyes with a long-suffering sigh. "Does no one on this space station trust me?"

"Not if one is sane, Red."

Zak turned to see Annie strolling up to where they stood.

Zak slipped an arm around her shoulders when she stepped up next to him. Her gaze swept over Seth and Zak tried not to snicker when she growled a bit, her gaze narrowing on Remi.

Remi scowled. "He was drunk. I was only helping sober him up for the mission."

Annie gasped and gave Seth a disapproving look. Before she could launch into chastising Seth about his behavior, Zak asked once more, "Remi, would you tell us who needs rescuing."

Remi's green-gold gaze blazed into Zak's. "Your witch."
