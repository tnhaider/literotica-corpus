--------------------------

Zahra was smiling as she watched all three of the Deadly Trio twitch then convulse again. "I have half a mind to not stop 'til all three of you are whimpering like the bitches you are!" Zahra almost screamed with glee. 

Panting Nuha grimaced as she threw dagger looks at Zahra. "You (pant) are the only (pant) bitch here! You are the one (pant) that left us to (pant) die on the (pant) battlefield. I..." 

A look of anger crossed Zahra's face as she drew up next to Nuha making curios designs in the air. "Master Jake!" She said in Nuha's ear forcefully. 

Nuha growled as she pinched her arm, "I refuse you bitch!" Nuha almost shouted pinching her arm again. 

"Uh, uh, uh, I think not," Zahra then drew to Nuha's ear again whispering. "Just think of how good Master Jake's cock will feel buried so deep within you. Feel it throbbing, each pulse of his heart causing it to swell slightly in you. You want it to fill you over and over as he fills you again and again! Feel his seed as it shoots deep within you filling you to the point you can take no more!" 

"NO! By the great Jinn! Fill me Master Jake deeper! Faster, take me I am yours! I have to have your seed filling me! Take me I will always submit to you. No one will EVER keep us apart!" Nuha was screaming as her body was convulsing harder than she ever remembered except for her time with Master Jake. Then just as suddenly her eyes glazed over. 

Zahra look at Nuha's sisters as they also were in the throes of their own overpowering orgasms. "We have to have him buried in us again!" They were shouting their bodies thrusting as the front of their clothes were starting to become saturated with their juices. 

Zahra nodded as she saw that she had finally broken all three of their wills, though she had to keep an eye on Nuha. That one was by far stronger then she had first thought. 

"I can help you have him again." Zahra said as all three of the sister's heads snapped around to stare at her. 

"Please tell us!" Nuha begged her eyes now as glazed over as much as her sisters. "We will do anything!" 

"That is good," said another voice behind Zahra. "You have done extremely well Zahra," Marie told her. "With all three of them going after him I can foresee nothing to stop him from becoming my slave! I will teach that dog of a man to take what is mine! Especially protecting that wimp of an ex-husband of mine! After I have all of his Jinns out of the way even the Jinn council will have to bow to me!" 

"Mistress, they are very powerful," Zahra told her. 

"Yes I know, though with the great Jinn still imprisoned they shouldn't be a worry to us now." Marie said as she started to laugh. 

An evil smile crossed Zahra's features as she thought of the council doing her every whim. Then there was that bastard Master Jake for the embarrassment he'd caused her. She'd make him suffer the most after Marie finished with him!

"So tell me about this love magic," Jake asked of Rasmir. 

"It was as you humans say a double edge sword. The one who controls it can make any other fall in love with anyone else. They could also make the one that was the target of the controlled one fall hopelessly in love with whomever they wished. As protected as you are I'd say that the second choice would be that you would be attacked with." Rasmir told Jake. 

"Wait you said that the Great Jinn stopped it last time. With him released can't he do the same thing?" A perplexed Jake asked. 

"Normally yes, though with him being imprisoned as long as he was he needs more time out. Though powerful, it will take a bit of time for him to completely repower himself." Rasmir explained. 

Jake had been nodding as Rasmir talked, "so like all of the situations I have come up against I am screwed. Great! Just fucking great! I suppose that this is also in the legends?" Jake said a huge sigh escaping his lips. 

Rasmir blushed slightly as he nodded, "Though it was only a passing note after the main part of you restoring the jinn race. Not much else was written down." 

Jake was again nodding it figured, and then he looked at Rasmir closer. He then realized that the man was keeping something to himself. "Alright out with it. I know when you are holding back, there's something else, what?" 

Ramir was shocked a moment thinking that he had kept it hidden as well as he thought he had. "I..." Rasmir started. 

"Normally I'd have let it pass as I usually have some idea of what I am dealing with. Not so in this case, you though seem to have extensive knowledge of this. So either help me, or this is going to be over real damn quick," Jake told Rasmir making the older Jinn cringe a moment. 

Rasmir nodded his head bowed, "It has always been known that the Ever Last Master would have great love; for his Jinns and the Jinn people. What I heard was..." 

______________________________________________________________ 

Nuha was still trying to fight whatever that bitch Zahra had done to her and her sisters. Barely shaking her head she felt her head clear then quickly slip back to where Zahra wanted it. They were all flying toward where that bastard man and his Jinns were! She could already feel the pull of him what's worse it was stronger thanks to Zahra's magic! 

Against her will Nuha said, "He is near sisters! Soon we will be complete again when he fills each of us to overflowing!" Nuha started to fight harder as she saw the huge silly grins that were on her sister's faces. Reaching down she pinched her arm repeatedly feeling the control slip finding her voice she started to weakly chant maybe she thought, maybe. 

Jake was about to tell Rasmir and the council the plan he felt starting to form when he saw Rashala tense up. "What is it? What are you feeling?" Jake asked. 

"The Deadly Trio!" The both said in unison. 

Smirking Jake nodded, "Figures it almost falls along what I felt would happen next." 

A moment later both Gen and Rosalinda's eyes open wide. "Master Jake something is wrong!" Gen said when she had looked at Rosalinda and nodded. "It is the Trio but they feel led or controlled!" 

Jake turned to the council, "Go!" With that the entire council was gone in seconds. "Will you be able to keep them out?" 

"I'm not sure Master Jake their power is far higher than I have ever felt," Rashala said. 

Suddenly Akeesha, Gen, Rosalinda, Rashala, and then Amira started to glow. "It is bad father," came a combination of voices into one. "They have indeed been infected by the love magic. You are the only one that can resist and expunge the magic. Mothers do not fight them when they are here. Instead watch for the real enemy Zahra. Don't be fooled by her father, she is in almost complete control, except for you." 

Jake nodded as he tensed up preparing for almost anything that the Trio might do. A few minutes later Nuha appeared with her sisters. Powering up she and her sisters were surprised when they met no opposition. 

Between clenched teeth Nuha said in a whisper, "I detest you and your nothing but good attitude. I would as soon die in the worst pain there is than align with you; though in this case we have a common enemy. The magic she uses is far too strong..." Here Nuha started to pinch her arms rapidly. "She is coming I can only hold her off so long. Beware she wishes us to bed you then kill all of us in the throes of passion." 

Jake nodded as he looked to where he'd last seen all his Jinns. Appearing in a flourish Zahra's smile faded as she saw that Nuha was once again resisting her. The little whore! How dare she resist her! Making several strange figures in the air, Nuha screamed as she hit herself in the mouth!

Zahra's face twisted into a mask of hate as she felt Nuha slip further and further out of her control. Then suddenly she felt the huge pull of the man. Groaning she hit her own face. "You will not gain control over me again you bastard!" 

Jake smiled so that was how she had resisted the last time. Zahra was about to make more signs in the air when she felt both of her arms held. Then she suddenly felt as if she wanted, no she Had to disrobe for master Jake! Biting her lip 'til it bled she managed to wrench her arms away from Jake. "You've lost Zahra! Give up before you are destroyed!" 

"Never!" Zahra spit out like venom. "I shall never be shamed again beneath a male! All males will bow to me or they will all die I..." 

"We were lied to you self important bitch!" Jake heard another voice issue from Zahra's mouth. "Let me show you how it should be, as it can be!" Zahra started to convulse thrusting her pelvis hard toward Jake. 

"No you pathetic whore! I will never debase myself to another male as long as I..." Zahra said then was quiet as Al-Mazhab Appeared. 

"I see that you are still holding that against me." Al-Mazhab said. "As you held to your vows so did I. I couldn't no matter how beautiful I found you." 

Zahra stopped stock still her mouth hanging open as she could only stare at Al-Mazhab. "Yo... yo...you found me beautiful? Why didn't you tell me? I would have waited an eternity for you!" 

Shaking his head sadly Al-Mazhab looked into her eyes. "Would it have really made a difference? Had I told you I know you would have stopped at nothing to rid our dimension of Qistina. No, this would have completely destroyed the dimension perhaps the Jinn race. As did you, I also had a duty, one I could not forego." 

"Duty!" Zahra spit out like something bad. "It was your duty to make me happy! I was the highest elite of the palace! You knew that I would react this way yet you still remained quiet! I should have killed you back then, An oversight I won't make again!"  

Zahra's eyes started to glow red as her mouth drew tight. Powering up more she started to fire at the king with ever increasing bolts of fire and lightening. 

"Zahra stop this you are far outnumbered! Do not throw your life away for a worthless human for nothing!" Al-Mazhab shouted at her. 

"Nothing! You were my world, the universe to me! Don't you EVER tell me that my love for you was nothing! I will destroy you along with every male there is in both dimensions! Once they are gone all females will be free to be the superior beings they are!" Zahra screamed when she saw that her attacks weren't getting through. 

Turning to the struggling Trio she shouted, "come!" Then she was astounded when she saw all three of them hesitate. Making several signs she again shouted, "come!" This time all three faded. "All of you are dead! I will kill all of you!" 

As she also started to fade a huge bolt of energy hit her shield crushing it, then hitting her. "You WILL NOT hurt OUR master!" Several voices said as Zahra screamed a shrill sound as the bolt burned her beyond recognition. 

"You all will pay for this with your pitiful lives! No one hurts the great Zahra and lives!" Zahra was saying through severely burnt lips. 

All of Jakes Jinns appeared a moment later, "Master please don't put your life in such peril again! It took all I could not to fire upon her." Rashala said as they all were checking every inch of Jake to see if he was ok. 

"Thank the great Jinn," Jake heard Sheeka say a few minutes later. 

"Father," a young male voice spoke to Jake. "That was a very risky thing you did. Please father, you make all of us worry so for you." 

Jake nodded as he turned to Al-Mazhab, "I thank you for being here sir." Jake said as he bowed to the Jinn King. 

Several gasps sounded as Al-Mazhab returned the favor bowing to Jake. "I was more than happy to help Master Jake. I had thought that she had moved past this. As with Qistina I was wrong. Now I can see that I should have done more than banish her." 

Jake patted the big man on the back, "We all make mistakes. As I have started to learn it is what we do and learn from those mistakes that define who we are." Al-Mazhab's eyes went large as he thought that Jake might blame him somewhat for this current situation. 

Bowing low to the floor Jake could see that the king had slight tears in his eyes. "You are far kinder and wiser than I had thought you were at first Master Jake." Turning to his daughter Amira he nodded as he gently touched her stomach. "This one will make a great ruler one day." 

Amira's eyes also went wide as pride started to show on her face. "Thank you father. I hope so also."

What was left of Zahra appeared next to Marie startling the older woman. Dropping to the floor with a thud Zahra was in more pain than she ever remembered being in for the last five thousand years! 

Marie arose from her chair looking at the lump of flesh that was Zahra. "You didn't follow the plan as I told you to do!" Marie yelled. I told you to watch 'til they had him reduced to a willing piece of meat!" A groan from Zahra only made Marie madder. "Get the hell up, heal yourself! Disobey me again I might let you stay like this far longer!" 

The Deadly trio was still struggling to get free of the love magic Zahra had used on them. "They disobeyed..." Zahra started. 

"Oh?" Marie said as she walked to the Trio her ire rising. "MASTER JAKE!" Marie yelled at the top of her voice. 

"NO!" All three of the trio screamed as they all fell to the floor their hands within their sex; each trying to relieve the growing, burning need within their vaginas. "Disobey again; this will go on for an extended time. None of you will orgasm 'til I tell you." Whirling Marie got close to all three, "am I understood!?" 

Nuha growled as she tried to again to break free. "I will not..." 

"Then you will not ever have Master Jake again!" Marie said as Nuha drew a ragged breath. "I will let you die from your deep need for him I will never let you go to him again!" Marie smiled an evil smile as she whispered the words Master Jake to Nuha 'til she fell to the floor screaming. "You are not allowed to orgasm! Obey me!" Leaning down Marie stated Master Jake again four times causing Nuha to scream louder convulsing then she was unconscious. 

Looking at Nuha's sisters as they convulsed she grinned again, then turning to Zahra, Marie saw that the Jinn was half healed. "As soon as you are healed I want you to start on the leader again I will not tolerate her disobeying again. I have already ordered her that she will die, never allowed to orgasm again." 

Zahra's half healed face smiled a wicked smile not being able to orgasm WAS a death sentence to a Jinn like her! Nodding her head she had to admit Marie had been right in all the plans she had made recently.

Jake had just sat down when Mary, Juno, and Nyrae appeared with her and Jake's baby girl. "Hello father." The baby girl said. "We know that you are busy so we won't take long." 

Jake nodded, "You both want a name for you." Jake told the girl and her mother. 

"Yes, any name you give will be cherished father." The little girl said. 

"I have been thinking as I did with Qaseem." Jake started. "I think that a Jinn name would be better for all of my Jinn children." Turning to look at the baby in Nyrae's arms he smiled. "I have seen the name Tilda all day." 

A wide smile broke out on Nyrae's face, "A beautiful name Master Jake!" 

"Yes, thank you father, like Qaseem I will wear it with great pride!" Baby Tilda replied. 

Jake nodded his head as he sighed if only everything was that easy!
