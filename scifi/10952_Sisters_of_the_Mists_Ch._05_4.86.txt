 Author's Notes:

This story is erotic fantasy, set in a world of magic. I reserve the right to be listed as the author of this work wherever it is posted. If found anywhere except Literotica.com with this note attached, this story is posted without my permission. © Darkniciad 2007

The villains in this story are truly evil, and their actions prove it. Some scenes may be disturbing for some readers.

I make use of modern weights and measures quite often in my work, because those are the weights and measures of my fantasy world. I know many fantasy readers prefer more archaic terms, and I hope those readers can overlook my use of miles, feet, and other such measures.

Please note that the form of witchcraft in my world is not meant to be true Wicca. Nor is it supposed to follow "Charmed" exactly. No offence or confusion is intended.

You should read the preceding chapters of this story in order to know the characters and what is going on. You will find that reading Book I of this story, Danica, will give you a lot of insight into the characters and the continuing storyline.

"It is good to see you fully recovered, Master," Ebonar said, as he rose to his feet.

"Dying and having your soul shot across the world can be a trying experience. I expected as much, having watched Camilla experience it," Zoraster responded absently, glancing at various mirrors and activating them with his thoughts.

"Will you resume your rightful place here, Master?"

"No. This plays to my advantage. So long as the world believes Zoraster Arias dead, they will fail to account for me in planning to counter my work." Zoraster waved his hand, and all the mirrors went dark. "You have done well in reviving the Guild of Death. The surge of power awakened my mind almost immediately when the first human pledged his loyalty to the Lord of Murder."

"I must say that you look well, Master," Ebonar noted with a smile.

"Indeed," Zoraster laughed, brushing at an imaginary spot on his robes. "Magic can only do so much to reverse the rigors of aging upon the body. I had no idea how much time had affected me until I awakened in this young body. Had I known, I would have purposely transferred my mind into this clone body long ago."

Zoraster stiffened and closed his eyes. A smile spread across his face as he reached out with his senses to touch magic put in place some time ago. When he opened his eyes, he said to Ebonar, "You will have another visit from Meckataur's pawn, soon. Another of his spawn has matured."

"They will be fine tools, Master."

"Tools I will not underestimate, as I did Danica," Zoraster said in low voice, with his brow furrowing. "Gather my most learned students of the True Runes. I have a task for them. Inform no one of my revival."

"It shall be so, Master."

Reappearing in the manor, Danica looked over at Marlena and asked, "Are you sure you're okay?"

"I'm just a little shaken up. I never would have believed a mere woodland troll could ignore my illusions so easily," Marlena answered.

"It must have been those blessed amulets. Just learn a few more offensive spells, and you'll be fine." Danica gestured for the other redhead to follow, and then continued as they walked, "We could make you some wands as a backup, until you're comfortable with your own spells."

"That's probably a good idea," Marlena agreed. "Are we going to the girls' wing?"

"The others are waiting for us there," Danica replied. "They're looking for those demons in their family books."

"At least my spell worked against the minor demons," Marlena said in a dismissive tone.

Danica pursed her lips, and then said, "We need to figure out some way for you to carry your artifact with you, without affecting its magic. With that boosting the power of your illusions, I doubt even the greater demons would have been able to penetrate them without being prepared ahead of time."

They reached the common area of the girls' wing then, to find the clones were painting each other's nails, and fixing each other's hair. Danica chuckled, but didn't otherwise react to how outrageous the styles looked. She also noted how much the clones were maturing, to have reached this stage of development. Only three months ago, they had the minds of five-year-olds. Now, they were rapidly moving toward a teenage mindset.

Remembering her teen years, that worried Danica a little.

Andrea piped up, "Come look. We've found all the demons."

"Good. Now we'll know what we're up against," Danica remarked, moving over to sit down with the gathered witches.

"First things first, their common abilities," Celes said as soon as Danica and Marlena sat down. "They can all teleport, with very few restrictions. Distance, and even dimensional barriers have little bearing on that power. Ashley blocked them with some charms she'd put out, or they'd have been on us a lot quicker than they were."

"They'll all be able to hurl fire, as well. That power is nearly universal with greater demons," Ashley added.

"They can also absorb the powers of demons – or witches – in some cases, by killing them," Edna warned.

"Then there's the obvious danger from all the claws, horns, hoofs, and wings," Celes continued. "They're all ridiculously strong, so we certainly don't want them to get close to us if we can help it. Your turn, Andrea. The first one is from your book."


Andrea turned her family book so Danica and Marlena could see it. "The fat, ugly one has mental powers. It can read minds, use telekinesis, and possess people. It can also let out smells that can affect a person's mind – or just smell really awful."

Edna interjected, "We're in good shape with the Korplenz demon. They're extremely vain, and rarely absorb other powers. Since it believes its powers are so superior, it will be at a disadvantage. Everyone here is used to telepaths, thanks to you and me, Danica. Any of you will be in a better position to recognize its mental intrusions because of that." Pointing at Danica and Celes, Edna continued, "You both have telekinetic powers, too, which can combat that power better than anything else."

"There's also a vanquishing potion in my book," Andrea added, grinning.

"Okay, now on to the hunchback. He was in my book." Celes replaced Andrea's tome with her own, pointing to the picture. "Banreez have power over sound. They can deaden it, or amplify it. A scream from a Banreez can burst your eardrums, or even be focused into a wave of force. They're also extremely agile, and their claws are coated in some sort of poison, which makes it hard for your body to respond to your thoughts. They're not supposed to be very smart, according to my book."

"The last was in my book," Edna explained, moving her volume into the center of the table. The picture she pointed at appeared to be some sort of twisted combination of man, ape, and troll – exactly as the demon had looked when they'd seen it in the desert. "It has power over light, and thus darkness. The darkness it creates is hard to pierce, even with magic. It can focus light into a burning beam as well. Like the Banreez, Prizart demons aren't very smart. Other than the Korplenz and Rexxus, the demons are fairly low ranking in the demonic pecking order."

Danica observed, "So, that means that either the elves aren't considered much of a threat..."

"Which I doubt," Edna interrupted.

"Or, they aren't there to actually attack," Danica finished, nodding her agreement with Edna's thoughts on the matter.

"There are vanquishing potions for those two, as well," Andrea said, tapping the ingredient list in Edna's book.

"They might not work, though," Ashley explained. "That's why I needed a drop of Rexxus' blood for my vanquishing potion. He's gained too much power to be vanquished by a common potion. Rexxus is a Hylaric demon, one of the more dangerous types. They're very intelligent, and can attack with fire, blasts of dark energy, or poisonous clouds of breath. Rexxus has also absorbed the powers of other demons. He can move as fast as a Warrazar – a speed demon – and his touch can age you – or kill. He may have other abilities, but those are the ones I know of. Nothing except this potion," Ashley said, holding up the red vial, "can possibly vanquish him."

"I don't know about that," Edna suggested with a grin. "A spell cast by the three of you could very well destroy him. The bond growing between you is no small thing, and demons will learn to fear it."

"We should get started on the potions, then. Now that we know what they can do, we can fight them," Celes advised.

"Not just yet," Edna argued. "I can't explain, but you should wait to strike against the demons for two more days."

"What's going to happen on the full moon?" Ashley asked.

"Not just the full moon," Edna countered. "You'll be better prepared if you wait. Just trust me on this. That doesn't mean that you can't gather up all the ingredients, so you'll be ready."

"Edna reads the signs that govern a witch's powers better than anyone. I think we should listen to her," Ashley suggested.

"And you know far more than either of us do, so I'll take the advice," Celes agreed.

"If they're allied with Rexxus, they're minions of Meckataur as well. That makes them doubly dangerous. For some reason, demons in his sphere of influence are far more powerful than others," Ashley advised.

"We've been warned about Meckataur and his spawn," Danica confirmed. "If we can do something to combat his rise in power, we need to do it. Zoraster's schemes are bad enough, without adding a powerful devil to the mix."

Celes sat back, tenting her fingers in her lap. "It's only little things I heard, but Meckataur may be mixed up with Zoraster as well."

"All the more reason," Danica said. "That reminds me – Christi gave me some reports to look over. Between the two of us, we might remember some things about Zoraster's plans that could relate to them. Will you come look over them with me?"

"Of course," Celes said, standing up.

"And we'll start teaching you some of the things your mother didn't get to show you, Andrea," Edna said, leaning over to pat the blonde's shoulder.

Denise, one of the clones of Danica, approached the women as Danica stood up to leave the room with Celes. She glanced back over her shoulder at the rest of the girls, and several waved her forward emphatically. Her face flushed with color, but she walked up to Danica and asked, "Are you going to make us toys?" She then cast her eyes downward and laughed sheepishly.

"Toys?" Danica asked, her eyebrows raising.

Celes looked over at the redheaded clone and said, "How in the... Never mind, I already know. Are you peeking into our heads again, Denise?"

Sticking out her lower lip, Denise replied, "No. Well – maybe a little. I didn't do it on purpose."

Celes rolled her eyes and chuckled. "I'll explain later, Danica. Just tell them you're going to."

"Okay," Danica said, with obvious confusion in her voice. "I guess I'll be making you toys, then."

Denise nodded, and walked back to her siblings, who erupted in a chorus of giggling.

"You'd better explain this to me first, before we get started on the reports," Danica said to Celes. Glancing over at Andrea, who was blushing furiously, she added, "I'll wager Andrea knows what's going on too, but I'll drag it out of you."

"Come along then," Celes laughed, and turned to leave the room.

Danica followed, shaking her head, and wondering what she was getting into now.

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****}

The cadaverous necromancer watched as the woman screamed. A nude, perfect duplicate of the terrified woman hovered over her, leaning closer, and shuddering in apparent ecstasy. The whore's screams trailed off, even as her flesh shrank against her bones. When the process was complete, nothing more than a dried husk remained of the dead prostitute.

Another necromancer, in charge of the transformation, ordered the newly animated Arian, "Go to your place and perform your duties, until you are given other instructions."

Slapping her rounded bottom, the beautiful creature laughed, and then sauntered toward the stairs leading upward into the house of ill-repute.

Turning to his superior, the necromancer in charge of the magic said, "She is the last. We will leave for the next location immediately."

"None have been detected?" The cadaverous leader of the death mages asked.

"No, Master."

"Good. Transport all the corpses as soon as this one rises. Send your subordinates to prepare at the next location." Without further comment, the master of the necromancers teleported away.

Back in his underground lair beneath the complex of Zoraster Arias, Klarr bowed his head respectfully, and activated the magical mirror before him with a thought.

"Report," Ebonar's voice sounded from the mirror.

"We have accomplished our goal, without detection."

"Excellent. A full score of Arians within Freeland itself. Your minions will move to the next location immediately?"

"Yes, Master. The remains will arrive here as soon as the final female has risen as the undead."

"Report to me again when the next house of whores has been converted," Ebonar instructed.

"It shall be so, Master."

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****}

"Excellent," Zoraster remarked as he sat sipping wine, just out of range of the mirror's vision. "Confine this intrusion to the outer edges of Freeland, for now. We will attempt to penetrate the capital and Egoria, later. Continue with the effort to infiltrate Egoria's tightly knit society of cutpurses and murderers."

"As you wish, Master," Ebonar responded, bowing his head.

A chime sounded, and Zoraster inclined his head, sensing through the magic who awaited outside the heart of his empire, begging admittance. "Ah, my rune scholars. You have the instructions committed to memory, I trust?"

"Of course, Master."

"I will be in my manor, in Varn. Bring the fruits of their labors there when completed."

"I will do so immediately, Master."

Speaking the words of a spell, Zoraster vanished from his chair, to reappear within the aforementioned manor. One of his nearly mindless clone servants awaited outside the door of the portal room, as they always did. "I shall be staying for some time. Make this place habitable again."

"Yes, Master," the beautiful brunette replied in a somewhat wooden voice.

Smiling wickedly, his manhood rising beneath his robes, Zoraster added, "As soon as you have informed the others of my return, attend me in my bedchambers."

There was none of the dry, wooden tone in her voice when she replied, "Mmm, yes, my Master," and pinched her nipples through her blouse.

"The small pleasures in life," Zoraster muttered, watching the clone quickly walk away. When she vanished around a corner, he went immediately to his bedchambers to await her return.

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****}

Danica finished writing down the final connection between the reports, all of which she and Celes believed were linked to Zoraster. "If we're right, he has his hands in everything from the lowest pickpocket, right up to royalty, all over the continent."

"The Duke and Duchess saw part of it, but seeing all this together, I can see where they missed some of the connections," Celes agreed. "Things are getting worse. Are Freeland and Egoria preparing for this?"

"Egoria is, as best they're able, without causing a ruckus amongst their neighbors. Freeland is taking small steps, but they refuse to commit," Danica replied.

"Damned idiots," Celes cursed. "This is plain as day, even when you don't know what we do. What could they possibly be waiting for?"

"Christi says that Freeland believes this can all be solved with diplomacy. They just don't understand Zoraster like we do. We'll just have to hope that Thakkorias can convince them to prepare for war. I should take this back to the Duchess as soon as possible, but I need to at least draw up some plans for Marlena's wands – and the toys for the girls."

"They're maturing quickly, aren't they?" Celes remarked.

"Yes, and I think you're right. Having some toys to take care of their needs will do them some good. They still turn to each other without thought right now. If I make the toys well enough, that should distract them a bit."

Celes broke out into laughter. "If they're anything like the ones you've already made, they'll do more than distract them. They are calming down a lot, though."

Danica nodded, and took a sip of her tea. "They're maturing, and becoming individuals. As they develop their own personalities, it will overshadow Zoraster's brainwashing. Fighting is actually a good sign, as crazy as that sounds. It means they're thinking of each other as people, and not just sex playmates."

"Odd that your clones are developing your mental powers, isn't it? Yours didn't come out until you ran into that Psi in Zoraster's counting house."

Danica shrugged, but then she crinkled her nose and said, "The only thing I can think of is that it's my touching their minds that has awakened their powers. That's when I found out about mine. I think I should have the girls help make their toys. If nothing else, they can help knead the air bubbles out of the clay."

"Not a bad idea. Helps you out, and gives them a little lesson about doing their share to get what they want."

Danica sighed, and sat back heavily in her chair. "I guess I should get started drawing up those plans for Marlena's wands."

"I'd really like to go sit in on witchcraft school with Andrea. I have just as much to learn as she does. I'll stay and help you, if you want me to."

Danica waved her hand in a short, dismissive gesture. "No, go on. I'm just going to get started, and then go put together something for lunch. I'll come get you when it's time to start cooking."

"There's something else we could try putting the girls to work at. If yours have half your talent, we'll be in good shape."

"You're just trying to get out of the domestic chores," Danica chided.

"Of course I am," Celes laughed as she walked out the door.

{*****~~o~~0~~o~~*****}

Danica awakened early, wet and breathing hard. She shivered one last time as the dream faded. Swinging her legs off the edge of the bed, she pulled her sticky panties away from her body as she stood up. She peeled them off a moment later, along with her nightgown, and slipped into a bath. All the while, she couldn't get the dream about Christi out of her mind.

Dried and dressed a short while later, Danica leafed through her notes. Despite taking the helm with both lunch and dinner, she'd found the time and inspiration to finish sketching out designs for Marlena's wands, and the basic outline of the toys for the girls.

Coming across some of her quick sketches for the toys brought Danica's dream back to mind. Pressing her fingers over her mound for a moment, she thought, Okay, enough already. I get the point.

Shaking her head, Danica muttered, "Okay, my hormones are really out of control. I'm talking to my pussy."

She knew it was partially the Awakening, enhancing her own natural desires. The point was that it only enhanced them, and didn't cause them. She, Marlena, Andrea, and Celes had been nearly celibate – even when alone – most of the time since they'd set foot in this valley. Odds were, they were all getting a little pent up.

Naughty thoughts about her friends swirled through Danica's mind then, with Ashley moving into the mix. The Duke and Duchess worked their way into the erotic daydream as well.

Shaking her head again, Danica realized that she wasn't going to get past the beast her need was becoming, unless she fed it. Speaking of feeding, I'd better get to the kitchen, if I'm going to be drifting off into daydreams all morning.
