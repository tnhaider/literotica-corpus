 I imagine you lying there on the bed

And me getting onto the bed

Tracing my fingers across ur legs...

In a zig zag swishy motion...

Slowly...

Slowly...

Two fingers walk up your leg

Sliding down into the inside of the soft fleshy thighs

The two walking fingers are now joined by two others who are pushing the leg apart who are trying to close down on the walkers

The fingers make slow twirls on the flesh digging just deep enuf to make u gasp

...they move up...

Tracing its way still upwards where it can feel the heat...

A heat so tremendous that it threatens to consumer everything in its path...

A heat so inviting to make one feel comforted...

The finger walkers are drawn... Drawn towards that moist soft heat...

The heat which makes them ache...ache enough to just feel one touch...

To grace across the tender...

To slide across the soft...

To touch the moist...

To kiss with their fingertips the beautiful lips...the wet soft lips...

The fingers are pushed back...away from the temple...

The fingers look back longingly but but but they cannot do their thing unless they are needed and the need has to be absolute... clothed in a yearning...

A yearning that can only be sated...

Sated only...

By the soft caress and embrace of the finger walkers...

The finger walkers eager to unleash the magic in their veins...

Turn back...

Skating across the smooth skin...

Leaving their imprints with each step they take...

They stop near the inside of the thighs...

Looking at where the need to go... No... yearn to go...

With trepidation and longing and excitement...

But one finger is hesitant...and dragging his feet,... He draws circles on the soft fleshy insides...

Unsure... how to proceed...

Not knowing...

If it will be welcomed where it wants to go...

... It is contemplating...wanting to turn back...

His brother ..stops him... looks at him... encouragingly...

"Cmon" he says..."U will like it"...

The scared one trusts his brother... And drags along behind him...

As they journey towards their destination... 

Dancing and twirling circles on the soft...flesh...

As they dance along... One of them slips and falls...

And the other in an attempt to save the first... Digs deep into the flesh...

Making the flesh go red in pain...

The fallen brother is pulled up by the one clawed in...

Taking care to pull him up...brushing the insides of the thigh...

Caressingly leaving the nerves on the soft flesh tingling...

The soft flesh t...t ingling and excited by the strange sensations...

The brothers' dance has given birth to...

The flesh shudders in anticipation... anticipation of what is to come next...

While... the brothers pull themselves together... n they march on...

As they near... They are afraid... yet want to trudge on... to the unseen temple...

Whence... suddenly...their minds are blow away... By the incredible... feelings coursing through them...as their nasal senses are exploded by the sweet fragrance of their destination...

Like a siren song... it draws them near...

Nearer... To the temple...

All the while dancing without realizing...

That they are now completely being engulfed by the...

Aroma of the elixir laying in waiting in front of them...

They reach near... And they notice that the flesh... Around the temple...

Is much softer where they are... now...

They are mesmerized by the sparkling of what looks like a million diamonds...

In front of them...confusing them... Only to realize that...

The moistness of the temple they are to enter is...what is sparkling...

Tantalizing...and...inviting...

One of the brothers...curious...slide across the opening...

Testing...

Feeling the moistness engulf him...

Drenched... He holds the temple opening and shakes himself...head to toe...

To remove the droplets...clinging on to him...

And suddenly the temple shudders...

Closing its opening on the brother still standing there...

Holding him tight... 

Not letting him go...

As he wiggles and twists...to no avail...

The other brother horrified... Climbs carefully on top of the temple dome...

And pushes against the soft yet hard mound at the top...

Of the temple... and pulls on his struggling brother...

The one inside trying to push himself out...

But each push and pull motion...

Only striving to push the brother inside...deeper...

Who by now is thrashing... Inside with all his might touching...

The even softer...

And even moister...

Sides of the temple...

The brother outside pulls hard...

At his brother...

Pushing his entire weight against the mound...

As he pushes harder... He is surprised at...

The intensity of the quake beneath him...

Shuddering and throbbing...

Causing him to fall into the opening which...

Gaped open momentarily to... Swallow him...

To place him next to his other brother...

The 2 brothers trapped inside the tight tunnel of the temple...

Wiggle and wriggle even harder...

Trying to push themselves out...

And no sooner are they just out when they r drawn back in again...

And this goes on n on...

Each motion... increasing in intensity with the need to...

Push oneself out...

While the tunnel becomes even more slippery...

Causing them to slip and be drawn back again...

No sooner are they in... That they push themselves out again...

When the temple's magic causes the brothers to slip and be drawn back again... 

... And in this state remained the brothers... The strange magic of the temple... Causing them...

To sway in and out of the tunnels...and with increasing speed... they keep going...

In...

And...

Out...

In...

And...

Out..

Trembling...

Pushing...

At the walls...

Inside...

Faster...

Harder...

Wanting to go out...

But yet...

Wanting to...

Stay in...

The moist...

Wam tunnel...

Which now is...

Shuddering and throbbing...

And gushing...

With the juices...

Of the elixir...

Which now has released its dams...

To pour forth...

In an intense...

Climax...

Throwing the brothers out...

With force...

Who now claw... At the opening... Yearning to get back in...

They slide their moist... wanton bodies against the opening of the temple...

Pressing in need...

In pain... .of not being inside anymore...

In pleasure... Of the exquisite smell surrounding them...

In feeling of the comforting wetness around their bodies...

...they yearn...looking to get a way in...

When... They sense a weakness in the temple's magic...

The opening failing to close in time...

Sensing their moment... they seize it...

They push through again...

Slithering their bodies inside...

As they are now one with the temple...

Moving in tandem...

In a rhythm... That...

Now feels familiar...

No longer new...

The brothers explore the...

Insides of the walls...

Trying to reach the...

Spot...

The spot where the elixir resides...

Tentatively prodding...

They move around...

Swirl around...

Breaking into their finger dance...

Circling...

Tiny circles...

Tracing large circles...

With their magic feet...

Changing direction mid-way...

Causing another shudder...

Revealing momentarily...

The Spot...

Which is more than what the brothers wanted... the tiny window of opportunity...

Is enough for the brothers...

As they reach out to the spot...

The spot where the elixir resides...

The holy grail...

They feel it... Begin...

Touching it...

Caressing it...

Pushing it...

Pulling it ..

Nudging it...

Teasing it...

And they feel the change inside the temple...

As they feel the walls close in on them...

When suddenly with a roar they feel the juices of the elixir released from its dam...

In one fell swoop... Engulfing them...

This time they hold on...

While they keep pushing... n prodding... on the spot...

When finally the gush of juices coming out...

Is too much even for their strength...

Taking the brothers out... In one single smooth motion...

Panting... Where they lie down...drenched...

They get themselves up... And...

Look on longingly... As they make their way back...

To where they came from...

Treading gingerly... On the soft flesh...

Sad for the time that have now come to pass...

... the sweet fragrance of the temple...

Wafting after in their wake...

...
