 This is Part 1 of a five part story and follows the adventures of Ginny, a girl with an unusual psychic ability.

This is a much longer and more complex story than anything I've attempted before and a huge thank you must go to ArilynWriter for her feedback, encouragement and editing: she is a star!

The other parts will follow in due course and any and all feedback and comments are very much appreciated.

PROLOGUE

She is asleep. She lies tangled in the sheet, her arm above her head and her beautiful breasts exposed. The glow of the laptop screen reveals a slight sheen of sweat on her skin; it is a hot, humid night, which is why I am sitting here unable to sleep. In the corner the radio softly plays old hits.

We're still on the move; never feeling safe and moving on every few weeks, taking whatever casual work we can get. Still, my knowledge of British geography has improved immensely; I remember a test in Year 9 where we had to say in what counties various landmarks were located: the Hogs Back, Durdle Door, the Needles, the Devil's Punchbowl. I was rubbish and couldn't answer any of them, but after 18 months travelling I've seen them all.

The laptop is on the dressing table and I look at myself in the mirror. The laptop's glow illuminates me softly. My hair, for so many years a procession of startling and unnatural colours: blue, red, magenta, even green once, is now blonde. Admittedly still from a bottle of dye, but my natural colour (too dark to be blonde, too pale to call brown) is growing through. I stare at my face. Grey eyes that look tired, my nose with its round end, high cheeks with more freckles than I've had in years from the time spent outdoors recently, soft, full lips above my small chin. Sitting topless in the hot room I can see my boobs, nothing exceptional, but I note with a little pride that they're still firm even at nearly 28, aureoles only slightly darker than the surrounding flesh, the nipples that she so likes to suck and nibble are large.

Thinking of her, my eyes are draw to the reflection of the bed behind me. As I watch her sleeping, the radio DJ announces the next track: "The Eurythmics with When Tomorrow Comes". As the song begins, I am taken back to my teenage years and Dad's never ending selection of 80's hits. Now, however, I actually listen to the lyrics Annie Lennox is singing:
