Day 4

Friday

**New York City (U.S.A)** 

Northern America, Region 1

It's been four days since the first five human survivors and their nonhuman partners paired up together to survive. The five humans learned they were the last humans left and were going to be in charge of ruling their own regions. There was also news that twenty-one other humans were spread out in the other six habitable continents of the world. Though many of them were still unknown to the current five survivors at this time. 

In the meantime Benjamin Hatfield, a former member of the US Coastguard. And Thyia, a thick buxom grey elven woman who paired up with him, traveled together.

The both of them were traveling in the camper Benjamin had taken for himself days ago. For the time being, it was their home on wheels. What better way to travel than in a camper. 

"The maps of your world's civilizations are so difficult to understand, Benjamin. " Thyia said, looking at an old map of different countries in an old hardcover atlas book.

"That's the map of the planet Earth you're looking at Thyia. You have to keep turning the pages to find a map of the eastern United States. As a matter of fact Thyia, I don't need a paper map to know where I'm going. Everyone might have disappeared off the face of the world. But the infrastructure of my species has been left undamaged and unchanged. GPS works just fine on this camper's GPS navigator. But for how long, I'm not sure."

"Thyia, you told me that the last humans left on earth are tasked with repopulating the world with their nonhuman partners, right?"

"That's correct, Benjamin."

"And you also said that the last humans have to also repopulate their regions. Which region are we in?"

Thyia looked in the atlas book she had in her hands to find out where they were. She flipped through the pages and stopped when it came upon the map of North America. She pointed at the countries of The United States, Canada, and Greenland.

"These three empty countries are what make up our region. This is region number one."

"Wow! That's a big region, a really big region. And we're somehow supposed to repopulate this region all by ourselves? Do I even have enough sperm for that? Do you even have enough eggs for this enterprise?"

"You're troubled Benjamin, aren't you?" she asked. 

"That's putting it lightly sister. Troubled doesn't begin to describe what I am feeling right this very moment."

"Contrary to what you might believe Benjamin. Elves and humans can reproduce with each other and that's also including all subspecies of elves. But for some species of elves, conceiving a child from a human's seed or vice versa, takes a lot of attempts for it to be successful. Elven pregnancies caused by non-elven males carry the risk of ending in miscarriages. But luckily for you and I, the women of my species conceive with very little issue. Our pregnancies are quick and the birthing process is painless."

"Quick pregnancies and painless births," he repeated to himself. "Eve must be envying the women of your species so hard right now. Poor girl."

"Who's Eve, Benjamin?"

"She's the mythological mother of mankind. Adam, being the mythological father of all mankind. The next question is when should we start repopulating our region?"

"Whenever you prefer."

Focusing on the road. Benjamin was still uncomfortable with this new reality. 

"I know we're well past the whole 'did the world really come to an end'" phase. But I really need to know something from you Thyia. Are you okay with this? What I mean is, are you okay with saving your species by having sex with a human man like me?"

"I admit that I could never conceive of a scenario where I would willingly lie with a human man to procreate. If I had done so back in my world, I would have brought the ire of my elders down on me and my entire family. I would have been exiled for committing such an act with a human. But my subspecies is gone, Benjamin. And humans are down to less than two dozen surviving members. Think of it like this. If I do nothing, my species dies with me. If you do nothing, you fail to pass along your bloodline and you die alone. Which will leave your region open for contention for other breeding pairs." 

"I understand Thyia, really I do. But when you think about, the two of us don't comprise a huge genetic pool for possible genetic combinations for our future children."

"Benjamin, your species has six million years of genetic history flowing in your blood. But if you're so worried about a small genetic pool. Elves are twice as old as humanity in that regard. The lack of genetic combinations won't be a problem for our future children. So long as there is no incest involved."

"Okay, then what about food?"

"The animals don't appear to have been affected in your world. Whatever happened seemed to have ignored them entirely. Surely there is large game roaming about in less crowded areas of your region. That is where food for our sons and daughters will come from. And shelter shouldn't be hard to find either. And before I fail to mention this to you later on. Grey elves always give birth in litters."

"Whoa. No way, really? Lucky me." he said nervously. He rolled his fingers and re-gripped the steering wheel. He swallowed hard.

"Where are we heading Benjamin if you don't mind me asking."

"If I'm going to be ruling a landmass as large as mine. I think I need a seat of power to rule from don't you think so?"

"You mean like a castle?"

"Sort of, but not really Babe. Iâ€”I mean Thyia," he stuttered, "I didn't mean to call you that. I used to call my wife babe when she was around."

"Babe? What does babe mean?"

"Its a term of endearment that someone gives to his or her beloved after being together for a long time. It's a special...title reserved just for that special partner." 

"Oh, okay I see now what you mean now. If it brings you any sort of comfort, Benjamin. You can continue calling me babe if you'd like."

"If it's really okay with you Thyia, then I think i will. And to answer your previous question. We're headed towards the old seat of power of The United States; Washington D.C. The white house is located there. We can settle down when we arrive."

Thyia smiled at Benjamin. She placed a hand down on top of his lap. He blushed and smiled back at her, shooting her a wink as they continued to drive forward.

"Benjamin I think you may have something in your eye!" Thyia said innocently.

**Chilpancingo, Guerrero (Mexico)** 

Middle America, Region 2

Oscar and Menja were inside of an RV Motorhome during their travel. They were traveling on a major freeway through the state. Because Menja was totally nude before. He handed her some clothes for her to wear right after they introduced themselves to each other. Because she was the same height as a ten-year-old. She had to wear children's clothes which made looking and listening to her hard. For one, the length of her jet black hair was long enough that it reached the back of her feet. And half of it hung down one side of her face, covering her right eye. It made her look oddly and strangely cute. And secondly, it was hard to take what she was saying seriously while wearing children clothes.

"Are you still angry with me Menja?" Oscar asked her.

Menja was sitting cross-legged on top of the bed inside of the RV, with her arms crossed over her small chest. "Don't talk to me!" she yelled.

"Listen, I'm sorry about forcing you to wear those clothes. If you weren't wearing any clothes, I wouldn't be able to concentrate on the road. Your breasts and your exposed pussy would be bearing down on my thoughts every single moment."

"Whats wrong with my breasts and my pussy!? Their fun size, just like my round little plump ass!"

Oscar stifled back a chuckle to keep his focus on the road ahead of him. 

"I wasn't making fun of your breasts or any other part of your body, Menja. I was just pointing out that--"

"You think their small and that's an offense to me! TO ME! If his infernal majesty, Lucifer, were still here I would have reported you directly to him. Then I would have laugh maniacally watching you suffer in the twentieth ring of hell." 

"Whoa, twentieth ring? What's inside of that ring?"

"Its basically a big washing machine filled with blood, shit, and vomit. Oh! And animals guts for flavor."

"I'm glad I'm not in hell then."

"You may be glad your not in it. But I'm absolutely livid about what became of hell."

Menja levitated back towards to the front of the Motorhome.

"Ever since hell became vacant. All the fun came to a stop. The orgies. The gang-bangs and most fun of all, the torturing of legions of damned souls. And now its all gone. The fires are no longer burning as hot and as bright as they did before. You think the sun is hot Oscar, and you think it's bright? But the fires of hell make your sun look like a burning matchstick in the dark. I've been wishing for death before meeting up with you but it will never come for me because I'm deathless!"

Oscar felt a pang of sadness come over him hearing the infernal imp's story. 

"I can't believe I'm saying this to you. But I'm sorry for your loss Menja."

For a moment, the small infernal imp looked touched by his words. Even blushing slightly as her one exposed eye stared back at him wide-eyed. 

"I don't need your pity, Oscar. Had I been assigned to torture you in hell, I would have been you afterlife nightmare for all eternity."

"What's that supposed to mean? Are you telling me I was destined to go to hell?" he asked, worried.

"Normally I would not have been allowed to tell you your fate Oscar. But since there is no power overseeing hell at the current moment. I suppose its okay to tell you now. The choices you made up to this point in your life and the ones you would have made later on would have destined you for purgatory."

"I guess that isn't so bad when I think about it. After all, in the end, Heaven would be waiting for me after all my sins were purged in the holy fire. So what happens next from this point on?"

"First things first Oscar. Most of humanity may be gone, but that doesn't mean the fun is over. Far from it. Whatever did this seems to have a sense of a dark sense of humor. Every human has been paired up with nonhumans to repopulate the world with hybrids. Think of it like an Adam and Eve project. With you playing Adam and yours truly, playing Eve. Actually, if we're being honest, I will be playing the part of Lilith; Adam's first wife."

"Do you have any idea who or what is responsible for this mess then, Menja?"

"I might, then again I might not. Right now the only thing you can do is stop this vehicle. Take me to the back and start fucking my brains out. Afterwards, I'll get knocked up with like twenty or thirty kids and--"

"Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hang on just a second there. We're moving a little fast aren't we?"

"No, not really. As I was saying. After I give birth to twenty or thirty of your children, we'll change the landscape of your country forever. When we have sizable numbers, we will ravage the next region and take it for our own!"

"I don't know if I can do that Menja. And I don't mean that I can't find it in me to fuck you, not at all. It's just you're a demon, a female demon. And I'm a human man. If I laid with you, I would be damning my own soul to hell."

Menja stared blankly at Oscar for a moment. Then broke out in a deep demonic laugh that echoed inside of the RV, startling him. 

"Ahahahahaha. Oh, Oscar if only you knew how many times supernatural beings have taken a corporeal form to lay with mortals. For example, those beings the ancient Greeks called 'Gods' were nothing more than former angels of the rank of Lordships and Virtues. But it is easy how the ancients could confuse god-like beings for being actual Gods. They fell from the grace of lord baldy, but never became demons and so fully retained all of their heavenly powers and abilities. As for your fear of going to hell for laying with hell's last beauty. Hell is in need of a new Lord, just like your region of the world."

"But...But I'm a Roman Catholic and," Oscar began speaking, pulling out a Saint Benedict medal from underneath his shirt, "that would be offending God." 

"Aaah!" Menja screamed in horror and pain. She flew back toward the back of the RV, where she hid underneath the bed sheets. She hissed in his direction, refusing to come out from underneath the bed sheets until he put the holy medal away.

"Oops, sorry about that. Let's find a place where we can call home first before we can start making babies huh."

"Where ever it is, make sure its far away from holy places and sacramentals. I can't function properly if I am near these things. And I don't need to remind you that were in open competition with other breeding partners for dominion of the earth."

"Open competition? You told me it was just to repopulate my region of the world. Mexico, region number two. Why did you lie to me?!" 

"I didn't lie, I just withheld some information from you."

He parked his RV Motorhome beside an empty lot, right across from a small park. Turning around in his driver's seat. He stood up and walked over to Menja who slid her head out from under the covers, only to slip back inside when she saw him coming yo her. He reached for the cover and yanked it aside. She let out a surprised squeal and teleported in a way similar to a self-imploding fire burst, where she reappeared behind him and flicked his ear for fun.

The two of them kept this game of cat & mouse going up until Oscar used his saint Benedict medal and chain to restrain her. When the holy medal made contact with Menja's skin, it burned her skin with a sizzling sound that accompanied it. He grabbed her, threw her over his shoulder and slapped her fat little ass twice and walked outside of the Motorhome with her.

"Aaahh! Get this repulsive thing off of me Oscar!"

"Only after you tell me the truth! You got it! No more lies!"

"Okay okay! Just get this thing off me, please!"

Oscar looked around and sat her down on a park bench. He pulled his medal off from around her neck. Although her skin was burned, including the palms of her hands when she tried to get the medal off her neck. Her skin healed itself back in no time.

"I don't know for certain who it is that's responsible for emptying both of our world. But it's not your master, God, yuck even saying his title leaves a bad taste in my mouth. He was unaffected by all of this. Heaven, like hell, is empty with only him left behind. This being is equal in power to God, eck! It was the one who did this. It seems like the universe went through a reset at this being's command and it wants to start off with a new batch of humans and nonhumans. If there is light, there's also darkness. And everyone and everything in the light produces a shadow, Oscar. Everyone."

"So this is someone's idea of a game essentially? God hear my prayers, please help me."

"Hah! Don't hold your breath, Oscar. The old man might not have been affected by this himself. But even he can't fix this mess. Nyahahaha! God has lost I only wish Lucifer was here to celebrate with me!" she laughed.

Oscar let out a tired sigh and leaned back on the backrest of the bench. He tilted his head back and closed his eyes to try to process everything he finished learning. Menja pushed her long hair away from the side of her face and stood up on the bench. She stood between his legs and cupped the sides of his face in her small hands. She opened her mouth slightly, revealing a dark green forked tongue.

"What are you doing?" he asked her.

"Just helping you find peace for the time being."

Oscar wrapped his arms around her back and pulled her in closer. Their tongues became entangled with each other in a forbidden kiss. He ran his hands up and down her small back, stopping on top of her fat little ass to knead it.

**Corbel-Essonnes, Paris (France)**

Western Europe, Region 10

"Where exactly are we going, woman? And why do you have so many things inside of your mechanized mount?" Elred asked Roxane.

"To the presidential palace, Elysee Palace. It was the symbol of French leadership and power in the country. All those things you mentioned are supplies I gathered for my survival. I didn't know I would be pairing up with you." she answered him.

"It doesn't matter where you settle down at Roxane. The countries you call France, Belgium and The Netherlands are your lands now. They are yours to do with as you please. Choose a place where you feel comfortable ruling from. Prep yourself for motherhood, and let's start breeding."

"If all of these lands are mine. Then that makes me...a Queen. An empress even!?"

"There's no one else around to tell you that you're not. All I care about doing now is breeding and raising up our region's numbers."

"Fucking, you want to fuck. Is that the only thing on your mind right now!?" 

"Fucking?" he said confusingly.

"It means to fornicate. Reproduce to produce children. That's what it means in my language."

"Yes exactly! Let's not waste any more time then! Let's fuck!"

"Listen I know your angry and sad and maybe even a little scared about what happened to your kind."

"I'm not scar--"

"But you can't allow it to cloud your mind and judgment right now! I'm sorry about what happened to your people but let's try to keep all conversations between us cordial. Can you tell me about the other human survivors? Why can't I just get on a ship or plane and meet them?"

"When I appeared in your world, I fell from the sky. I don't know why but I just did. When I began to make my way toward the country of Switzerland, I was repelled back by an invisible barrier. It appears there are invisible 'bubbles' keeping breeding pairs inside of their regions for the time being. Whoever is responsible for this, doesn't want humans mating with each other humans. How else do you explain me? Why am I here instead of a human male? No, I think, for the time being, we're locked inside of our regions. Perhaps the eyes in the sky want to see what will happen next."

"What do you mean for the time being?" she repeated. "When do you think those bubbles might lift?"

"Whose to say. Perhaps they'll never lift. Or perhaps after we have produced enough children, and most of them have reached the age for marriage. Diplomacy can be established with rival regional leaders. Maybe then the bubbles will start to lift. We'll never know unless we try."

"It sounds like we've been thrown back into the medieval age of Europe with political marriages. Lords and Ladies. Kings and Queens dominating domestic businesses and foreign affairs. I never imagined myself ruling over anything larger than my own home. Now I have three empty countries to look after and build right back up. And somehow I'm supposed to fill this up with human and elf hybrids."

"Sun elves, dear. I'm not a common elf. I'm a sun elf, the cream of the crop of my species. You should be honored to mixing blood with mine. Now, stop your mechanized mount for a moment and let me help you ease your mind and body."

Maybe it was how softly he said it. Or maybe it was his soft expression and soft smile that made her do it. But Roxane stopped her car and turned to him. Elred brushed his long luscious blonde hair behind his shoulder while staring back at his reflection in her rear-view mirror. He turned to her and smiled. Despite some facial differences from the human men, she was accustomed to seeing. He was very handsome but still a pompous ass. 

Elred took her by her hand and gently eased her into what he had planned. The feel of his skin was soft like baby skin, which was strange because he looked so rugged and oddly wild looking. He was leaning in for what she took for a kiss. So she closed her eyes and slowly leaned forward to meet his lips with her own. He met her lips with his, slowly meshing them while pushing his tongue out to meet her in this short union of lips. Surprised by this display of gentle affection, she felt like she could let her guard down and cupped the side of his face as their kissing turned more intense.
