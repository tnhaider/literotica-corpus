Fire Drive, Castillo Residence

Arriving home just minutes before her husband did, Shayna prepared some food hastily. Her children who had already arrived earlier, each had keys for the house door and were safe even without either parent being home, when they got back from their respective schools. Their house had the latest energy barrier home defense system, so if a robber or other type of criminal tried anything funny., they'd be sent flying back with possible broken bones. On the menu for dinner was lasagna and steak plus fries as dessert. Shayna's children were all over the place inside the house, they were either running around and jumping up excitedly on the living room couch or playing hide and seek. All the children horsed around except for Gahji, who was in his bedroom working on his homework. Shayna never could find it in her to yell at her children, even if it meant calming them down some like most stern mothers could. If they were anything like her in the personality department, they would calm down and grow out of it when they were older like Gahji. Shayna heard the car engine of Nicholas's patrol car coming into the driveway. Nicholas parked the patrol car just behind Shayna's and turned the lights and engine off. He stepped out of the squad car and made his way to the front door of his home, but Shayna was already there to open the door for him. Seeing his smiling face once again, sent great relief throughout her mind and body. 

"Nicholas!" Shayna said happily.

"Sunshine!" Nicholas greeted her right back with equal excitement.

The married couple embraced, kissing each other deeply. Nicholas reached around down her lower back with his hands, to reach his favorite spot on his wife's body, and gave each of her round ass cheeks some well deserved slaps. Shayna giggled, biting down and pulling back softly on Nicholas's lower lip as she felt his hand gently caress each of her cheeks after smacking them. 

"Something smells good and boy am I hungry" Nicholas said, walking inside of his home and closing the door behind him.

Shayna lead Nicholas into the kitchen first before he could interact with his kids. When he was inside, she pressed him back against the kitchen counter top in a manner he was familiar with. Thinking Shayna wanted make out, Shayna leaned forward, but instead of meeting his lips with her own, she pressed the side of her face against his and whispered softly into his ear. 

"It happened to me again at work today, Nicholas" Shayna whispered softly but coldly.

Nicholas knew what those words meant. His soft, happy and relaxed face turned dark and serious. 

"Why didn't you call me Shayna? I would have gotten there quick, you know you just need to tell me to do it one time Shayna; and I will have that woman fired. I'll make it so that she'll never be able to work in any school ever again." 

"But I love my job as a teacher, Nicholas, besides, each time I arrive late she asks me if I love my job. That's a threat and she knows exactly how to bend me to her will. But the thing that hurts me most Nicholas, is that its happening in the same school Gahji is in. Even though she's taking advantage of me, I find myself becoming excited.,That's not normal is it?"

"You can't stop your body from reacting to a stimulating sensation. But if you feel deep down inside that you like how she treats you, then--"

"I don't like it, Nicholas! I hate it!" Shayna whispered a little louder and angrier, "I came home and brushed my teeth and mouth three times."

"Like I said Shayna, all you have to do is tell me and I will get rid of her, Okay?"

"Okay Nicholas, if it happens again, I will tell you" Shayna said, reassuing her husband.

Nicholas looked reassured and sighed, relieved, "So about tonight and our "appointment" with the Millers, whose going to look after the kids while we're at their place?" Nicholas inquired.

"How about Mike and Marvin?" Shayna suggested.

"Oh you mean M&M?" Nicholas asked.

Mike Reddy and Marvin Reddy, or 'M&M' as Nicholas nicknamed them the day he first met them, Was the gay couple and neighbors living next door to them. They lived on the left side of the Castillos, opposite of the Millers. Like the Millers, they too were a gay married couple, and like the Castillos they were also an inter-species couple. Mike was the human and Marvin, ironically enough, was the alien. Mike was an Indian-American man of 29 years and Marvin was a dark green skinned mariner, with black colored eyes, and who stood approximately six feet tall; definitely taller than the 5'5 Mike. 

"Yeah, M&M, they love the kids. They took care and babysat Hannah and Dov when they were small five years ago."

"Man, had it really been that long ago?" Nicholas thought out loud, "boy these hybrids sure grow up quick. Okay, let me go knock on their door and ask them right now" Nicholas said, walking out of the kitchen.

Nicholas walked past his two youngest children and stroked his hand on top of their heads on his way out. Nicholas walked out and headed toward Mike and Marvin's home, he knocked on their front door twice before Marvin came over and answered it. 

"Nicholas? My this is a pleasure, what brings you here?" Marvin answered effeminately, with Mike coming up behind him to see who was at the door.

"Hey Marvin, Mike. Listen, me and Shayna are going over to spend some time with Ramona and Janet and we need someone who--"

"Say no more, Nicholas. We love your children dearly, almost as if they were mine and Marvin's" Mike said, stepping in front of Marvin.

"Thanks you guys, you're real life savers you know that. You can come over at eight, which is the time me and Shayna are going to leave, See you soon" Nicholas told them, waving goodbye and turning around.

Mike turned to Marvin and told him softly, "That man sure is handsome and strong. If only he were a little bi curious" Marvin kissed Mike and chuckled at his wish.

And so Nicholas and Shayna ate in peace with their children at their dining room table. But the children, being as playful as ever made it anything but peaceful such as Fukayna and Rami who messed with each other by poking the other, or Azizi who made faces at her two youngest siblings. Meanwhile Gahji ate his food and drank his soft drink in peace, like his parents. Nicholas raised his voice at his three children playing, and told them that the dinner table was to be respected. His serious voice was all it took to get them to stop playing and focus on eating. Nicholas looked to his right side at Gahji and patted his hand on top of his head, smiling at him. Gahji smiled back at his father who looked happy with him and his maturity. At the end of dinner, Nicholas cleaned the plates and utensils, while Shayna cleaned the glasses they all used to drink from. Mike and Marvin came knocking on the door right on time. Shayna went over and answered the door. 

"Good evening Shayna" Mike and Marvin said, kissing her on each side of her face. 

"Good evening to you two as well. Kids! Me and your father are going over to the millers and stay there for awhile. Listen to Mike and Marvin while we're away, got it!" 

Shayna was flanked by Fukayna and Rami who jumped up and down, wanting to be picked up and held. Shayna giggled and picked each of them up and placed a warm soft kiss on their lips. Nicholas patted the heads of Gahji and Azizi who smiled up at him. Placing her kids back down on the floor, Shayna and Nicholas walked out of their home and made their way over to the Miller home hand in hand. 

**Miller Residence**

8:05 PM

Waiting outside of the door after pressing the doorbell button twice, the Miller's front door finally opened. Ramona was the one to answer the door and greeted the Castillos by kissing them on their cheeks and inviting them into her and Janet's home. Janet was a little further inside, and came over to Shayna and greeted her first before Nicholas. She kissed both of Shayna's cheeks and placed a light peck on her lips. Nicholas didn't mind this since he was with Shayna and knew there would be more to come. Janet looked past Shayna when she was finished greeting her and looked over at Nicholas standing behind her with a deadpan look on her face, and extended her hand for Nicholas to shake, which he did out of courtesy. 

"You two must be tired, please take a seat" Ramona told them, showing them to the couch in their living room. 

Janet walked quickly into the kitchen to fill wine glasses with wine for her guests and neighbors, then returned just as fast back to the living room to serve them each their glass. Ramona sat next to Nicholas and Janet sat down next to Shayna. While taking a sip from his glass, Nicholas felt Ramona caress hiss thigh, even squeezing it teasingly. Janet did the same to Shayna, who smiled back at her. 

"You two probably think we just invited you for a night of fun. That part is true, but the other reason we invited you was because me and Janet wanted a child. Not a hybrid mind you, but a New Human child, and in order for that to work we need a human man and a mariner woman. Now Nicholas you're probably thinking, why me? Why me and Shayna?" Ramona said in a goofy voice.

"Yeah, you're right about that " Nicholas told Ramona, sounding and looking very confused.

"Well Janet currently has baby fever and I told her I would be more than willing to carry the baby first, but we decided after much talking that she would carry our first child. I would carry the second child, but that's a year or two after our first born has had time to grow up. We chose you, or rather I did because you're genuinely a handsome guy, and we've known you and Shayna for seven years now. We get along well, we're friends and this will only deepen that friendship."

Nicholas blushed and looked back at Shayna, who boldly asked, "So what comes first, fertilization or the fun?" 

"Fertilization, without a doubt!" Ramona answered Shayna, quickly and excitedly.

"Okay then Nicholas, do you want to undress me?" Shayna asked him.

"Hold your horses for a second you two, let's not do this in the living room. Let's go to the master bedroom for this night of fertilization and fun" Ramona told them. 

**Master Bedroom**

Finishing up their glasses of wine first, the four adults walked upstairs to the master bedroom, closed the door and locked it behind them. Without wasting time, Nicholas began to undress Shayna who undressed him at the same time. Ramona liked the way this couple operated and mirrored the same thing with her wife, Janet. Nicholas and Shayna kissed each other, just like Ramona and Janet kissed each other. Nicholas had fully liberated Shayna of the last piece of clothing she had on her back, just like Shayna who all she needed was to pull down Nicholas's black boxer briefs to free him of his last piece of clothing. A hard seven inch, veiny cock sprang free as the boxer briefs fell flat on the ground. Seeing her husband's erect cock dangling between his legs caused Shayna to lick her lips with lustful anticipation which also made her pull him in over to her by his wrists and deep kiss him. Nicholas pushed his cock in between her closed thighs and thrusted back and forth, which also rubbed up against Shayna's moistening pussy. Ramona and Janet were naked long before Nicholas and Shayna, and while the inter-species couple kissed each other, Ramona whispered something into Janet's ear.

Nicholas and Shayna were too distracted with kissing each other to feel Ramona gently squeezing herself between them. Only when Nicholas felt a hand and fingers grip and start stroking his cock, and when Shayna felt two fingers pushing inside of her vagina, did they stop kissing to see Ramona kneeling down between them and grinning up at them. Ramona stroked and sucked Nicholas, then fingered and sucked and licked Shayna's fat blood engorged clitoris. Janet came up from behind Shayna and reached around to the front of Shayna to grab two handful of her breasts. Shayna let herself be ravaged by these two women as one finger fucked her and sucked on her fat clitoris, while the other kissed her neck, licked the sides of her face as she kneaded her breasts, including twisting and pulling on her nipples. Because Nicholas knew these two women and knew they were good people, he allowed himself to enjoy the sight and sounds of his wife being pleasured by two different women.

Janet grinded up against Shayna's large shapely ass, rubbing her own clitoris against the crack of Shayna's ass for her own stimulation. Letting Shayna go, Ramona watched Shayna turn around to kiss Janet. Ramona focused now more on Nicholas as their respective wives enjoyed and explored each other's mouths. Ramona cupped Nicholas's heavy scrotum with one hand, while she stroked and sucked on his cock, slurping it up and down like it was a tasty Popsicle. Nicholas thoroughly enjoyed the pleasure he was receiving from Ramona's wet lips and slick tongue, yet before he could cum inside of her mouth, Ramona pulled his cock out of her mouth with an audible gasp and crawled over to her bed where she rested the upper portion of her body on the edge. With her round black booty, that was as thick as Shayna's, wagging back and forth in front of him. Nicholas's cock throbbed, yet he also looked back over at his wife who was busy deep kissing Janet into oblivion. Janet smacked and spread Shayna's ass cheeks as she descended into lusty madness.

"Hey, Officer Castillo?" Ramona called out to Nicholas formally.

Nicholas looked back over to Ramona who was now laying down on her bed. "If you like what our wives are doing, how about coming over here and letting out tongues have a battle of their own?" Ramona suggested to him.

Nicholas raised a curious eyebrow at her suggestion. What Ramona said might have made Shayna jealous, who was quick to push Janet away from her and rush over to the side of her husband, who was making his way over to Ramona. Shayna stopped him in his track, pulled him in and kissed him. 

"Hey Shayna, he's mine!" Ramona told her sharply.

"He's My Husband!" Shayna told her, very possessively.

"But you looked pretty comfortable kissing Janet, Shayna?" Nicholas pointed out. 

"It was more than comfortable for me" Janet chimed from her angle with silly smile on her face.

"I thought you and Ramona were already kissing, that why I did it. Is kissing out of the question?" Shayna replied.

"No. But you can't get jealous of me if your tongue is halfway down inside of Janet's throat, right? I wanted to tell you while you were kissing Janet, that I wanted to get to fertilization first before fully enjoying each other."

Shayna jumped up and down excitedly and pulled Nicholas over to the bed. Ramona called Janet over who crawled into bed with them. Ramona leaned back on the wall at the head of their bed, and propped herself up by her elbows while letting Janet lay her head down on top of her groin. Janet laid down in front of Shayna with her legs spread open. Shayna bent herself forward on top of the edge of the foot of the bed. In this position, Shayna had access to Janet's clitoris and wet pussy and lowered her head between her two open thighs. Immediately, Shayna ate Janet out at her leisure as Nicholas stroked his saliva covered cock some more, enjoying the sight in front of him for a little bit.

"Mmmmnn, oh fuck! Mmmmnn get it Shayna. Eat that fucking pussy!" Janet hissed at Shayna through gritted teeth. 

"How does her tongue feel baby?" Ramona asked Janet, watching. 

"Oh god! It's-It's the best. It's the—OH FUCK! It's like there's a long slippery snake inside of me Ramona, whipping around and hitting every fucking spot!" Janet shouted, grabbing the sides of Shayna's head in an excited manner. Janet rolled her hips and rubbed her pussy all over Shayna's mouth ever more quickly and ecstatically. 

Ramona glanced back over at Nicholas who looked frozen just watching his wife and her wife going at it. Nicholas slowly stroked his cock and seemed content to just watch. "Hey Romeo! Anytime tonight would be nice" Ramona said loudly, snapping Nicholas out of his self induced trance. He pushed the slick head of his cock past his wife's outer wet labia, till he was fully sheathed inside of her burning hot vagina. 

"Oh my god, Nicholas! Mmmnnn fuck..." Shayna moaned approvingly, finally pleased to have her husband inside of her. 

Finding a steady tempo that worked for all three of them, Nicholas pounded his wife's pussy. His hands firmly clamped down on her hips for support and he had to bend his knees slightly, since his wife was not that tall. 

Clap* Clap* Clap* Clap* Clap* Clap* were the sounds of Shayna's ass cheeks slapping and rippling back against Nicholas's thrusting groin. 

"God look at that thick juicy ass just jiggling! Mmm, fuck Nicholas, that's right beat that pussy up boy! Beat it up right!" Ramona commented, giving Nicholas some compliments.

"Tightest fucking pussy and asshole on the whole planet," Nicholas panted in between thrusting, "Mmmmnn, after six...Uunhh...Children, Shayna's still as...Oohh fuck...Tight as the first day we consummated our marriage" Nicholas grunted and panted.

Nicholas pumped into Shayna harder and faster as Shayna could feel Nicholas's first out of many orgasms about to come. Janet kept her hands firmly planted down on top of the back of Shayna's head, making sure to finish pleasing her before focusing her attention back to her husband.

"That's right! Get in there...Good girl...Good girl! Huhn, huhn fucking eat me baby! Eat me!" Janet hissed pleasingly down at Shayna who kept thrashing her tongue about inside of Janet's sopping vagina.

Clap* Clap* Clap* Clap* Clap* Clap* "Oh Fuuckkk, Uuuunf!!" Nicholas groaned, thrusting harder and faster against his wife's ass that clapped ever louder.

In an instant, Shayna was trapped in between the greatest show on earth. In front of her, Janet sprayed and squirted inside of her mouth and on her face. Behind her, her husband came, pumping her womb with ropes and ropes of hot white cum. Shayna pulled her face away from Janet's spraying cunt to catch her breath. A waterfall of Janet's juices dripped out the sides of Shayna's mouth, who turned to look behind her at her husband pressing his groin firmly against her round ass until he was finished cumming inside of her. A good minute went by as Shayna and Janet had caught their breaths. 

"Damn boy, you need that much time to finish cumming inside of Shayna?" Ramona asked Nicholas curiously.

"What's it to you? It's not your womb he's filling up, Is it?" Shayna said, defensive of her husband's time ejaculating inside of her.

"Chill Shayna, i was just curious. Does he cum like a horse or a bull?" Ramona asked, changing the subject. 

"Like an elephant, Mmmmnn" Shayna answered teasingly.

"Seriously?" Ramona wondered. 

Nicholas was finally finished and pulled out of his wife's stuffed pussy. A string of cum and juices dangled between the lips of Shayna's labia and Nicholas's cock, till it split apart when Nicholas fully separated from her. Shayna straightened up from bending forward on the bed, resting back against Nicholas's chest who held her close to him. 

"I need at least thirty seconds to get this right," Shayna told Ramona and Janet, "I don't really get too many opportunities to do this so you'll have to forgive the time needed."

"It's alright baby, take your time and focus" Nicholas whispered beside her head, kneading her breasts while resting the side of his face in the crook of her neck. 

In the meantime, Ramona reached around to the nightstand beside her and opened a small drawer. She grabbed a condom packet and threw it to Nicholas. "Nicholas, heads up!" Nicholas glanced back at Ramona and grabbed the condom packet she threw at him.
