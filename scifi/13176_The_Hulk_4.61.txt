 It was first detected at eleven thousand parsecs from the outpost world of Vegan. Just one of several thousand anomalies recorded on the planetary sensors that day. Bored technicians and overworked scientists tracked its progress in a haphazard fashion, until it became apparent that it was moving in a direct path towards the planet. Still, it had been approaching for weeks before a young man noticed that it was making minute course corrections so that it wasn't just approaching the planet, it was adjusting to stay on a collision course. 

Calls were made, people informed, debates were held and still it came on, a silent streak in the merciless void. No one knew quite what to do. Alarmists demanded that the Terran Authority be called in at once. The planetary governor, wary of crying wolf to the less than forgiving authority, hesitated. It wasn't until June 19th, when it entered the system, that he finally placed the call. The authority, already stretched thin covering the growing empire, dispatched the ageing Destroyer Gavin. She arrived a month later to find the planet deserted. Well, deserted wasn't quite right, scientific tests confirmed what sickened marines reported. Vegan hadn't been deserted; it had been sterilized. Not even microbes remained. And it? It was on the move, headed for the small colony on ProserpinaV.
