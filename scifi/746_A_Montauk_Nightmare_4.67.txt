 Sleep with one eye open

Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light

Enter night

Take my hand

We're off to Never Never-land

Enter Sandman, Lyrics by James Hetfield

JENNIFER

Can't... breathe!

I hurled myself upwards in bed, yanking in deep lungs full of air through my mouth. My sinuses and head felt twenty pounds heavier and pain was thundering through my skull. Strings of numbers raced through my consciousness, pushing away all attempts at rational thought. I clung to them, desperate for something familiar and stable. Sequences, formulae, bits of order in a sea of chaos.

Still half asleep, I was instinctively pushing and slapping at Finn's shoulder. 

His arm closed around me, holding me to him tight. His own heartbeat was rapid, but as he held me, my pulse's manic rate slowed to meet his. My breath steadied. I reached my hands to my face, pawing at the sweatâ€”

My palms came back dark. Not sweat. Blood.

The reality of my dream crashed into me. I'd seen it before, been there before. Felt them before...

"They're back. Finn, they're back!"

Searing pain, like a ripping and tearing of my mind.

Blackness.
