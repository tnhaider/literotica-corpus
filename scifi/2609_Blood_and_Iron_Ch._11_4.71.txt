I looked carefully into the drawer before reaching, in but there was no obvious snare. The drawer was completely lined in deep pile to prevent "hollow sounds" from revealing this void, as well as preventing movement and muffling sound from the three small leather bags the drawer contained. Opening the bags, I dumped the contents on the top of the large chest.

What is it with these people and snakes!?! 

The signet ring was a hooded cobra motif, with a large marquis cut star sapphire of a rich blue coloring. Next was an ornate skeleton key, with a cobra and sapphire gem set in the bow. Then another "key," with its sapphire and cobra bow and its blade consisting of a short, pencil thin square shaft ending in a "cross" point, akin to a Phillips screwdriver but not pointed. I sat back on my heels as I studied my find. Then it dawned on me what this was about. 

These primitive locks with their skeleton keys almost fall open with any kind of key, and were dead easy to pick with the simplest tools. One defense of the time was subterfuge. 

My guess was that this lock was outsized with ostentatious decorations and ornate engraving. To open it, the key goes in the obvious keyway, then the minuscule screwdriver key would be inserted into an insignificant opening concealed by embellishments, and turned to actually open the lock. 

Now that I had the keys, it was "only" necessary to find this cobra sapphire lock. 

Since the puzzle box was here in the possession of the robbers, the owner or person with best information was probably dead! Given the traffic on the main road the robbers preyed on, "my" lock could be anywhere from Coast Castle to King Holm. 

I smiled grimly. One more mystery to layer on top of all the others.

Putting the ring and keys back in the leather bags, I replaced them in the drawer of the puzzle box. I closed the drawer, carefully returning the wooden laminations to their original locked condition. The puzzle box then joined the rest of my loot at the bottom of the ladder. 

I tossed a handful of assorted coins into my belt pouch, with another assortment going in my concealed money belt. Finally, with a last look around, I began handing my booty up the ladder.
