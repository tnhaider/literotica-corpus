 Author's Note:

I'm not really sure how to react to the massive wave of support for my writing. Thank you very, very much.

A few people have asked me if I could give more regular updates on the progress of Dream Drive; many of the same have wanted to know if I've written anything else. The answer to both of these questions is yes. Please see my note at the end of the chapter for details.

Let it be known to all that my editor, Expoh, suffered through my typos so that you might be spared.

All aspects of the story are fictional. All characters that participate in sexual activity are over the age of 18.
