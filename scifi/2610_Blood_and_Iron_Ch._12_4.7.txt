If the eyes are the windows of the soul, Princess Veronica had the shades down, drapes drawn and shutters closed. I was getting nothing from hers. Softly I said, "I gave my word, your grace."

"Even knowing you could not keep it, Hunter?" she asked, in that same cool cadence with no expression. 

I nodded as I agreed. "Yes, your Grace, knowing that I did not speak for anyone but myself, but knowing even more that I wish Donna to live. She told me much…"

One eyebrow came up just fractionally as she interrupted, "But they are dead."

I shook my head, saying, "No, not all. There is 'something'. Far more than robbers, Princess, and I want Donna, who has some knowledge of this 'something,' to accompany you on the rest of your journey."

Into her palpably quizzical silence I forged on, "It is not highwaymen or isolated thievery, your grace. Some agency is making widespread disorder. I do not know who is responsible or the purpose of this chaos, not yet. I have 'not yet' the full knowledge that I need. This unknown something is a danger to the kingdoms, and especially to you."

I took a deep breath, saying forcefully, "I am convinced, your grace. Nadia, you Veronica, and Donna hold keys to my unlocking this treacherous mystery."

I realized my subconscious mind had supplied those words. In sudden clarity as I spoke them I understood their truth. In the shared silence that followed I stared into those hypnotic blue eyes. 

Sudden gonging as Hjordis pounded an iron plowshare announcing supper caused us to start in surprise. Veronica smiled as she offered, "Very persuasive, Hunter. Do you always thus convince your prey that they must willingly step into your enticing traps so that that you may capture them?"

Before I could respond, she laughed softly, saying, "Never mind, let us eat, drink and talk. I will feely tell you about my trip with Hjordis. I expect the same candor from you concerning this 'something' of yours."

She glanced over to the cook fires as she said softly, "I find myself persuaded to let your comely seafarer live. I am open to being fully converted."

With that, Princess Veronica turned, leading her horse to the stables and leaving me musing at the corral fence.
