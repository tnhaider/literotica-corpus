 Belba looked in the mirror, admiring how her skimpy dress clung to her two-and-a-half foot body. With a flourish, she added the finishing touch, a hair pin with a small metal book crossed by a pen and a sword, the symbol of the human goddess Fel Alda. She looked totally fuckable. Hopefully, the humans would find her so as well. Lots of horny human men would be making the short journey from the newly colonized Draenae Prarie up to Halflingdale tonight. That made tonight a good night for Halflette sluts like Belba. 

Halflingdale had been a hub for travelers for many centuries, but the recent expansions of the human empire had flooded the city-state with visitors. Although the humans had never formally annexed Halflingdale, the city state had been under human authority for over a year, since the king had died. The new queen spent most of her time locked in her chambers with her human lover, leaving her minister (also a human) to govern Halflingdale in her stead. Halfling men grumbled about this state of affairs, but didn't dare challenge the humans. Most halflettes, on the other hand, didn't mind the human presence at all. Humans were notorious exploiters of resources, but the only valuable resource in Halflingdale was Halfling pussy. And halflettes were only too happy to give it up. After all, the average human penis was half the length of a halflette's torso.

Belba eagerly stepped out into the night. The sun had just gone down but already the streets of Halflingdale were beginning to teem with activity. The female Halfling population was beginning its nightly exodus to the taverns. She made her way to the Wasted Wench, one of the larger hubs of human activity. It was still early, so she hoped to find a human all to herself, and hopefully keep him for the night (or at least until she passed out). If not, then she would gladly be someone's second helping. 

She was not disappointed. There was a human man sitting alone at the bar. He was fairly good looking. Tall, even for a human, with dark hair and a muscular body. 

Of course, the description "tall, with a muscular body" applied to pretty much every male human in existence compared to Halflings. The human men who found their way to Halflingdale were often some of the least attractive in the human empire- men who stood little chance with human women. Human women might find them unfuckable, but to halflettes, they were sex gods. Even the least attractive human was more palatable to a halflette than the most attractive halfling man. As a matter of fact, using the adjective attractive to describe a male Halfling, even in her own mind, made Belba giggle. It was so ridiculous. 

She strutted up to the man, hoping to catch his eyes with her swaying hips. As usual, however, she was beneath the eyes of the mighty human... literally. He didn't notice her until she put her hand on his knee. 

He turned his face downward to her, smiling and eyeing her up and down. "What can I do for yeh, little miss Halflette?" 

Belba felt a trickle of her juices run down her thigh. The way he looked down at her made her feel so small, the deep timbre of his voice sent shivers down her spine, the bulge in his pants promised a package five times as big as a halfling's at least. She also had to resist the urge to run and hide; the impulse all Halflings felt when under the scrutiny of other races. 

No time to be overawed. Seductive. Be seductive. 

"Well sir," she said, returning the human's smile, "I have a bit of a problem."

"Oh?" He sipped his ale. "What kind of problem?"

She slowly slid her hand up his leg. "Well you see," she said breathily, "It's my pussy. It's just too tight! Could you, maybe..." She caressed his gargantuan cock through his pants. "Stretch it out for me? With your big, hard, thick human dick?" 

He took another sip of his ale, then paused for a moment before replying. "Do you know what the best thing is about you halflettes?" He asked.

"That we're the perfect height to suck human cock without even kneeling down?" A clich√©. Belba had heard it hundreds of times. 

He laughed. "That's pretty great too. But no. The best thing about halflettes is you're all so easy. If I take out my dick anywhere in this city, two or more halflettes will appear like magic and fight over who gets to suck it first. It's like your goddess designed you all to be the cumdumps of the entire world."

Belba blushed. It was embarrassing, but true. 

"I fucking love halflettes!" he continued. "And that's why... I'm not going to fuck you." 

"I.. What?!" That didn't make any sense. 

"Did you know that ninety-five percent of all children born of Halfling females in the past year have been human?"

Belba put her hands on her hips. "Well yeah, I didn't actually know that, but I kind of figured. I mean, no halflette that's been with a human will ever go back to fucking a Halfling, and since babies in the world of Manifest are always full-blooded members of their father's race, it makes sense that a lot of halflettes are having human babies. I've thought about doing it myself, to be honest."

The human raised a finger. "But that means practically no new Halflings are being born. At this rate, your entire race will go extinct in less than a century." 

"Who the hell cares?" asked Belba, beginning to feel irritated. As far as she was concerned, the Halfling race had been doomed the first time a Halflette had laid eyes on non-halfling dick. 

"I care!" he declared. "I want my great grandchildren to enjoy easy halflette pussy, and their children, and their children." He raised his hand with mock solemnity. "I have taken... the Halflette Mother Fuckers Pledge." 

Now she was seriously pissed. "The what? What the fuck is that?"

"Someone in the RNHR Committee thought it up." He pointed at his crotch. "For the preservation of the Halfling race I pledge that this cock will not go into a halflette unless at least one child of her own race has come out of her."

"I have a Halfling kid," she lied. 

"Oh really?" He laughed. "In that case, take 'im down to the Prancing Puss- the RNHRC has an office there. They'll give you a special ribbon to show that you're a MILF- then any man as has taken the pledge will gladly stretch out you're little coochie for ya, miss. Till then, you're gonna have some problems feeding your sausage-hunger. Just about all the men out on the Draenae ranches have already taken the pledge, and probably the ones from the cities too. And if, as I suspect, you don't really have any kids, then I'd suggest finding a halfling bloke and getting busy."

Belba pouted. "But I don't want any halfling kids. I'd much rather bear children for a big, strong, manly human like you." 

He looked at her sternly. "I ain't opposed to the idea putting a bun up in yer little toaster oven. Hell, wouldn't be the first time I knocked up a Halfling. But you gotta have at least one Halfling baby first, otherwise no dick for you. Now shoo. That fine MILF behind you looks like she wants my attention."

The halflette in question rudely pushed Belba aside. She was at least ten years older than Belba was. 

"Man, you'll fuck this old bag, and not me?" She groaned petulantly. 

The human man picked up the older halflette, setting her in his lap. Her nimble fingers went to work on his belt buckle. "She has the ribbon," he said simply, pointing to her hair. Sure enough, in the older halflette's hair was a purple ribbon with the letters MILF spell proudly in gold. 

"Fuck off," said the MILF. 

Belba angrily strode away. She paused at the door of the tavern, looking back. The older halflette blew her a kiss across the room and grinned wickedly. Her grin turned to a look of utter ecstasy as the human lowered her onto his cock. 

---

Belba sighed, draining the last of her ale from her mug. It was nearly midnight and she had found absolutely zero willing human males to fuck her silly. What a disaster. At this point she was getting desperate. Maybe there was an elf in town who was in rut? Maybe she could slip into the stall of an orc slave... she wouldn't normally contemplate fucking an orc but right now she was drunk enough and horny enough to consider it. 

Just when she had made up her mind to try it, a human woman slid into the chair across from her. "Hello," she said. "I couldn't help but notice you're having some trouble finding companionship tonight, miss...?"

"Belba," said Belba, slightly taken aback. Human women didn't often come to Halflingdale. She was gorgeous, with pale, unblemished skin and silky jet black hair. Belba hesitated before continuing. "I um, don't normally swing that way, but I'll make an exception tonight, if you like. Especially if you'd introduce me to some of your guy friends later." 

The human woman smiled. Damn, she was pretty. Yes, Belba would gladly make an exception for this one. "I appreciate the offer, Miss Belba, but I'm here on business today, not pleasure. I'm with the Intelligence Guild. My name is Fellen, by the way."

"So you're like, some kind of spy?" 

"Exactly," said Fellen. "And I have a proposal for you, Miss Belba. If you agree, I can ensure you that your lust will be sated."

Belba perked up. "I'm listening."

"I'll need you to do some things for me," said Fellen, "But I can't tell you what things until you agree."

Well, that was vague. "Some things" could mean anything from licking Fellen's pussy to carrying out an assassination. Still, Belba was over a barrel. Without a MILF ribbon, she was never going to get any human cock again, and LIKE HELL was she going to breed with a puny, scrawny, effeminate, tiny dicked, limp dicked premature ejaculator of a male Halfling. 

"I'm in," said Belba. 

"Good. Then here is your first assignment." Fellen leaned in, pointing with her thumb toward the back of the inn. "In about ten minutes, a group of halflings and halflettes are going to meet in that room back there. You are to attend the meeting and report back to me on what is said. The password to get into the meeting is 'Bil Basa's Shadow'. Got it?"

Belba saluted. "Yes ma'am."

--

Aldaldrida stormed through the doors of the minister's chamber in a rage. "Minister Toran, this new edict is absolutely INTOLERABLE! I demand that you repeal it at once!"

Avathel Toran, Minister and de facto ruler of Halflingdale leaned over his desk, leering at Aldaldrida. Toran was an older human man, perhaps 45, with graying hair and an oily smile. "Princess Aldaldrida. How unexpected," he said in a bored tone. He had the power here and he knew it. Bastard. "I would stand to greet you, but... well..." A distinct slurping sound and a giggle came from beneath his desk. He smiled. "What part of my latest edict do you take issue with, princess? Not that it matters."

Aldaldrida's face heated. This man, this human who her sister had entrusted the fate of all Halflingdale had no respect for his office or for the people he ruled. She sputtered with anger. "Allowing human merchants to do business in Halflingale is one thing, but exempting them from royal taxation is quite another! You'll drive Halfling merchants out of business with this policy. This edict is a clear violation of our national sovereignty and as a Princess of Halflingdale I cannot allow it!" 

Toran leaned back in his chair, looking bored. "As always, Princess, if you have a problem with my policy

You should take it up with your sister the Queen, on whose authority I operate." That was his standard response. But then he grinned wickedly, continuing. "Of course that's only if she's willing to take her mouth off human cock long enough to talk with you, which I, personally, doubt." 

"How dare you speak of my sister so! She is the Queen of all Halflingdale. She could remove you from your position with a word!"

Toran sighed patiently. "Perhaps the time has come for me to be frank with you, Princess. Your sister is a slave to her lusts, lusts that only humans can satisfy. Your city is ours. The Halfling race has been conquered by the human empire. Everyone knows this. You know this. So I have to wonder why you keep storming into my office every time I issue legislation. Perhaps you have some other motivation?" He openly leered at Aldaldrida's breasts. "It's a real shame no one is palming those big tits of yours. A real shame." 

Aldaldrida pointedly ignored the surge of wetness in her nether regions. These arrogant humans infuriated her. She hastily excused herself from the room. Aldaldrida found it best to limit her time in the presence of human men, especially if they expressed interest in carnality. It wouldn't do to fall into decadence as her sister had. 

Though it was infuriating, she accepted that the goddesses had created the different races with different abilities, and in the categories of physical prowess and sexuality, Halflings were the least gifted of all the races. This was simply the undeniable truth. Bil Basa, patron goddess of the Halflings, was the Lady of Night, the deity of shadow, concealment, secrecy. Halflings had a talent for going unnoticed by the other races and the Halfling strategy for world dominance involved waiting quietly in the shadows until the other races had killed each other off. 

Sadly, this strategy was no longer feasible in current conditions. Minister Toran was no longer even hiding how he served human interests. Curse him! Curse all humans! They thought that just because they were twice as tall as the tallest halflings and four times stronger, that they could do whatever they wanted! That they could have whichever halflette they wanted however they wanted, just because their penises were longer and thicker than a halflette's forearm... on average. She had heard that many were even bigger.

Aldaldrida shook her head in an attempt to rid her mind of that image, but it didn't quite work. She felt a familiar heat and slickness in her traitorous nether regions. Curse the humans, even her own body rebelled against her. Thankfully there was still some time before tonight's meeting with Bil Basa's Shadow. She made her way to her bedchamber, slipping her new dildo from her dresser drawer and laying back on the bed. 

She gave the four-inch clay penis a lick to slick it up, slipping her other hand under her skirt to play with her pussy. In her mind, she conjured up an image of Telbo Flaggart, the famous halfling bachelor. Three years ago Telbo been considered the most attractive Halfling in the city state. These days he was a drunken wreck, but that didn't stop Aldaldrida from fantasizing about how he had once been. She slipped the dildo into her pussy, starting slowly but quickly picking up the pace, thrusting with ferocious hedonistic abandon up her snatch.

But, try as she might, "satisfaction" did not come. Her arm was becoming tired. What was wrong with her? She had gotten this didlo only last week. At four inches it was bigger than the biggest recorded halfling's erect penis. How could it not satisfy her? 

She lay back on her bed, frustrated. Fucking humans. This was all their fault. She remembered minister Toran and his arrogant sneer, his tall stature, the way he looked down at her, like she was less than him, like she was nothing. And her quim quivered and moistened. His human gaze was indeed powerful. Ashamed, but too horny to care, Aldaldrida shoved the dildo back in her sopping twat. She remembered the slurping and giggling noises coming from beneath the minister's desk. A halflette had been down there, sucking his cock. 

What would it be like, she wondered, to suck a human cock? She pulled the dildo out of herself, bringing it up to her mouth. Was Minister Toran's cock as big as this? Probably. Most humans were even bigger, or so she had heard. She imagined herself standing before a human, massive dick dangling erect mere inches from her face. She was, as the clich√© went, short enough to suck him without kneeling down. She imagined herself licking the tip, doing the same to her dildo as her other hand continued to furiously play with her clit. 

Then the human in her imagination (who was as arrogant and self-centered as all humans are) grabbed her head and thrust his cock down her throat. Aldaldrida gagged as she frantically shoved her dildo deep into her throat in imitation of her imagination. Her back arched and she reached climax within seconds, gushing all over her legs and her sheets. 

Coming down from her orgasmic high, she shuffled off the bed and into the bath. She might be a little late for her meeting, but she needed to wash off the stink of sex and shame before meeting with her friends-the one group of Halflings who still resisted the humans. 

--

The dimly lit room quieted as Aldaldrida passed through the doors. Even with a dark hooded cloak to hide her face she was instantly recognizable thanks to the freakishly large size of her breasts. Her elder sister had often teasingly called her "titty princess" during their adolescence, and the nickname had stuck, though few dared use it in her presence. 

She lowered her hood. "Bil Basa's Shadow," she proclaimed. 

"May She shelter us all," murmured the assembled halflings and halflettes. The familiar faces of the secret Halfling society reassured Aldaldrida. The smith, Bondo, smoked his pipe in the corner, his face carrying his usual sour expression. Valbet, the seamstress, smiled at Aldaldrida encouragingly. She was one of the few unmarried halflettes in the Shadow. Rubar, the owner of the inn, and Teli, his wife looked pretty grim, though they seemed to cheer up when they saw her. There were many others. And, surprisingly, there was an unfamiliar halflette at the end of one of the room's tables. She must have been a new recruit. The Shadow got few enough of those these days, especially female ones. Aldaldrida resolved to talk with her personally after the meeting. For now, there were more important issues to attend to. 

She sat down at the small table at the head of the room. "We meet in the Shadow of our Goddess to advance the cause of the Halfling," she announced, formally starting the meeting. 

Eubart, the pudgy baker, quickly stood and spoke. "Princess," he said, "Have you heard the latest human outrage?"

"Yes," she replied. "The Minister's taxation policies are indeed intolerable. But before we get to that-"

"Taxation policies?" Eubart broke in. "I was speaking of the so-called 'Mother Fuckers Pledge' that the human men have taken."

"Mother... I had not heard of this. What exactly does this pledge entail?"

"The humans swear not to have carnality with any halflette save those who are the mothers of Halfling children. Mothers of Halfling children, or MILFs, as the humans call them, are issued a special ribbon denoting their status."

Aldaldrida frowned. "Well, that is awfully patronizing of them. Still, isn't this good news?"

"Tell that to my twelve year old son!" Eubart wailed. "My wife took him in to the humans in order to get one of those ribbons. Now she wears it day and night, showing off her eligibility to the humans. How is my son supposed to grow up with pride as a halfling?" 

"Indeed," said Bompher the tanner. "My wife has never wanted children, but now she suddenly does. She denies it, but I know the true reason she suddenly wants a kid is so that she can ignore him, and me, and go back to choking on human cock."

Aldaldrida pounded her fist on the table. "Language, Bompher!" She admonished. "We are Halflings, not humans. Never refer to carnality with such direct terms, as they do."

Bompher sat down, embarrassed. 

Aldaldrida sighed, shaking her head. Then she began to speak. "My fellow halflings and halflettes, these are trying times for us all. Once this city was the pride and joy of the Halfling race, proof of our ingenuity and industriousness. Now it is a wretched hive of human scum and carnal baseness.
