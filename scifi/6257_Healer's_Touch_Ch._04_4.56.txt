 Charles gazed into the fire as he stroked the soft skin of the foal that was resting at his side. Occasionally he glanced down at the small creature. Across the fire, Kat was curled up with a blanket and in a deep slumber. The shadows under her eyes told their own story. She had fought quite the battle as she helped the zephti make it's entrance into the world. The foal made a questioning sound as it looked at Kat.

"Relax, she is just sleeping," he reassured the colt. Since his people settled in the desert, the zephti had been a mystery. The scientists were still trying to figure out why zephti young bonded with Aresericans. It had simply been the way of it. He had assumed that the foal would bond with him but to his surprise the colt had chosen to bond with Kat. It was the first time that he had ever seen it happen. Even when Earthlings were present the zephti always chose the Areserican. Maybe the colt recognized her as the one that had helped him into the world. 

He watched in amusement as the colt left his side and stumbled on it's shaky legs to Kat's side. It's mother lifted her head and watched as the baby plopped down next to Kat. Charles couldn't help but chuckle when it lipped at a strand of her hair. Kat mumbled in her sleep and turned towards the colt.

He wished that she was different...that she was as lacking power as he was. Today he had seen that she had a backbone of steel that was tempered with compassion. If he were looking for a queen to rule at his side, she would be a very good candidate. If she were powerless, he wouldn't resist the desire to make her his queen and mate.
