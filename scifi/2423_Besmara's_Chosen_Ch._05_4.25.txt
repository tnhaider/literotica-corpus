 The air was harsh, Erkos could tell that a storm was coming. This was the sort of thing that should be avoided. It was something a ship could weather, but why risk it. It might be better to make it to the shallows and wait out the roiling waves. 

However the captain did not share is concerns. That didn't matter though, Erkos opinion of the man couldn't go any lower after all. Or so he had thought until this idiot decision. Arrogant, cruel, stupid. Erkos muttered in undercommon using every foul word that he'd learned from his father and many that he'd learned from his aunt and been forbidden from using by his father. 

"Can't believe I ever found him hot." He groused, tugging on a rope to secure it in the wake of the oncoming storm. "Can't believe I wanted to suck his dick. He wouldn't deserve having his dick sucked by a... a..." He paused and thought. "A ravenous ghoul!" He snapped, tying the rope off. 

"And Plugg and Scourge, stupid names." He held his wings up, trying to protect himself from the battering storm, however even with that small protection he felt his strength waning. His lungs were weakening, trembling.

The the new rope he had been passed slipped out of his hands and he fell to the ground coughing, his chest heaving with pain, fumbling for his potion. He silently thanked Sandara's kindness in retrieving it for him. Far as it concerned him, he owed her his life. Quickly he gulped it down, feeling its magic sooth his lungs and calm their reactions to his exertions. Amusement crossed his mind for a split second, realising that he never needed this potion for anything sexual, likely yet another quirk of his outsider biology.

Slipping it back away he felt a whip come down on his back, tearing away flesh. He bit back tears and rage, composing himself and not even letting a scream break his lips. He pulled his wings to himself, making him look pathetic and utterly broken down physically. It seemed to work and Plugg screamed at him to get back down to the infirmary. Erkos collapsed, trying to catch his breath and healing up his back. 

Looking to the ceiling he sighed and shook his head. He wasn't cut out for this sort of work. He was agile, and skilled with words. He knew how to lead prayers to Besmara, and heal the wounded, he was even learning magic to help ease sickness. He wasn't built for hard labour. Letting the tears flow he curled up and began to softly sing to himself, a song in undercommon, a lullaby. The soft song continued, between muffled sobs until the oblivion of sleep took him. 

Then the next day came, and the storm was still raging. Erkos was rushed back up on deck, though his entire body was trembling with a weakness he wasn't accustomed to. The storm howled around him and he tried to keep himself working but his body was failing him and only a couple of hours into the morning he collapsed. A flash of pain in his back told him that his moment of weakness had been noticed by an officer, by the intense pain of the cat's lash he knew who it was. He looked up noticing a leering Scourge standing over him. 

"Get back to work." He snarled, holding the cat aloft, ready to bring it down on the young tiefling again, his eyes full of bloodlust and a level of pleasure at the idea of causing Erkos more pain. 

Erkos looked up. "Can't... but I can use magic to bolster the men." 

Surprisingly Scourge relented, and Erkos stood. He cast the magic on Scourge, who kept coming back to have it re-cast on him, though he was mostly only yelling at the men who were actually doing the work. Erkos snarled at him behind his back.

Again that night Erkos collapsed into his bed, with no one snuggly to spend the night with, as everyone was extremely busy trying not to die. 

The awful rocking was gone. Erkos looked up and felt his tail twitch. He felt completely drained, every part of his body aching with pure agony. He felt every muscle in his body scream at him in pure rage for the poor treatment during the storm. At the same time a driving need to fuck someone filled his mind as his balls ached for release. It had been two days, two days of a storm where the only thought was survival. 

Slowly he moved up on deck, shielding his eyes from the glaring light. The storm had calmed and no one had been lost to the waves. Erkos dropped to his knees a little and said a prayer of thanks to Besmara. As he offered up the quick prayer he heard noise behind him and deftly leapt to his feet, not wishing to taste the lash today. However it was only Croop who looked at him. 

"Going to make crabs tonight, get some people together and go out and catch some for me." Erkos nodded quickly, grateful that it had been Croop to approach him and not someone else. The constant whippings were starting to get more than a bit old. 

As he ran to gather the people he thought best suited for this task his eyes drifted to Tarn who was passing by. The Nagaji grinned and flicked his tongue over his lips, causing Erkos to feel a stiffening in his pants. He readjusted, and felt the slickness of precum leaking from his member. 

However right now he was required to go catch some dinner, so that meant he couldn't slink off to deal with his incessant desires. The thought of the night before the storm drifted to his mind and he moaned softly at the memory. 

Brought back to reality by his fellow captives showing up Erkos turned away and jumped into the ocean, the shock of the cold water helping calm his mind. Though it was stupid that they had to do this, at least it meant that he'd be able to focus a little more rather than have his mind hazy with lust. 

Swimming to the reef was difficult, and some seemed to be having more difficulty than normal. However everyone made it there. Finding and grabbing the crabs was easy, and Erkos grinned. 

"Maybe we should grab some shellfish too." He said, only to be interrupted by Murch screaming about giant monsters. 

Erkos turned around and saw two nasty looking crustaceans. Reefclaws apparently. Well, to him they were just oversized crabs. However there wasn't much he could do to them from where he was, instead staying back to heal anyone who needed it. The battle was over in a matter of moments, with the large half-orc killing one very quickly, the first reefclaw injuring the second one in its death frenzy, then the second quickly finished off by Murch. 

Erkos grinned and swam down to collect a bucket full of clams and other shellfish. That would just add that extra little needed bit to the food. Upon returning to the ship the half-orc was given every last shred of credit, since he was the one who dragged them onto the boat. Erkos shook his head and sighed and walked down to the kitchen with his own offering of shellfish and crabs. 

Croop happy accepted the extra sorts of meat, both from the reefclaws and from the many shellfish that Erkos had collected. 

That evening Erkos was about to go hunt down Tarn, the sexy Nagaji owed him some ass after that display earlier. Erkos groaned softly, gently grabbing himself thinking about it. And was promptly scared out of his hide by Plugg who came up behind him. 

His tail swishing skeptically he eyed Plugg. "What do you want?" he half-growled. 

"Come with me, we need to talk." Plugg said, for once not showing outright hostility. However Erkos could tell it wasn't a polite request, so he followed, muttering about how he had more important things to do. 

Plugg looked over his shoulder. "Whoever you're deciding to fuck tonight, they'll still be there you little whore." he commented offhand, causing Erkos to bristle and such accusations. He liked sex and would fuck near anyone who was handsome enough, heck he was so desperate right now he would even allow the Captain to take his ass. However he was not a whore, he'd never been given a coin for the sex he gave. He enjoyed it for the pleasure of it, and would never consider whoring himself. 

"Your last name really, fucking Marasgift, bit presumptuous for a two-bit whore." 

Erkos could tell he was being baited, and kept his mouth shut, though his tail whipped about and his fangs were bared. 

Plugg led him to his cabin. "Have some wine." he said, pouring Erkos a glass, who inspected it thoroughly. 

"It's not poisoned, idiot." Plugg snapped, glaring at Erkos, fury in his eyes. He obviously wanted nothing more than to break and hurt this tiefling, but was not sure how. 

"Listen.. Boy... there's been a divide in the crew. Some aren't following the Captain like they should. Now... you need to make sure that they do. If not, well we'll throw you in the ocean and then we'll see how well your precious Besmara saves you." He grinned, showing off rotting teeth, and making Erkos feel a bit sick to his stomach. 

Carefully weighing his words Erkos said. "I'll make sure that the people on this ship follow a worthy captain." The wordplay seemed to pay off and Plugg nodded and grinned. 

"Good to see we're on the same page. Now get out before the men on this ship think I'm some sort of faggot. I've heard the stories that you suck cock." He grinned in a nasty way that was extremely unsettling. 

Erkos held back his rage, feeling it bubbling up in his chest again and walked out of the cabin, standing proud and tall. He wasn't going to bow or bend knee to this tyrant. He was a proper follower of Besmara, and would not be cowed by anyone like Plugg. 

Now it was time to take care of the thoughts that had been weighing on his mind all day, as well as some very pent up aggression that was bubbling through his veins. Maybe fucking his lover's ass would help. Would be better than biting someone again. His movements were swift and he sought out Tarn, grabbing the nagaji by his pants and pulling him down towards his quarters, feeling Tarn's twin cocks hardening and sliding out of their sheath within his breeches. 

"You gave me such the hardon before, now it's time to pay for that." He growled, his eyes glowing with demonic lust. "Your ass is going to get fucked like nothing before." His tail quivered at the anticipation of taking his lover. 

Tarn didn't fight it, instead following Erkos to his quarters and swiftly undressing. The sight of Tarn's well muscled ass caused Erkos' cock to harden. He groaned in pleasure and pulled his pants off slowly as he stroked his stiffening cock while reaching for some oils to make his entrance easy. 

Tarn had crawled onto the bed, laying on his back, stroking his swiftly hardening 

cocks as Erkos joined him, moving in animalistic fashion. With a swift thrust Erkos pushed into his lover's ass, grunting with the pleasure of it. Then he began to push deeper, pulling out slightly and trusting deeper moving between rhythmic thrusts and wild fucking. 

An ear flicked backwards and he looked over his shoulder to see the door open. Sandara had followed them and sat there, eyes wide, hand drifting towards her groin as she watched Erkos continue to shove his massive cock into Tarn's glorious ass. He turned his full attention back to Tarn, who seemed to have his own attention elsewhere, his eyes drifting between Erkos and the now naked woman who pleasured herself as she watched her own personal theater of two hot guys fucking like animals. 

Erkos grunted, continuing to take his lover's ass, holding tight to the muscular nagaji's form with each thrust feeling a tension in his balls. It was sooner than normal, but this made sense. He'd not had release in over two days. "Uhnnggg Tarn... oh yeah that's it... mmmm your ass is so nice and tight. Don't take many cocks do you?" He thrust again, grunting and murring as the pressure built. 

"Yeah... you ready? You ready for my cum?" He hissed, thrusting wildly. Another thrust and Erkos felt himself explode in Tarn's ass, grunting with pleasure as he did. 

Slowly he withdrew, panting, only to find himself grabbed and flipped over onto all fours, Tarn swiftly plunging into his ass with one of his massive cocks. "My turn, now it's time for you to really scream my name." Tarn grinned and grabbed Erkos' ass holding onto it with one hand as he thrust deep into the tiefling's tight butt, gasping with pleasure with each thrust. 

Erkos let out a long moan grasping at the bed sheets as Tarn thrust deep into him, smacking his hot little ass. The ecstasy of feeling Tarn's cool scaled body pressed against his smooth skin made every part of him tremble. Then another deep thrust elicited a scream of pleasure from Erkos, as he dug his nails into the bedsheets deeper. 

"Uhggg... Yeah mmm... oh Tarn. Fuck me harder. Take my ass... do it, pound it." Precum was constantly dripping from the head or Erkos' massive erect cock. "Yeah, fuck me." His wings stretched out and he whimpered and gasped with pure pleasure. Tarn gasped in pleasure and grunted deeply, ramming his reptilian cock deep in Erkos as one last time and came, his seed spilling both into his partner's ass and onto the bed under him. Feeling the cum spill deep inside of him Erkos let out a deep shuddering moan as he felt his own cock erupt with cum, spraying everywhere. 

Though lust still filled his body, Erkos felt no strength left and let the darkness of sleep take him tangled up in Tarn's strong arms. 

The awful rocking was gone. Erkos looked up and felt his tail twitch. He felt completely drained, every part of his body aching with pure agony. He felt every muscle in his body scream at him in pure rage for the poor treatment during the storm. At the same time a driving need to fuck someone filled his mind as his balls ached for release.
