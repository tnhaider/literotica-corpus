 Things in this story are not canon. They are not meant to be. I do hope you enjoy it. 

(There is a "Terms explained" at the end of the chapter for unfamiliar words, language translation, and specific term usage.)

This is the beginning of Æiristus' (drow) and Silwynn's (sylvan elf) story - it has more of an erotic lean to it now than originally intended, but it works. • 

It is "understood" that because of their cruelty and unfamiliarity to emotions like love drow do not bond. Surface-world elves, on the other hand, choose to bond when they find the mate they wish to join with for the rest of their lives. Through an accident of fate, these two get spiritually bonded and, like it or not, they must learn to deal with it. There are many obstacles that interfere with not only the journey of learning to manage the situation, but in any final admission and acceptance of it as well. How far will bonded blood enemies get without killing each other? If you're interested read on…

Feedback is always welcome. This is the beginning of a novel and I can use the input. Thanks! -GildedLily
