 If you read Fallen Angel, then you'll remember characters like Zakreel and Remuel (names sound familiar? Yep. They're Remien's and Zachariel's daddies). And the reapers, Abdiel, on whose back Davariel entered the demon planet's realm. There's also Drakken, Rowie's father, who Devon had been told in Dark Prince, was in a prison on Mercury in our solar system. But he wasn't. Well, get ready, because they're coming back.

Hope you like this chapter. This new planet of Arboria is home to many fantastical creatures, like faeries, elves, unicorns, mermaids, talking animals, etc... You'll see witches (like Alluna), wizards, dragons and even a few fairytale characters like the old lady in a shoe, little red riding hood... well, read on and you'll see as the rest of this story unfolds. This is an alternate universe where everything is possible and all legends exist.
