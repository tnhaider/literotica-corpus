 Little Jake was terrified. He didn't know what was going on, other than that his mother was crying and his father looked distressed.

He shrunk further into the corner, and watched with fascination as his mother's tears floated in the air.

She said something to his father, gathered herself and wiped the tears, and turned to him.

"Son, I need you to be brave, okay? Come with me." she said as she tried to steel herself.

She led him to a cargo area, pointed to an empty ore container and told him to climb in. He did.

"Stay there, and no matter what, don't come out until I come back here to get you."

And so he did, crouched inside, he could hear the unintelligible voices and the shouts of the crew as they prepared for what was coming.

Minutes passed, crawling for what seemed like an eternity. Then he heard a bang and the sound of suction. His breath quickened and he could feel the pressure change. Emergency measures sealed the cargo bay.

He was alone.

Against his mother's wishes, he climbed out of the container and floated his way through the cargo bay, he put his ear against the wall like he often did, and listened intently.

He could hear the loud bangs and the screams of pain. Someone shouted something loudly and he heard a loud crack and an explosion.

He heard a lot of sizzling sounds, a scream or two and then things quieted down.

He heard his mother screaming his father's name, weeping.
