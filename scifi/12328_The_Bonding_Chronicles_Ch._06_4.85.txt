 ***** Blustery Friendships *****

Allison's black GEO Metro drove at a slow and careful pace through the windswept beauty of highway 101. The tall pine trees swayed in chaotic directions as the storm raged around them. Andrew's happy laugh filled the back seat while Allison exhaled and rolled her eyes in exasperation.

"Seriously, Sara?"

The joy on Sara's face as she teased her friend was contagious. "All I'm saying is that we might be eighty when we get there. That's all."

The traffic was moving at a measured pace as the motorists made their way with cautious anxiety through the storm. While their forty five miles per hour pace seemed reasonable to Andrew and Allison, Sara wished they were going faster. She took her frustration and channeled it into a continuous running commentary on how to negotiate traffic.

"Andrew, come on, back me up here." Allison pleaded from the driver's seat.

"Mommy, please leave Alli alone. She is super preoccupied. It takes a lot of concentration to drive this slow." Andrew responded with a teasing chuckle.

"Uggggh, you two are soo annoying."

Sara looked into the back seat and gave Andrew a playful wink. He smiled at her while he brushed his hair back. Placing his completed Calculus homework back into his rucksack he stretched out his side and winced as he prodded his tender bruises. The pain from his earlier fight had faded, but the dull ache served as a constant reminder of what had happened.

Andrew was pleased by how immaculate and pristine Allison's car was. It was at least a few years old but everything looked as if it had never been used. He admired how well maintained it was, and felt like he could almost sense the machine as it purred around them. It was clear that Allison loved her car, and she took great care of it.

"Alli, seriously though, thanks for this. Don't let little miss speedster up there get to you. This is some pretty intense weather, and you're doing awesome."

The gaunt woman looked at Andrew through the rearview mirror before rolling her eyes and letting out a dramatic exhale. "Yeah, whatever. This is all just stupid." She took a deep breath before continuing, "I mean seriously. Why did everyone have to decide to drive during the first storm in months?"

Allison grumbled to herself as she checked the mirrors. Her voice was mocking as she said, "Hey kids, what do you want to do today? Let's go to a boring town, in a stupid forest while a storm throws cars all over the interstate." Her melancholy rant ended as suddenly as it began. Andrew wondered why Allison felt compelled to pull herself into these kinds of moods.

"Seriously though, if you just get behind that guy over there. We will get there like twice as fast. I'm just saying." Sara provided her helpful tip while she looked back at Andrew with a guilty smile. She knew she should allow Allison to be frustrated and morose, but she couldn't help herself. Allison let out a loud exaggerated sigh as she changed lanes.

"OK, there. Are you happy now?"

Sara looked back to the other lane and seemed to be lost in thought before responding, "No, actually I changed my mind. This lane is no good. We better go back."

Andrew laughed. Allison went off on another rant about how stupid everyone was. How Sara was their queen, the grand ambassador for all the stupid people who felt a need to drive in a summer storm. Pulling out his history assignment Andrew started flipping through his school book while Allison maintained a steady rant. With a little effort he managed to distract Sara, and together they worked their way through their assignment while the storm rumbled around them.

The drive settled into a much more casual experience as Sara focused on her school work with Andrew. The young couple joked and bantered as they completed their assignments. This allowed Allison to drive at her casual and controlled pace, free from Sara's demands. The visit to Hoquiam was a logistical nightmare. Andrew managed to work out a pretty seamless plan.

They all went into the cellular store, long enough for Sara to authorize Andrew on her account. While Allison took Sara to the doctor, Andrew remained at the cellular store. He got Sara's new phone set up on her account, and then signed up and got himself the same phone. Andrew knew he needed to get a cell, and often wished he could look things up as ideas occurred to him. 

Now with his relationship to Sara, he realized that having a cell phone was vital. His parents would need a way to reach him, and he suspected he would not be home most of the time. Having a phone just ticked too many boxes for him not to handle it now. As he was finishing up the activation process, Sara and Allison arrived.

Once their business at the cellular store was complete, Allison dropped Andrew off at the electronics store before the girls went shopping. Forty five minutes later they met Andrew outside the store. They found him fiddling with his new phone, a happy grin on his face. Andrew put his large bag of electronics into the trunk and took out Allison's school bag. He brought it with him as he took his place in the back seat.

"Allison, I texted my folks and they want to know if you would like to join us for dinner?"

The young goth girl gripped her steering wheel and twisted her hands over its surface as she considered his offer. Looking over her shoulder she shrugged and said, "Sure, little squirrel. Now, why do you have my bag?"

Sara laughed as she raised her eyebrow, silently asking, "Yeah, why do you have her bag?"

"Well, Sara and I are done with our homework. I kinda figured maybe we could give you a hand with yours. That is, if you want."

Starting the car Allison shrugged. "Sure, why not."

Andrew opened the large black bag, finding that all of Allison's books and school supplies seemed to have the same dark theme as everything else in her life. He chuckled to himself as he pulled out her Health and Wellness textbook and notebook.

"What's so funny back there?" Allison's voice was sharp and defensive as she looked through the rearview mirror.

"Nothing, I just didn't know that Hot Topic sold school supplies." Andrew replied with a gentle laugh. Allison rolled her eyes as the corner of her mouth lifted into a brief smile. Sara laughed and gripped her friend's shoulder, giving her a gentle shake.

The drive back to Quinault was much faster as most of the motorists appeared to be keeping off the roads. They were all happy that the storm never opened up, and that the drive remained dry, if blustery. The air had an unexpected dry crispness to it that reminded Andrew of the electrical storms he used to experience in Arizona. As if the sky itself was excited and eager for something soon to arrive.

Sara and Allison seemed to relax as they entered the rainforest, getting ever closer to Lake Quinault. The temperature dropped and a rich humidity permeated the air. Andrew took a deep breath, finding the earthy fragrance somehow comforting. He understood why they would find this scent of home so relaxing. 

There was a sheltering warmth that came from the dense forest that surrounded them. The car moved with confidence down the road, unmolested by the strong storm winds that caused the trees to sway above them. Andrew finished packing Allison's bag. He was surprised that she seemed happy as they were pulling up to his house. Sara looked back at him excited, she was eager to see his parents again.

Andrew smiled at Sara and said, "We're home!" as the car came to a stop. 

Allison rolled her eyes as she looked between the two teen's happy expressions. "Nice little house you got here." Her voice was quiet and dispassionate as she looked at the dark shuttered building. The oppressive summer storm cast everything in artificial dusk. The warm light that flooded through the front door seemed all the more inviting for the contrast.

"Best hovel ever!" Andrew said with a hint of affection. He realized that he was starting to like this place. Exiting the car with his bag he nestled up against Sara. They shielded each other against the strong storm that buffeted everything within the clearing around his house. The cool late summer winds seemed to cut through his body, intensifying the aches within his small bruised frame.

The three teenagers gathered the last of their supplies before rushing into the house, escaping the building storm.

***** Dinner Time Confessions *****

The William's household was alive with the rich sound of feminine laughter. Michelle was cooking in the kitchen while Sara and Allison sat at the dining room table. The savory scent of stew filled the comfortable house while the women bantered.

Andrew worked with his father to finish the last few electrical projects. By the time dinner was ready Andrew had completed hooking up the last couple faceplates. His father had installed the electrical features in the secondary bedroom. They double checked each other's work before taking their places around the crowded table. Everyone was elbow to elbow as they took deep breaths of the aromatic stew that sat before them.

The hot meal smelled amazing as Andrew dipped his potato roll in the warm broth. Taking his first bite, Andrew exhaled with a happy grin as he savored the rich flavor and comforting warmth that spread out from his stomach. Listening to the howling winds outside he looked around the table, a fond smile across his face. Andrew watched everyone, happy that they seemed just as excited as he was by this surprisingly appropriate meal. 

"Wow, Michelle. This is amazing." Sara said as she chewed on a large piece of tender beef.

Allison blew on a small spoonful of thick broth and potato. "Yeah, this is really great." Andrew noticed that this was the most genuinely happy he had seen Allison since he had known her.

"So, Allison. How long have you lived in the Quinault area?" Michelle asked as she dabbed a piece of buttered roll into her broth.

"Well, my dad dragged me here a few years ago." The frustration in her voice was palpable. She sipped from her spoon, testing the temperature before taking all of its contents into her mouth.

"Where did you move from?" Michelle's voice was kind and gentle as she sensed some raw emotions around the subject. Sara looked between the two women as she ate from her bowl at a ravenous pace.

"Chicago." Allison's response was short. Her eyes never left her bowl as she poked and shifted its contents with a contemplative stare.

"I'm sorry, Dear. I shouldn't have pried." Michelle seemed concerned as she watched the skinny young woman.

"No, no... It's OK, really." Allison's tone was morose despite the forced smile she wore as she looked at Andrew's mother. Her eyes failed to hide a secret pain that everyone saw, but no one asked about.

"Well, do you at least like it here?" Michelle had not known Allison long, but she knew that her response was not going to be positive.

"What's not to like? School is stupid. The students are idiots. The teachers are dumb, and the weather is an ever changing tapestry of gloom and shadow. This entire place runs on a cycle of death." She pushed a piece of meat around her bowl while she thought to herself. "The one ray of light is that your son seems hell bent on being murdered by the dumbest person in school. So at least there's that." She looked at Andrew with a mocking smile.

Everyone at the table sighed in frustration as they shook their heads at Andrew.

"Seriously, are we back on this?" Andrew said in defensive frustration as he looked around the table. Taking another bite of his soaked roll, he continued to look at the disapproving faces while he chewed.

"Son, what do you expect? We just want you to be safe." Dave's voice rang with obvious concern from across the table. The women nodded their heads, except Allison who took a bite of stew with feigned indifference.

"Well then you have to let me deal with it." Andrew said with exaggerated frustration as he directed his dirty spoon around the table. "Ohhh, that reminds me." Andrew said before taking a bite of stew. He enjoyed the annoyance on everyone's faces while they were forced to wait for him to finish chewing.

After swallowing, Andrew said, "I ran into Will in the hallway before sixth today." The eager eyes watched him with anticipation while he picked up his glass and drank.

"Really, sweetie? You little demon." Sara's voice was fond but annoyed as she watched Andrew's prolonged drink of water with a playful glower.

He gasped in appreciation as the glass left his lips. "Mmmm, that was refreshing." Andrew appraised the glass in his grasp before glancing around the table in surprise. "Ohh, that's right. I was saying something."

They all grumbled in frustration as they waited at the edge of their seats.

"Anyways, I passed Will in the hall before sixth and he just casually greeted me. He wasn't friendly but he showed no sign of hostility either."

Relief started to settle on everyone at the table as Michelle asked, "Do you think he might be playing it cool until everything blows over?"

Andrew considered this thought for a moment before responding, "No, his friends were with him and I could see he was struggling a bit with whether to let it go or double down. I really do think this is over now."

Michelle and Dave knew Andrew well enough to trust his assessment. He has always been able to read people with a surprising level accuracy. The few times they disregarded his concerns for a contractor it had always come back to bite them. They were excited to see how their son had used his intelligence and awareness to evaluate this problem. While they were pleased that he found a way to escape his situation, they wished he had chosen a less dangerous path.

"Well that's fantastic, Andrew!" Michelle said while Sara rubbed his back. Her affectionate touch brought tingles to Andrew's body while he watched the relieved faces looking back at him. Allison smiled at him while she took another small bite of stew and considered what Andrew had just said.

"So, what the hell was the point of antagonizing Will? I mean seriously, was it worth this..." Allison said as she gave him a sharp poke on his bruised side.

Andrew yelped in surprise as he shifted away from her. Sara rested her hand on his back while she asked, "What is Alli talking about, Andrew?" She thought back on the events of Andrew's assault. While she could see Will standing over him, she could not hear what was being said.

Everyone looked between Allison and Andrew, expecting an explanation. Andrew looked at Allison ànd glowered before stating, "Well, let's hear what people are saying first."

Allison explained, "From what I heard, after Will hit you, you called him a bitch. Of course, Samantha was telling everyone that you said you fucked his mother."

The entire table gasped in shock.

"How could you, Andrew. No wonder he was so upset." Michelle stated while she stared daggers at her son.

"Of course I didn't say that. Does that really sound like me?"

"Well, no. I guess not. But what did happen?"

Andrew took a deep breath before walking everyone through the events of the attack. He of course left Sara's involvement out of his story, but they both looked at each other in the knowledge of what happened. He could see the sharp pain on Sara's face as she relived the assault. Andrew sensed her feeling of helplessness at being stopped from rescuing him. The sorrow on her face was powerful. To everyone else it looked like concern for her boyfriend, but Andrew and Sara knew it meant so much more.

Caressing Sara's face Andrew said, "I am so sorry, baby."

Despite her best effort a tear came to her eye as she leaned into his touch.

"What the hell were you thinking, Andrew?" His father's voice was intense and commanding as he looked at the diminutive young man in shocked frustration. "He could have seriously hurt you, or worse."

Andrew could see the confusion on everyone's faces. They struggled to understand why he pushed Will into such an extreme response. Everyone now understood that a lot of the burden of that attack rested on Andrew's shoulders.

"I knew that Will would keep doing this every day. That every attack would cause the students to think of me more and more as a victim. It's difficult enough knowing that no one thinks that I deserve such an amazing girlfriend."

Sara prepared to say something when Michelle cut her off, "How could you think this is any better, Andrew? Will would have stopped eventually, and you could have made friends. You always do."

"Yeah, who cares what these assholes think, Andrew?" Allison added, the genuine concern in her eyes looked unfamiliar.

"At what point are you going to stop worrying about what everyone else thinks?" Sara's voice showed her annoyance through the worry on her face.

Andrew sighed. "You guys don't understand. I have gone through that at so many other schools. I ignore the bullies, and yeah, eventually they get bored or just give up. But it changes the way people see you, it changes the way they treat you."

Looking at his parents Andrew said, "You risked your careers to give me this opportunity, and I am not going to squander it by living some hollow existence."

His parents looked surprised at the revelation that Andrew knew, at least on some level, the sacrifice they were willing to make for his chance at a normal life. He had never portrayed his knowledge to them, and they had been careful not to reveal this secret to him.

Andrew took Sara's hand and kissed it. "I want us to have a happy and meaningful life here." He smiled at Allison before continuing, "And I don't want to be a burden to my friends."

Allison was flustered by her conflicting emotions. Gratitude swelled up, overshadowing her melancholy desire to keep everyone at arm's length. No matter how much she tried, she had never been able to shake Sara's friendship. Eventually she came to value the overt woman, knowing that Sara would always be there for her. Now she realized that Sara's boyfriend had managed to squirm his way into her life similarly.

His parents found themselves admiring Andrew for his strength of will and dedication to what he wanted. They had always known that he was intelligent and resilient, but they had never known to what extents he would go for the things that he wanted. Between his PE class and now this bully, they were starting to get an even deeper understanding of the man they had raised.

Michelle asked, "That's commendable Andrew, but how did you know that pushing Will into attacking you would accomplish this result?"

"To be honest, I didn't. My plan was to stand up to Will and hope that Dad and Mr. Spencer would be able to teach me to defend myself before things got too intense. My goal was to learn enough that attacking me would not be worth the risk. There is nothing scarier for a bully than losing a fight to a peon, especially one as small and seemingly helpless as me.

"Of course, when he knocked my project out of my hand, ruining it, I knew that I needed to stand up to him. I couldn't win, but he needed to know that I was not afraid of him. The fact that so many people were there to witness it guaranteed that word would spread about what happened."

Andrew smiled as he looked at Allison. "I couldn't have guessed how terribly distorted the story would become, but I am happy that at least the basic message remained. I figured that the pressure from the other students would cause him to at least back off the intensity of the attacks. In a lot of ways this worked out much better than I had planned."

He let out an ironic laugh as he rubbed his tender ribs. "At least in some ways."

Everyone giggled with nervous smiles. Hours of frustration and worry melting away with every moment.

"Well at least that is behind us now." Michelle said as everyone relaxed. Sara gave Andrew's back an affectionate rub as she watched him with pride. Everyone dug back into their dinner and conversation turned to much lighter topics.
