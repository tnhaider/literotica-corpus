 Author's note: As requested, here is a cast of the characters of the story, at least through the soiree at Indian House. I don't perceive any additional characters (at least not any significant ones) being added afterwards. Also, even though the father of the character Deedra Helmholtz was a very real mathematician, to the best of my knowledge, he never had a daughter named Deedra. The same is also true of the Metetini, the fictional grandniece of the very real explorer, Sir Samuel White Baker.
