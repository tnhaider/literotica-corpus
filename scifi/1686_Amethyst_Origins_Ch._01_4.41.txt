 Author's Note: Hey everyone! First off, I want to thank you with all my heart for opening this chapter and reading it. I hope that you enjoy reading this chapter as much as I enjoyed writing it. I'm a true superhero/heroine fan to the core. Antiheroes and vigilantes are my favorite because even though they don't really have to live by a code they do. This is because they feel like they've become worse than the villains they are hunting if they don't follow this code. I always enjoy feedback and ratings. Please let me know what you think negative/positive. Enjoy this adventure!
