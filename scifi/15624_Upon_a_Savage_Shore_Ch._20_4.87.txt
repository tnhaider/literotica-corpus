 Author's note 9/20/2014: I'm at a stage where I am editing and wrapping things up. The plot is set and no major changes will be taking place, so it is safe for me to post this chapter and keep my readers satisfied.

One comment and a couple of messages on the last chapter have confused me somewhat. They referred to "novel length" or 'novel length stories". I would like to clear that up. Modern novels fall into the 100,000 word range for a first time novelist. I exceeded that between chapters 17 and 18. Currently 'Upon a Savage Shore' is over 140,000 words and may exceed 175,000 words before it is complete. Novel length - Not only have I been there and done that, I have the T-shirt on order. ;)

Thanks to everyone for their encouragement. Very much appreciated, I assure you.
