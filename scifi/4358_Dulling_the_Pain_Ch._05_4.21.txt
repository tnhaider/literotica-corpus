 Twenty minutes' walk from camp, Manuel addressed thin air.

"You hear everything, don't you, Flora? Maybe not in the ship, but if you really are this world, you must be able to hear me right now."

No response. He didn't expect one.

"When Cap vanished, all Maria would tell me was that something went wrong. She hasn't said anything about what happened to Isaac. Flora, what happened to them? Where are they?"

A now-familiar feeling ran through his head.

"I'm not letting you into my mind again. Bring back Isaac! I need to know what's going on!" He didn't know if it was a mistake, showing emotion to a creature like Flora, but at this moment, he didn't care. "I just need to know if Isaac's okay."

He did not know it, but at that moment, Flora was preoccupied with another matter.
