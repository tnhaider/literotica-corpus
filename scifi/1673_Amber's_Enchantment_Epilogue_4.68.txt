 Epilogue

Dreams and Visions

Silene started casting a movement spell to push Tyrene away from the shadow, and Amber threw up her hands and screamed, "No! Go away!" Amber's unconscious spell forced not just the shadow in front of her away, but every shadow on Destran too. When the shadow's weapon was suddenly pushed back to its nothing realm, the drain on Amber's mana stopped being a steady stream of energy, but an abrupt yanking of her entire body of mana in one fell swoop.

The shadows had a good reason for not designing their weapon to do just that from the beginning. In living creatures, their mana was tightly bonded to who they were; their soul, for lack of a better term. Amber's entire being was jerked out of her body intact; and still aware. Across Destran, sentient, but not fully conscious entities grasped at the opportunity for which they had been waiting for over a decade of centuries as they protected the lives of their charges. No one noticed that every slave across the face of the planet stopped what they were doing for a second, as their collars worked a desperate magic; a magic that might well stop the destruction of their own existence.
