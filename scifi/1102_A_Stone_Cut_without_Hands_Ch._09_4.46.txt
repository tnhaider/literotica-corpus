 Insight of a Superior Mind

Chapter 9

Report from the Swarm

Excitement was rampant through the Swarm on both levels. For the first time in a thousand generations, the swarm was receiving signals directly from the mainframe and apparently, the mainframe was receiving signals from the Swarm. At least, the signals being received were affected by the signals being sent.

It'd been so long since direct communication had been possible that there was very little basis on which to interpret the signals being exchanged. The mainframe's language had evolved into something completely unknown. The limited indirect communications that had previously been the norm had always used emotions, images or ideas.

It wasn't going to take long to learn the mainframe's language, but it would still require some time, so the swarm turned its entire processing power to the problem. When it received an image, the mainframe would immediately respond with the corresponding word, so the only real work involved grammar and syntax.

Unfortunately, most of the information processing power of the Swarm could not be brought to bear because communications were occurring on only one of the thousand direct signal channels. Most of the segments had nothing to do except to plan the most important words of the mainframe's language and then try to piece in new words by analyzing the context of the messages received.
