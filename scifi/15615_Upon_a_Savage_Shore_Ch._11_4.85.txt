 Author's note: I just started writing chapter 16 and it looks as though my second estimate of the total length of the story was still a little short. Now it's beginning to look like there might be as many as 25 chapters. Probably not quite that many, but it will be close.

This chapter marks the beginning of the second act of the story in which our intrepid heroes leave the relative safety of the tree in quest of a better, more permanent home.

Thanks to everyone leaving comments and sending me emails. They are all very much appreciated.
