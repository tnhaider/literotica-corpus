Please start with Parts 1 through 6, and 7. Many events in this chapter won't make any sense unless you know how the characters got here.

Summary so far: Andrea is a witch. She casts her spells by wiggling her clitoris instead of her nose. She doesn't always like the consequences of her craft, and it's time she did something about it.
