 As I sat around the fire with my parents my thoughts returned to the darkness and hatred I had felt. The uneasy feeling had never left and now was twisting a knot in my stomach. I tried to enjoy the warmth and company of the evening. Taking note of my mood, Mother began to braid my hair, short though it was.

Our pleasure was interrupted by a horrible scream. Jumping up I ran towards the door, behind me came my father. â€˜What the bloody hell?" My father reached for the door. "Where did that come from?" I reached out to stop him. Watching out the window I couldn't see anything. There was a gathering darkness around the barn that I had never seen before.

"Maybe I should go alone." It was a statement more then a question. Reaching for my dagger I left by the door I opened the door slowly. "I'll be right back." I said softly as I stepped out.

My heart raced as I crossed to the barn. The closer to the barn I got, the less I could see. A sudden wave of emotion took over me. Compared to the feelings of earlier, this was like a shock wave through my body. My blood ran cold through my veins and every muscle in my body was tense.

Before opening the barn door I looked back to the house. I may have been thousands of meters away, I couldn't see anything. As I turned back toward the barn the smell of blood and death began to seep through the planks. Suddenly the doors burst open.

A black creature stood in front of me. It stood like a man but it resembled a wolf. Blood dripped from its mouth and over its chest matting the already snarled fur.

My vision began to blur. Something deep inside me came alive with hatred and the desire to kill. My motions came naturally as the beast sprang at my. With a thud it fell to the ground.

There was a faint scream. Was that me? No, I turned toward the house. Three of the black monsters were running full force towards the door.
