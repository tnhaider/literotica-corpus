 After feeding on Shakron's essence two more times with her mouth, the red demon on which Fay had been turned understood that there wasn't much left of the man for that night, as when she was in the middle of her third comeback she realized that Shakron had passed out.

"What a shame... I thought we could have so much fun..."

Fay cleaned the spare drops of white juice on her face with wide licks of her long blue tongue, savoring the sweet taste of the leftovers. She stood up, leaving the body of her night mate in the ground, seeing how Shakron's body was returning to his human shape.

"Hmmm..."

She looked down to her pussy. It was still soaking wet and she saw some drops of her own cum falling onto the ground. She took her hands down, brushing the red skin of her abdomen along the way till she reached for her opening. 

Her fingers sank into her moist cum and then moved her fingers away, placing her hand before her eyes, gazing at the sticky substance.

It was pellucid and had a strong smell, a mix of her own scent and Shakron's cum combined with the sweat of both. She couldn't resist and used her tongue to reach for the sweet prize, licking her own fingers and diving into the sweet taste of sex.

"Ah... If you could only give me more..." she moaned. "Now I'll have to seek another source of life force..."

Fay used her sharp darkened nails to tear apart the remnants of her clothes and strip herself, leaving her body completely naked.

It was a cold night, but she didn't care, she was fire and lust and that would keep her warm till she found a new source of heat.

She took a quick look over her head, glancing with her shiny blue eyes at the windows and service ladders that were all around the alley's walls. After deciding for one, she jumped into the closest ladder and began climbing up to the roof. From there she would have a better vision of the city and of her next victim.
