 The Emerald Scholar's Book for Lovers - Stories from Bedo Street

Chapter 1: The Telling of the Dragon's Game

My name is Azel Fairbanks, also known in some circles as the Emerald Scholar. I have gained a reputation for writing stories about the interactions between my own human race and the magically inclined flying beasts known as dragons. Sometimes I write about the more...exotic interactions I hear about.

The general populace of my country of birth considers dragons as monsters, creatures of destruction and hatred spawned from the great Lord of Evil himself. Through my particular experiences, I discovered that this view was naively incorrect: dragons tend to be the nicest, happiest, and most loving beings you could ever meet. Based on my own experiences, I would say my own race tended towards wickedness, not the other way around. I almost laugh every time some herder blames a dragon for eating his sheep because I know they are not meat eaters.

In a nation I visited across the sea, people held dragons in high regard. They told stories about them and those humans who entered their culture. Some of my favorite stories came from the husband of a happy couple living on Bedo Street in the northern territories of that land. His wife, my wife, my dragon friend, and his dragon friend all came around to sit in and listen while he dictated the stories to me. The first story he told was how he met his wife, which I have titled "The Telling of the Dragon's Game."
