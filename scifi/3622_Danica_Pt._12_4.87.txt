 Author's Notes:
This story is erotic fantasy, set in a world of magic.  I reserve the right to be listed as the author of this work, wherever it is posted.  If found posted anywhere except Literotica.com with this note attached, this story is posted without my permission.  Â© Darkniciad 2000-2007

The sexual situations in this story will be far ranging, and may prove disturbing to some readers.  Please be warned that the villains of the story are really evil, and the things they do are not glossed over, or toned down.

I make use of modern weights and measures quite often in my work, because those are the weights and measures of my fantasy world.  I know many fantasy readers prefer more archaic terms, and I hope those readers can overlook my use of miles, feet, and other such measures.

You really need to read the previous parts of the story to know the characters and the storyline.  This tale follows Danica in her day-to-day adventures, with the greater plot emerging slowly at first.  Think of it more as a serial than a novel, and you'll be in the right mindset.

This is an edited version of this tale, making use of what I've learned since starting to post at Literotica, and the services of my tireless editor, Roust Writer.

Danica saw a tray on her bed when she returned to her rooms.  She ignored it, slipping out of her robe and into a bath.  She didn't waste any time, she simply washed and then dressed.

Once she was dressed, she picked up the two healing draughts and jar of salve on the tray.  She put them in pockets of her robe, followed by the skin she would use to flush Marlena's depths, and then picked up the note on the tray.
