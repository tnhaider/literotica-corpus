 Hello there folks, and thanks for checking out my story!

While this is not my first foray into the world of erotic storytelling, it is my first time wrestling with this particular subgenre (i.e. the harem-style fantasy epic). I struggled a bit to settle on a posting category, as this tale spans several in terms of its theming (e.g. romance, nonhuman, mind control, and nonconsent). But I do try and keep the content balanced and I believe that the sci-fi/fantasy subsection fits best overall. So, here we are.

BTW, if you have any constructive criticism for me, I would love to hear from you. I know not all authors on this site are open to being bashed, but I'm here (at least in part) to get better and I can't do that without feedback. So please, have at it! I promise you, I can take it and will be immensely grateful for any insight you can provide. If there seems to be interest in the storyline, I'll begin releasing chapters in regular intervals. I do have a decent amount of additional content already finished, but it still needs to be polished and I was getting impatient to post, lol.

Disclaimer: All characters depicted in sexual situations are 18+. And noncon, while great in the context of a fantasy, is never okay outside of that context. Remember that in real life, consent should be informed, enthusiastic, and ongoing.
