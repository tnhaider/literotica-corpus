Zahra had been struggling all day with the growing feeling of pleasure within her body. That shameless whore! Zahra thought as she tried to push out the other part of her that had reintegrated with her. Even as she pushed she felt another strong wave of pleasure wash over and through her. 

Breathing hard she again pushed hard as she felt her vagina start to leak copious amounts of fluid. Cursing she felt another wave of pleasure hit her then she fell to the ground. Trying to get up only made it worse as her vagina began to throb then she had a huge orgasm! 

Snarling she cursed at the part of herself that she had hoped to have been destroyed. [You whorey bitch! How dare you use MY body like you did! I will destroy you if it's the last thing I do! I will never succumb to these longings for a male! Never do you hear me?] 

From deep within Zahra heard a laugh, [You'll never be rid of me! I am in possession of a far more powerful magic than you will ever possess. I will make you feel it every day 'til you submit!] 

[Never you whorey bitch! This is my body I won't have it used for the debauchery that y...y... STOP IT! NO!] Zahra screamed inside as she felt an even larger orgasm sweep through her. Falling to her knees panting a sudden idea formed, an idea that made her smile evilly. Yes! She thought it has to work! It will work then I'll bend that bastard human to my will. Laughing even harder she started to chant calling up every ancient power spell that she could. 

_____________________________________________________________ 

Jake and Tankena had been discussing a great many things though they talked the most about the trio. They also had lengthy talks about Marie and Zahra. Tankena thought over what Jake had accomplished reinstalling the thrown away personality. 

"I know that you greatly increased its power, though as strong as Zahra is it may fail. Even if as the Jinn Inger said the other completely rejoined the main body. I am afraid it may be destroyed." Tankena told all of them there. 

"Even if she has love?" Juno asked. "From all that Jake has said she has that on her side." 

Tankena was silent a moment then spoke up. "If as you say the other has love truly in their heart then we may have a chance. Master Jake." Tankena said as he bowed to the floor in front of Jake. "I know you have no alliance with me; I know I haven't proved that I am on your side. I am a wanted Jinn on both sides of this war. The best I can hope for is a quick death from my brother and the council." 

Jake smiled a huge smile as he looked at all that were there. He already knew that Tankena had changed. If he could he would speak for Tankena when the time came. For the present Tankena had provided far more information than Jake had during this whole war. Yes he'd speak for him though he wasn't sure what he could do for him. 

Looking at all eight of the other Jinns plus Mary and Juno, Jake ran what he wanted to say through his head. 

"Alright I think I've come to a decision." Jake said as he addressed all of the others there. Tankena was still bowed to the floor not really expecting mercy nor leniency. Even though Master Jake was the Ever Last Master he expected nothing but scorn. It had been that way for him all of the thousands of years of his existence. 

"I willingly will accept whatever you wish Master Jake. I am through running, trying to survive. A quick end of my being by my brother and the council will be kind compared to what the others will do to me." Tankena said from the floor never raising his head up. Jake could only shake his head, what was it with Jinns obsessed with death and being killed? 

"As I said I have come to a decision about Tankena. As each of you know I can tell what is in the heart of almost all Jinns." All ten of the Jinns and the humans nodded their heads. "I have seen into Tankena's heart," looking at Sheeka he continued. "As with you Sheeka, Tankena was forced, for the most part, to follow what the ex-Queen wanted him to do. Am I right Tankena?" 

Without rising from the floor they heard Tankena's muffled voice. "Many things were her bidding Master Jake, though there were a few that were of my own volition." 

Jake nodded it was as he thought much like Sheeka he'd not had that much will. Looking at Tankena's wrists and arms Jake wished that they would slowly start to heal. Looking at the others he saw that they were slowly starting to realize just what Jake was up to. 

"Tankena, arise so I am not speaking to the back of your head." Jake said as he watched Tankena tentatively raise his head off the floor. "Now as I said I have made a decision about you. I see that you truly wish to change. I will stand with you before the council, though for now I think you need to rest, regain your power and strength." 

Tankena's face showed only shock as he looked at the also shocked faces of the others gathered there. "Master Jake I do not deserve what you have said. I will accept the death I know is awaiting me. You..." 

"So I take it you are refusing the help I am freely giving to you? You actually wish to die? You really think so little of your life that you think this way?" Jake asked a now shocked Tankena. 

"Master Jake I was responsible for many deaths. Though I had could have refused that being a death sentence." Tankena almost whispered. 

Mary stepped forward looking at the bowing Jinn. "Look you idiot! Jake is offering you a chance to live. Stop being such a stubborn ass and just say thank you Master Jake!" 

Tankena gulped at the furious look on Mary's face. Turning back to Jake he quietly said, "Uh thank you Master Jake?" 

"See? See how easy that was? Now sit there as Jake regales us with another brilliant plan!" Mary said her eyes boring holes in Tankena. 

Akeesha turned to Inger as she giggled. "Mistress is just as fierce with her love making also." Akeesha nodded then shivered remembering their last session with all three of them involved! "Then again she is an animal when it comes to Master Jake!" 

This time Akeesha blushed as she remembered she herself had been that way with Master Jake. Shivering again she felt her vagina start to leak at the thought of her time with Master Jake. 

Jake looked at Mary as she suddenly grew quiet seeing Jake staring at her. "Thank you Mary, I do have a plan, though I am afraid that it will be dangerous. I can't with a clear conscience ask any of you to do this." The concerned and worried looks he got from all of them gave him a start. 

"Master Jake," Gen started. "I think I speak for all of us when I say that we will do anything for you. No matter the danger we will do all we can for you." 

Shocked Jake looked at Gen, Rosalinda, Rashala, and Sheeka as they all nodded yes. All four had a look of fierce determination on their faces. It was even more of a shock when Jake saw the same look on the face of Akeesha and Inger. Then he saw that Mary, Juno, and then Amira also wore the same look. 

Shaking his head Jake replied. "I don't want anyone hurt again; several of you have been through this. I know all of you would do anything for me but I can't stand for any of you to be hurt again." Looking at Mary, Akeesha, Gen, Rosalinda, and Rashala he continued, "Especially with the five of you pregnant. I know you have recovered greatly Sheeka, though I also know you are still weak." Jake told Sheeka. 

"Master Jake, have you forgotten that we all are Jinns? We have a far faster recovery time than you think. Even though we are with child, our power is still as strong. With the trio out there, plus their leader has harnessed the dark magic, I think you need all of us as close as we can get." Sheeka said to which all those present nodded. 

Jake could only stand there shock on his face. They all loved him too much to allow him to be hurt. Still even 

with all of their combined powers Jake was afraid they still might be harmed. Sighing he nodded, "Alright! I know that there is no way I can keep all of you away. I want all of you to remember each and every one of you is precious to me, as are our children." 

"Master, as you said we have a great combined power. I can't remember the last time more than five Jinns combined their power for one being, plus the fact of our love for you and yours for us." Gen said then turned to Akeesha. "I know that you have feelings for Master Jake now. As I can feel you have developed feelings for her Master Jake." 

Akeesha's mouth dropped open as she was afraid to look at Inger. She was afraid that she might find a look of disgust on her face. Suddenly a hand gently turned Akeesha's face to Inger. Seeing the look of worry on Akeesha, Inger smiled. 

"My love, I know. I've known for a while. I am glad that you have discovered these feelings. I also know that I was your first love, and that will never change." Leaning over Inger whispered in Akeesha's ear. "I have also developed feelings for Master Jake though I know it isn't love. I feel more that I now have a brother that I have been missing all my life." 

Akeesha got a shocked look on her face then grabbed Inger in a loving embrace. She then started plying kisses all over her face. Finally Akeesha took Inger's face in her hands then moved in kissing her with all the passion she was feeling. Breaking the kiss a few moments later both were almost gasping for breath. 

Everyone was smiling when both Inger and Akeesha went to Jake holding him in a near bone crushing hug. Then they both gave Jake several kisses as they finally sat together. 

Shaking his head Jake reached in his shirt for the talisman calling the council. All twelve bowed to Jake, Juno, and Mary as soon as they appeared. Rasmir stepped forward, "You called for us Master Jake?" 

"Yes I have a dilemma, plus I am afraid that it concerns you personally as well as the council." Jake could see that the council was starting to grow uneasy from something that they were feeling. "First I want to say that we are all safe. What you are all feeling was the presence of Rasmir's brother." 

There were several hisses as almost all of the council started to power up. Rasmir started to look Jake all over, "Are you alright Master Jake? Were you attacked?" 

Sighing Jake shook his head. "First all I am fine, second I have uh... made a sort of alliance with Tankena." 

"WHAT!!? Master Jake please forgive me, have you lost your mind?" Rasmir and the council were erecting a shield as fast as they could. 

"Rasmir move away from him!" The leader of the council was yelling. 

A sudden look of anger swept over Jake's face as he saw that the council members were in a panic. Turning to Rasmir it was his turn to be surprised when he saw the smile on the older Jinn's face. "So, he has finally freed himself from the slave bands." Jake started to nod as this was spoken as a statement and not a question. 

"You knew?" Jake asked befuddled by this turn of events. 

Nodding Rasmir moved closer to Jake. "Of course he came to me not long after they were applied to him. With the power he had I thought they wouldn't have been as effective as they were. Little did I know that it was Queen Qistina, with the royal power behind her to enslave him. It is no small wonder that brother is alive trying to fight that amount of power." 

Jake was nodding then stated, "He told me why he did it. It seems he wished to seek a position like you had on the council. He thought that it would make him strong enough. He soon found out that he was almost a slave to the queen. One thing he told me does have me worried. Zahra offered Nuha of the deadly trio a power greater than the dark magic." 

Rasmir's eyes went wide when Jake relayed this information. Turning away a moment Rasmir was deep in thought. "Is it possible? I shudder to think if she has mastered it." 

Jake looked at Rasmir wondering what the older Jinn was on about. "What has you so afraid?" Jake asked a moment later. 

"Sorry Master Jake it's an old, very old magic that has been outlawed for as long as I can remember. It was used to such an extent that it was banned from ever being used again. It's said that no living creature could resist it." 

Ok Jake thought his curiosity peaked now. "What is this magic that it is so powerful? Plus why am I suddenly afraid that I am the one it will be used against?" 

Rasmir was still deep in thought almost ignoring Jake. Shaking his head he stared at Jake, "Sorry Master Jake if she does know it, all may be lost. What I am referring to is the ancient love magic. It got so bad that at one point the Great Jinn put a stop to it. I shudder to think what Zahra could do with it." 

Jake was nodding then stopped, "Knows what?" 

"I'm sure you have heard of love potions and spells?" Rasmir asked. When Jake nodded he continued. "Back then the magic was so strong almost no one could resist it. As I said it took the great Jinn to finally beat it. I just hope that she doesn't know of it." 

Jake nodded he hoped so as well, the last thing he'd ever want to do was hurt any of his Jinns. 

_______________________________________________________ 

Nuha stretched as she looked over at her sisters. She needed a male she could use to satisfy her like that bastard Ever Last Master had. A small smile lit up her face as she thought of him. Ummmmm she thought he had been so hard and strong, why weren't they all like that? 

Even as Nuha's thoughts were turning to Jake so it seemed, were her sisters. Fatin was practically awash with her own lubrication that was leaking from her vagina. Abla it seemed was faring no better as her thoughts were now focused on one thing only. How in the hell she was going to get Master Jake buried within her as soon as possible. 

All three of the sisters were starting to twitch uncomfortably when they all heard a wicked laugh. "I told you I 

had a power far more powerful than your dark magic." Zahra told all of them. "I still need you to get me close to that bastard though now." Here Zahra smiled evilly, "you have no choice in the matter." 

Nuha hissed as she tried to chant to no avail as nothing escaped her lips but a pant. "What have you done you bitch!" Nuha managed to get out. 

"My, my, you are far stronger than I thought," Zahra said as she waved her hand in a strange pattern. 

Nuha's eyes went wide then her body started to convulse as a major orgasm gripped her. Her two sisters started to advance on Zahra who smiled saying, "Master Jake." 

Both stopped dead still panting, then both screamed convulsing as they also were swept up in huge orgasms themselves. 

With a wicked smile Zahra waved her hand making Marie appear. Sitting down behind Zahra she too smiled wickedly. "Now that we have your attention, I think it's about time we plan to rid the world of that pretentious bastard." 

Zahra smiled even bigger, let that asshole fight her now! Laughing inside she couldn't wait for him to bow before her servicing her whims to no end! Just the thought of it was exciting her. 

"So I believe we have a weapon against him. What better way to fight," here Marie pulled a face. " Love, than with love. All we need is for all three of you to get close to him. The ancient love magic should do the rest!" Laughing again Marie thought of her ex husband beneath her feet serving her.
