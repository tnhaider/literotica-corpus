 Sorry, no detailed sex in this one. This is where I wrap up the plot. (Please tell me you care about the plot.)

Also, the chapter descriptions are from the Disney movie The Little Mermaid--specifically the song "Poor Unfortunate Souls."




On the day before the supply ship was scheduled to land, Manuel finally opened the door.

"I've been alone for a month and a half," he told Maria, who'd been sitting amidst the flowers not far from the ship. "I'm starting to wonder if I'm crazy."

"You were crazy to lock yourself away like that," Maria told him. "And for a while, I was crazy for you. I'd almost given up hope." She stood, and she reached out to him . . .

"Please, not now. Not yet."

Maria glared at him. "Damn you, do you have any idea how much you've hurt me? You told me you loved me, and then you treated me like a monster! So I waited and waited for you to come around, and now . . ."

Manuel's voice stayed soft, neither accepting nor rejecting her words. "I don't know you any more, but I want to. Not in that way--I mean--I just want to talk to you."

From the tone of Maria's voice, it was clear that she considered that an apology--and that she'd rejected it. "Talk, then."

"How's Cat doing?"

"She's the happiest of us three. She doesn't think much about past or the future--she just wants to make everything a little more chaotic." From there, she unfolded an anecdote about Ida's attempts to study the effects of metal shears on the local plant life, and about how Cat had ruined the study without even trying. This reminded Manuel of something he'd tried to relieve the boredom inside the ship, and in an hour's time, the two had begun to remember how they'd fallen in love.
