 Hey everyone! At the current time of writing this the first part of "The Orphans" is at a 4.4/5 rating, with 10 rating submissions, 2 comments and 831 views, which is a lot more than I was actually expecting. If you liked part one, I hope you'll love part 2, in which I went more in-depth with the characters personalities, the world detail, and of course, the love making. Enjoy! As an extra note: with this once I've tried to make the pacing much better, but it's a bit difficult for me to completely notice it due to my being the writer, if I ever find someone to look these over for me, I will do so, but currently this isn't possible. As with part 1 if this little series is still being enjoyed by people than it will continue to flourish, thank you for those who have given me feedback and those who enjoyed the story all the same!
