 Author's Note: Getting very close to the end. This is not the last chapter. There will be at least one more, perhaps two. However, this is a good long one and should satisfy the cravings of those wanting "moar".

As for a sequel or another story in this particular universe, I am undecided. I have two other projects I need to devote some serious time to and there are the usual concerns of real life I must attend to. This was fun and surprisingly rewarding, but making a living does come first (as do some home repairs).

Thanks to everyone who left comments and sent messages. I hope you enjoy this chapter. I will post the next when I have finished my real life tasks and have more time to edit.
