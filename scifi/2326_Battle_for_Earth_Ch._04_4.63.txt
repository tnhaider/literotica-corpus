**Yaounde, Cameroon**

Central Africa, Region 18

Eposi and Methild were prepared to film a video response and post it on the once famous and popular app, Message-the-World, after viewing Brandon and Miyuki's introductory video. They were the couple in charge of Australia and Oceania. The present couple was inside of the solarium of the Cameroonian palace, sitting together. They stared back at the screen of her light-based phone that was recording them. 

"Move closer to me, Methild," she sweetly told him.

The drow did as she asked of him. Both were sitting on a couch, staring back at the screen of the phone she was holding up in front of both of them.

"Hi everyone, my name is Eposi Nzola. I am contacting everyone from my native homeland of Cameroon. I currently live in the capital city of my country, Yaounde. I am also living with this handsome dark man sitting beside me. He's the partner God saw fit to pair me up with. Um, maybe you should introduce yourself for this part."

Eposi handed the phone to Methild who held it up in front of him instead of above him.

"Greetings to ye all who are watching this memory captured in motion. My name is Methild Keawenys. If ye do not know what I am, then let me save you the trouble of guessing. I am a drowâ€”a dark elf who lived below the surface. And as Eposi just finished sharing with you all. I am her assigned partner. Though I am certain this was not the work of some almighty deity. And now I pass the message back to my beloved partner. Here Eposi."

"I and Methild are making this video response to reach out to all of you, whoever might be watching this, and to give us an invite. When I woke up and looked around my neighborhood and the rest of my city, I believed I was the only person still alive until meeting this man here. I am not alone anymore, and for that I thank God." 

"If you have a phone or a holo-tablet or any light-based product, and you come across this video. Send me your contact information so I can add you to my list of contacts so we can talk." Eposi finished recording and waved goodbye. Methild saved back at screen awkwardly. 

She uploaded the video to MtW immediately.

Thirty minutes later after uploading her video response to MtW. They received a response from Brandon, the sole survivor In all of Australia. He sent her his contact information which Eposi immediately added to her list of contacts. Afterward, they began talking to one another.

Gazing back at another living human being for the first time during a live feed was a welcome sight and relief for both Eposi and Brandon. But at first sight, both humans felt a sharp tugging sensation in their throats and inside of their ears at the same time. It came as quickly as it shot through them, and the two dismissed it as nothing but nervousness and the shock of seeing another living human. 

Miyuki stood back and allowed her partner to have this time to talk to Eposi. Methild too hanged back to the side. 

When Brandon greeted Eposi, Miyuki heard him speak in French, not in English. Methild found it odd that Eposi's response was in English, not In French. Cameroon was a country of two languages, English and French. But Eposi only in French, and never bothered to learn English. The two nonhumans knew something strange was amiss with their partners' sudden changed in language preferences. It did not appear to dawn on either human until after some time had passed. 

"Hey, Eposi can I ask you something. How are you able to understand me right now? Do Cameroonians speak English also?"

"We do, but I never learned to speak it myself. French is my main language. But you're talking to me in French too, so I'm guessing you know it too correct?"

"What? No, I'm speaking to you in English, aren't I Miyuki?" Brandon asked his partner behind him.

"You were speaking in her native language. When you asked me your question, you spoke to me in English. Whenever you seem to face and speak to the other human, your language changes surprisingly fast. It's quite terrifying because it came from nowhere."

"Wait, seriously? How is that even possible?!" he asked himself, baffled. Miyuki only shrugged her shoulders.

Brandon turned back around to face Eposi on his holo-screen, "Eposi ask your partner if he hears a difference when you speak to me." 

She looked off to her left and asked him. "Methild do you hear a difference when I speak to Brandon compared when I speak to you?"

"Aye, I do. Tis strange" he answered.

"I guess it is true then Brandon. Your speaking to me in French and I'm speaking to you in English. But whatever power is behind this, let's not let it get in the way of this amazing moment between us. This is going to sound like a stupid question this late into our situations, but you don't know what might have happened to our world, would you?"

"Your guess would be as good as mine sister. I was asleep when this strange event affected everyone else in Australia. When I woke up, I wander aimlessly in my city looking for someone else. I just really needed someone to talk to. The silence in the streets was just too deafening for me. The only thing that brought some measure of normalcy was that domestic animals and wild animals have not been affected by whatever or whoever did this to our world."

Eposi looked pensive on her side of the live feed. Regardless, she still felt relieved just to be able to talk to another human being. 

"Do you think other human survivors are connecting like us, Brandon?"

"I can't say for certain if they are or aren't. But if they are contacting each other like this, I only hope they don't take too long contacting us also. It be nice to see who else survived this silent mess. What I'm more interested in is how they managed to survive and who their partners are."

"We could even help those still trying to cope with this new reality. Thank God for technology" Eposi said.

"Yeah, but could you imagine if this had happened two, three centuries ago? There would be no way for us to face-time with each other" Brandon added.

Both of them shared laughs and a short sense of relief and joy in their conversation. But neither Miyuki or Methild appreciated this. They were glad their partners were finally able to speak to one another, but the longer they let them speak; the more they felt they might lose them. The snow-woman went over to her partner to cut this face-time short. 

"All right, time's up Brandon. You can talk to your friend some other time. The future lord of Australia and Oceania needs to focus on other important matters right now."

"Hey, Hey! Excuse me, I'm not done talking to him!" Eposi said angrily. 

Miyuki's face seemed to change from serene and sweet to dark, crazy and even slightly demonic on a dime. 

"The next time you want to talk to my husband-to-be woman, show him the proper respect that is owed to him. You will refer to him as 'Lord of Australia and Oceania' next time!"

Methild who had a few run-ins with demons in his world was not frightened by Miyuki in the slightest bit. And he had a few hard words for the snow-woman trying to cut this meeting short.

"How dare you show such an ugly face to my wife-to-be you pale corpse of a woman! Human man, reign in your pale bitch of a wife! The next time you two meet like this, address her with her proper titles too. 'Lady of Central Africa' got it?!" 

Miyuki was offended and turned her deadly gaze at the male drow in front of the holo-screen. 

"How dare you compare me to a corpse! Your skin Is as dark as black sand. Get away from us you horrible creature of the darkness!" Miyuki shot back.

Both humans placed something on top of their phones to make the holo-screen go away temporarily, while they took a moment to calm their partners down. With their nonhuman partners out of the room, both humans resumed their face-time.

"I'm really sorry about that Eposi. Guess I have a dangerously jealous one on my hand, lucky me huh. Listen I already have your contact information and you have mine now. Let's talk again soon. If I don't get off now Miyuki might freeze the entire house with me in it."

"Same here," Eposi giggled, "I don't think Methild is a savage elf, but he might end up really damaging the palace we're inside of. Before we say goodbye for now, maybe we should form an alliance between our two regions."

"How exactly would that work? I don't think we can leave our countries just yet, so there's no way for us to meet in person."

"What makes you say that Brandon?"

"It's just a feeling that I've been getting as of lately. I guess an alliance, for now, could work between our two regions for now. There's no telling how many other alliances have already been established as we speak. First I need to speak with my beloved wife-to-be about this. Talk to you later my friend, stay safe."

"You too Brandon, you take care of yourself too."

**Mexico City, Mexico**

Mexico, Region 2

Inside the national palace of Mexico in the Mexican capital city. Menja and Oscar were inside one of the many bedrooms inside the palace. The tiny infernal imp was redecorating the room with her infernal powers for one out of many of their future hybrid children. The former marine, on the other hand, was watching Brandon and Miyuki's video on his light-based phone. He was taken captive by the snow-woman's supernatural beauty. Try as he might he just couldn't pull his eyes away from her face. Luckily for him, his tiny infernal lover Gibb slapped him and knocked him out of the trance her beauty put him under.

"Ow!" he said, rubbing the back of his head.

Menja wrapped her small arm around his chest, resting her chin in the crook of his neck and stared back at the holo-screen of his phone. 

"She's a snow-woman Oscar. Or what the Japanese call a 'Yokai' which translates to 'ghost' 'phantom' or 'strange apparition'. Her kind inhabits

snowy mountains or wherever there is snow. I guess I should say, 'used' to inhabit, given that her kind has also been taken, leaving only just her. They spend most of their time hunting humans, devouring their life force by sucking it out of them which always freezes the person solid. Their species is composed of only females. You see this species of phantom humanoids are born from the souls of dead women or girls who die on snowy mountains who are never found and are forgotten in time. Missing and fading from their family and friends memories causes the soul to grieve and seek physical form from its surroundings; snow, mist & ice. When they have that physical body, they use it to vent their rage and sadness. They are a one a kind type of spirit because they defy the law of death, by forcing themselves back to life, even if it is at a great cost.

Sometimes a snow-woman will fall in love with a man and marry him. And even rarely, bear him some children in the process of falling in love. Yes, they can bear children, despite basically being revenants. But even after their husbands learn that their supernaturally beautiful wives never seem to age like they do, the happy marriage turns sad and tragic. Their beauty affects men and only men. They are a strictly heterosexual species of supernatural beings."

"That explains her beauty and the hold it had on me. You know something Menja, you're really intelligent. Its like I have my own walking, talking monster encyclopedia with me. Speaking about supernatural beauty, can you also do that?"

"What? Turn into a snow-woman? pfft, of course!"

"No, what I meant was can you make yourself supernaturally beautiful."

"Well sure I can. Or I can also put the belief in your head and make you think I'm the most beautiful and sexiest woman you have ever laid eyes on. But I don't need cheap tricks to get what I want, because I already got what I want; you."

Oscar blushed and looked away. 

"Yeah but still, I was the only man left in Mexico, so naturally we were going to come together at one point or another. Besides, unlike in the beginning, you don't look that terrifying to me anymore" he said, turning to face her and wrapping an around her back.

"You clean up pretty nicely after putting on some clothes, washing your hair and straightening it. Before it was just filled with nothing but knots and unkempt."

The tiny imp blushed innocently at these words. She was taken by surprise from him again. Regardless, she smirked mischievously back at him. She tugged on his cheek and pressed a kiss on his lips, which burned a little before subsiding. The two continued to watch the video while Menja caressed the back of his head with her tiny clawed fingers. At the end of the video, Oscar had a crazy idea he wanted to share with her.

"You know something Menja, let's make our own video, what do you think?"

"Eh, why?"

"To start making contact with other survivors of course, what else?" 

Menja blew a tired raspberry and agreed with her future husband. Oscar placed his phone down on the nightstand beside the bed. He pressed the camera app on his phone and pressed record. But to stand out from the other partners who already sent videos out into the world on their own, The small infernal imp pushed him back down on the bed so she was straddling him. She grabbed the phone from the nightstand, leaned forward on top of her man and focused on the screen of the phone recording her.

"Menja what the hell are you doudnghgn--"

The tiny imp pressed her hand down on top of her man's mouth, muffling his words as she started speaking in front of the camera. He grabbed her wrist and tried to remove her hand away by sheer force. Even though all areas of her body looked small and were small, they were not fragile nor weak. Trying to move her hand away from his mouth felt like trying to move a mountain resting on top of him with his weak human hands and muscles. 

"Hello to every last surviving human and extra-dimensional humanoids who were dragged into this mess, myself included. My glorious name is Menja, and I am an ageless, deathless imp from hell. Yes, THAT hell. The man you see lying beneath me is my future husband Oscar Mariano. I gave him the endearing name, 'big dick,' because well I'll let you guess why. Nyahahaha. With that piece of information aside, the region known as Mexico belongs to me and my future husband! With his seed and my ovum, we will repopulate this part of the world with cambions who will take after their father's humanity and his mother's mischief and power. They will spread throughout all of Mexico until no corner is under our control! And when that happens, we'll be coming for the rest of the world, cambions for the win, ahahahaha!"

Oscar finally managed to push her off to the side of the bed and grabbed the camera from her hand. He sat up on the bed and pointed the screen of his camera in front of him and spoke. 

"Why the hell did you have to go and say all of that for? Now you're going to make these people hate us!"

"Yes Oscar, curse in the name of Hell, aaww it gives me power! Curse some more!" 

"Whatever! Listen, everybody, disregard everything you just heard my future wife tell you. She lacks a filter for her mouth, so she just lets whatever come out of there without thinking about it first. Like she said, my name is Oscar Mariano. I'm twenty-eight years old and before the end of the world, I used to be a former marine in the Mexican special forces. Right now it's just me and Menja here in Mexico. This video is a response video to Brandon and Eposi's videos. If you want to contact me, my phone number is... add me to your list of contacts and we can talk. Again, disregard everything my fiance told you. Also I--"

"WE!" Menja screamed from behind him, emphasizing the word.

"WE, look forward to talking with all of you." 

Oscar ended the recording and uploaded it using the MtW app. He placed his phone back down on the nightstand and laid down on the bed he was on. Menja crawled over to him and laid beside him, resting her short arm on top of his waist whilst staring up at the mural staring back down at them from the ceiling. The mural depicted the descent of angels from heaven and taking wives from among the daughters of men. Giants came from them and chaos and sin reigned on the earth for sometime before the flood did away with most of the corruption, most of it.

"Can I ask you something, Menja?"

"You can ask me anything, future husband."

"Why do all depictions of angels look like men? And are there any women angels among them?"

"That's a question with a lot of layers to remove. So where should I begin answering? I suppose I should start from the beginning. Are you hearing this old man! I'm going to reveal one of your biggest secrets to a lowly human man. And I'm not talking about that garbage those idiot watchers shared with the descendants of Adam and Eve! Okay, here we go. In the beginning, when Lord fart-pants began to create the universe, he created the first being in existence. You knew him as the devil or Satan. But to demons of all ranks, he was the most glorious and beautiful angel to ever exist. And his name was Lucifer. Now don't get jealous Oscar, but Lucifer is what you can call the perfect man."

"Why would I be jealous of him? He had everything going for him, but he bit off more than he could chew. If I were him I would accept my place in the plan of creation."

"Well, that's like your opinion. But he was in perfect In every way imaginable. So much so that all demons loved him. Female demons wanted to procreate with him. Male demons wanted to emulate him. He brought the first real sense of what it was to genuinely love someone and not being forced to by fear of expulsion. But I'm getting off track her. Lucifer was the first created being in all of pre-creation. His brothers were created secondly and his sisters were created thirdly. But his sisters were created at a much later time, on the eight day."

"Wait a second! There was an eight-day in creation?" Oscar asked quizzically.

"DAS RITE! There was a secret eight day that was never recorded for mankind to ever know about. Your rulers in the Vatican would not allow it permit it. Even lord douche bag himself forbade everyone, even Lucifer, from revealing this to anyone especially to humans. If he did, Lord ass-hat would not wait until the appointed time to destroy Lucifer; he would do away with him then and there if he or any demon or fallen angel uttered a word of it."

"Okay, okay I get. So what was so special about these angelic sisters?" Oscar asked, aching to know more.

"The book of Enoch says when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, beautiful daughters were born to them. And the sons of fuck-face saw them and came down and took wives and blah blah, giants are born to them, blah blah blah, sin and death pollutes the world so and so forth. But do you know why the sons of lord moldy butt took human wives? Because when captain jackass created female angels, his sons, their brothers became enamored with them at first sight. He expressly forbade contact between the male and female angels in heaven. When Semyaza asked him why they were not allowed to so much as speak to their sisters. Lord doofus-ass said they were to be the wives of his heroes, martyrs, and prophets on earth. The mere thought of heaven's daughters mating with lowly men drove not only Semyaza mad but also other angels. 

Then Semyaza got the crazy idea of taking two hundred of his brothers who shared his anger and jealousy for man. And the rest is history, written down in book Enoch wrote for a much later generation."

"Goodness gracious. It really makes you wonder what could have happened if things were different. So what happened to female angels in heaven, were they erased or destroyed?"

"Neither, Oscar. Some were allowed

to stay in a different heaven, inhabited your slave master's and his daughters. Two became his personal confidants. The rest were given the freedom to travel wherever they wished. Many became goddesses of different religions of the world. Others became something less more like the Norse Valkyries, European vampires and werewolves, Abrahamic demons, Greek nymphs and whatever name different cultures gave them."
