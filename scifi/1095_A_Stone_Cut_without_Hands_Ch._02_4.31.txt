Chapter 2

The Nest

Like the Swarm, the nest was a semi-independent sentient being. But it was as different from the swarm as night is different from the darkness of interstellar space. It was composed of about a hundred thousand individual components similar to gametes that each had 23 information processing lobes. One of the more radical differences was that its processors could not operate in parallel. It was actually more intelligent than the swarm because its processors operated on a number system with a base of 46. (The left digit of a two-digit number represents the digit times 46 as opposed to 10 for humans.)

Each gamete was also sentient and about as intelligent as a normal 8 year old. The ability of the gametes to share information was dramatically slower than the segments of the swarm, so the nest tended to be less capable of logical reasoning and more creative. The tendency towards creativity was enhanced by a long life span.

Even though the nest did not enjoy the same type of immortality that the Swarm possessed, it could pass on a portion of its memories to any new nest it helped establish. The establishment of a new nest was a process similar to the way bees form a new hive.

The partial inherited memory forced the nest to focus on non-linear or creative thought processes because there was always information missing for the formation of solutions using logic. Fortunately, a nest could exchange information with a swarm when the two were in close proximity for an extended period of time. This tended to form a bond or need to continue the association.
