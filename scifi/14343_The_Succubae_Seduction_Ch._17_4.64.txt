 Author's Note: Real quick, I know I usually do this at the end, but I really wanted to thank two people for their efforts in this story. Garbonzo607 as you know is my editor, he does an excellent job, and should really be commended for it. The time and effort he puts into this story, the blog, and everything else he does to make this story stand out is truly exemplary!

Also, SophieX deserves a shout out, for her ideas that went into this chapter. It's also thanks to her, that there has been more dialog and detail for the last while, than there was in the beginning chapters.

Now, without further ado, here is chapter 17!

After being captured by and escaping Orcs, a megalomaniacal dragon, an irate demon, chased by Cyclopes, and narrowly avoiding certain death at the hands of a light creature that wants to destroy all worlds, it's almost embarrassing to be taken into custody by something as mundane as the local police force.
