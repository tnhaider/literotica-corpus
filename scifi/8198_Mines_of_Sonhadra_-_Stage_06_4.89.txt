Stage 2-6: Maze Escape

I barely noticed that the PREG notification in my periphery was glowing red now.

I was completely naked, laying on the dirt floor of the maze, or labyrinth, or whatever, hugging my pregnant belly. Not far off the Pit Boss was slouched against the rough stone wall, groaning in satisfaction. He’d dropped my leash after filling me with cum, but at the moment I couldn’t even think about grabbing it or making a getaway. The submissive desires that had left my mind numb were receding slowly, not to mention I was still reeling from an explosive orgasm. 

I pushed up into a seated position, looking down at my skinny, feminine arms and feeling the heavy sway of breasts on my chest. Sitting back on the padding of my full, round butt, I settled my bulging stomach between a pair of curvy hips and crossed my long, slender legs. I could feel the Zauknoid larva starting to squirm inside. It was a bit unsettling, but I couldn’t deny a growing sense of affection for the little worm. More evidence of the game flooding my mind with female hormones and emotions. I didn’t, or shouldn’t have any mothering instincts, so it couldn’t be any kind of natural reaction, mentally I was still a man...wasn’t I? 

Suddenly, the Pit Boss lurched into motion. I looked up in surprise to see him jerking awkwardly and kicking his feet. As I watched, I realized it looked like his entire body was glitching the same way his face had been the past couple days. When he writhed to standing position, I forced myself to do the same. My boobs felt heavy, and my bulging stomach swayed uncomfortably, forcing me to use the wall for support.

Once on his feet, the Pit Boss seemed to freeze in place. His limbs were twisted awkwardly, sticking out in unnatural directions like there was something wrong with his animation sequences. His green oval head swiveled towards me, the expression frozen in a glitchy twist.

“It-it-it’zzzz You!” his twisted mouth flapped unnaturally. “The code...c-code prompt.”

Suddenly my mind flashed back to the end of my boss battle with Gnash One-eye. Captain Korvas had appeared on a giant screen, glitched out, and said something very similar!

“Who are you?” I asked quickly. “What is this?”

“Not much-much time!” he replied. “The virus-ware will debug me quickly...”

“Wait, what virus?”

“Pro-pro-progrrram corrupted...code prompt must reach fi-fi-final **BZZZZZT!!!**” He trailed off into a deafening buzz that seemed to come, not from his malformed mouth but all around.

“Are you calling me the ‘code prompt’?” I asked, not sure if he could still answer. “And before you, er, the Pit Boss or whoever kept saying there’s something special about me...”

**BZZZZTT!!!** Another loud buzz shook through the tunnel.

“Special-special-special...” it looped robotically. “Programs can read dev-dev-deviation in code...”

“So there is a deviation in my code,” I gasped, taking a step towards him. “Is that the corrupted file on my character profile?”

“Yezz...Co-Co-Code prompt,” he buzzed. 

“What’s that mean, what code prompt?”

“Muzzt-must reach fi-fi-final stage to activate ant-ant-anti-**BZZZZRRT!!**” He stumbled back, glitching again and hit the wall with a shudder. 

There was a loud clear BING and a glowing orange progress bar appeared in front of him that said REBOOTING... He seemed to force one arm to reach toward me, holding out a twitchy finger.

“Quick-quick-quick!” he blurted. “The lo-lo-lock!”

I took another step forward, somewhat unsure but having the undeniable urge that I should listen. He also took a step towards me, reaching for my neck. I hesitated, what even was this? Before I could make up my mind, he lurched forward and poked the padlock on my collar. To my astonishment I heard and felt the lock click open, then the chain-link collar fell off my neck!

I stumbled back in shock, reaching up to touch my naked throat.

“Must escape!” the glitch asserted. “Reach final sta-sta-sta- **BZZZZRRT!**”

He froze as the progress bar reached 50%. His limbs and face started flickering back into their normal shape.

Somewhat in shock, I opened my HUD. Unfortunately, everything was still the same. None of my skills had unlocked, and my status still read: BREEDER. 

What was it Eyla and Crowther had said? They had to get Eyla out of the Breeding Pits before her status reset.

At least I was free of the leash, now nothing could stop me from running. I turned and started down the tunnel. Feeling a sudden lurch of my pregnant stomach, I paused clutching it. Okay, maybe I wouldn’t exactly be running. 

Looking down the tunnel, which was only dimly lit by the iridescent moss clinging to the walls, a nervous twinge crawled up my spine. I remembered the skittering in the shadows and the confusing twists and turns we’d come through. I had no idea how to get back! No idea what those skittering monsters would do to my slow moving pregnant self. And speaking of; no idea what would happen when I had to give birth. A wave of insecurity washed over me, and I felt tears brimming...man, I hated being such a crier in this body.

Glancing at the Pit Boss and seeing his reboot percentage reaching the 90’s, an idea popped into my mind. I hurried forward, scooping up the leash and collar. He looked back to normal but hadn’t unfrozen yet. I reached out tentatively, made sure I could still touch him, then quickly wrapped the collar around what passed for his neck and clicked the lock into place!

Holding the end of the leash, I then stepped back as far as I could, and waited. 

The progress bar reached 100% then flashed and flickered out. The Pit Boss glanced around, looking slightly confused before fixing those grey oval eyes on me.

“What happened, BREEDER?” he took a step towards me, then noticed the swing of the leash. “What is the meaning of this?” He grabbed at the collar around his neck.

“Hands off!” I snapped with a slight tug.

The Pit Boss’s hands dropped to his sides immediately. I couldn’t repress a grin as anger flared across his inhuman face and he looked at me.

“What happened? How are you doing this?”

“Nevermind all that,” I replied quickly. “You know the way out of here don’t you?”

“We are in the Labyrinth...?” It was part question and part statement. He looked around as if acclimating himself.

“Yes! Where you brought us,” I said. “Do you remember that?” He’d been glitchy for a few days, I couldn’t be sure if the program had rebooted him back to before any of that had happened?

“Yes,” his angry glare flashed back at me. “Mostly...the past few days seem a bit...”

“Choppy?” I offered when he trailed off.

He nodded. 

“Yeah, I know the feeling,” I sighed and then gave the leash a little tug. “Get dressed, now you are going to lead us out of here!”

He grimaced, sort of gritting his pointed teeth and glared down at the leash. I think he was trying to resist, but then he bent down and started pulling on his coveralls. 

“This way...” he hissed, turning to start down the tunnel. 

I could see and knew what he was going through, that desire to resist being overwhelmed by the forced obedience of the collar and leash. I took silent enjoyment in that small revenge. I followed cautiously, keeping the leash basically at full length between us. 

“How did you get that leash off, BREEDER?” he asked a short time later.

“Doesn’t matter, just keep moving.”

He grumbled but kept stomping along ahead of me. We hadn’t gone far when a sudden wave of agony spiraled through my stomach, then down into my hips (PN: 1). I groaned in surprise and pain, doubling over and clutching my bulging stomach. Inside I felt the larval ZAUK lurch, then a warm rush of liquid spilled down my inner thighs. 

“Shit!” I gasped as the pain passed. In my periphery the PREG notification was starting to pulse brighter.

The Pit Boss stopped, turning back towards me. “Ah ha! It is time!”

“Time for what?” I grunted...although I knew the answer.

“Time for you to become a mother of ZAUKS!” he declared, that needle-toothed grin spreading across his face. “Remove this collar so I can-”

“Not fucken likely,” I groaned. “I can walk, keep us moving.” I lashed the leash like reigns on a horse. He snarled at me but turned and kept moving.

I followed after, my body now feeling tense and heavy. We made it several yards before another wave of pain coiled around my stomach (PN: 2). I had to pause again.

The Pit Boss turned back to me. “We should stop until-”

“No, we shouldn’t,” I spit through grit teeth. “I need you to get me out of this maze!”

He scowled but turned and led on. We didn’t get far before I had to stop for another contraction (PN: 3). This one was so intense, it left me gasping for breath afterwards. I pushed us on a little further, when the next one gripped me. This time I couldn’t keep from crying out (PN: 4). The pain felt as if I was going to explode, or implode, or possibly just tear right in half. 

I’ve always been told women had a higher tolerance for pain than men, but apparently that perk didn’t come with my female body. This was nearly unbearable! 

We kept moving a bit further, but when the next contraction came, I knew we would have to stop. I stumbled, having to lean against the wall and whimpering in pain as a crushing pressure constricted around my hips and stomach (PN:5). They were coming quicker and getting more painful. I could see the writing on the wall.

“Alright, shit,” I groaned. “What do you know about this whole birthing process?”

The Pit Boss grinned. “Remove the leash and...”

“Oh fuck ooohhhhFF-” my voice pealed out into a screech as I was seized by another contraction (PN: 6).

I slumped against the wall, then sank to the floor. I was gasping for breath. It felt like everything had shifted downward. My stomach was churning. My hips were aching. I could feel the larva wiggling around inside, it seemed to be moving more deliberately now. 

I tried desperately to remember any conversation I’d ever had with the women I knew IRL about giving birth. Then any scenes from movies I could think of. I knew Lamaze was some kind of breathing method but not much more than that.

“We should probably get moving,” the Pit Boss said. “I’ve got to lead you out-”

I screamed as another contraction coiled around me and wrenched the leash so hard he stumbled and fell backwards (PN: 7). I gathered up the leash, reeling him towards me and glaring into his lifeless grey eyes.

“I’m not letting go of this leash,” I snarled. “Which means you have to do what I say and I’m saying help me goddam give birth!”

“Of course,” he replied, grinning and taking up position at my feet.

I cried out again as pain shot through me (PN: 8). It was getting harder to think with each contraction, so I wrapped the leash around my hand to make sure I wouldn’t accidently drop it.

“Spread your legs and lay back,” the Pit Boss instructed.

I did as he said, laying back against the wall and opening my legs as much as I could. All the pressure building through my abdomen gathered between my hips. The squirmy larva inside me seemed to move down as well, almost as if it were looking for the way out.

“Of course, normally the nursery ZAUKs are here to handle this part,” the Pit Boss said. “But I believe it’s time to push.”

I suddenly wished I’d paid more attention when I’d been there for Eyla’s birth. I took solace in remembering at least how quick it had been. So when I felt the next contraction beginning I leaned into it. The pain intensified so sharply I cried out and my head spun (PN: 10). The moment passed but left me gasping for breath.

The PREG notification was now flashing red. Watching my PAIN meter climb I remembered Eyla saying that it maxed out her PAIN points. This was still part of the game, right? Guess I had figured out how to play.

As I began to feel the next contraction, I braced myself and began to push! The pain flared right away, an unbearable pressure building between my hips (PN: 11-12-13). 

“Shit!”

“Doing well, BREEDER,” the Pit Boss encouraged from between my legs.

“Fuck. You.”

The next contraction began and I pushed again. I could sense myself opening in response to the pressure. Everything pushing downward until it felt like I was going to burst. Sweat beaded across my forehead and tears spilled down my cheeks (PN: 14-15-16).

“Almost there...”

I was in too much pain to even cuss at him this time. I knew if I could hold the pressure just a bit longer, this would all be over... I sucked in a deep breath feeling the contraction begin. I screamed, pushing with everything I had (PN: 17). My hands clawed the dirt, my heels dug in, and I clenched my teeth against the agony (PN: 18). The larval ZAUK moved further down, wiggling toward my opening. I felt my hips spreading, the pressure becoming so intense I was certain they were going split apart (PN: 19). Something thick and slimy began to ooze through my labia as his head pressed from the inside out. I threw my head back, crying out as searing pain ripped through me and I felt my vagina forced open, stretching around its big slimy head (PN: 20)!

The Pit Boss reached in and pulled. My entire body shuddered as every inch of its squirming body slithered out of my pussy. A sudden wave of relief was almost immediate, a complete release, and I slumped onto the floor, gasping for breath. 

Big red letters appeared in the air before me: YOU HAVE GIVEN BIRTH TO A ZAUK!!  Finally that PREG notification faded.  PAIN MAXED OUT! flashed before my eyes. STAMINA REDUCED: 1. INTELLIGENCE REDUCED: 1. I was already exhausted, and now that fog descended over my brain, making it difficult to think. 

“Congratulation, BREEDER,” the Pit Boss said. 

I propped up onto my elbows. He was still kneeling between my legs, now clutching a squirming, green larval Zauknoid. It had the big oval head, and writhing tadpole like body. It seemed to turn towards me, blinking with big pink eyes. I wasn’t quite sure how to feel about it, so I laid back with a groan, waiting for my head to clear.

“You must feel incredibly satisfied,” he went on. “Surely this one will grow into a strong ALPHA...” He launched into one those diatribes about my purpose and place as a BREEDER, fortunately I was too spent to really pay attention.

Eventually he’d trailed off, and I got a few minutes of silence to regather my wits. I squeezed the leash in my hand to make sure it was still there. Then with my head beginning to clear, I rolled over and scooted back to the wall. The Pit Boss was standing somewhat idly, holding my baby-I mean, the larval ZAUK. 

“So what happens to the little worm now?” I asked, running a hand through my damp, green hair.

He glanced over at me. “Your child needs to be taken to the nursey caves so they can feed him.”

My child... It sounded so natural, but this was all too surreal. I had to admit that looking at the slimy little tadpole, knowing it had grown inside me, that my body had nurtured it, stirred some confusing feelings. It was almost cute and I felt a subtly possessive urge...I shook my head, and reminded myself it was just a program, just part of the game.

“Well, unfortunately the little guy’s gonna have to wait,” I said, getting to my feet. It was an almost unexpectedly huge relief to have my body back to normal. Without the huge bulging stomach, I stood easily and felt as nimble as I had before the pregnancy. “You’re gonna lead me out of this place first!”

“But the baby-” the Pit Boss started to protest but I gave the leash a little shake.

“Nuh uh! Quickest way out, now!”

His big grey eyes narrowed, gritting his needle-like teeth as he nodded. “Quickest way out then.”

I let out a little more length to the leash as he turned and headed into the tunnel. The dim light cast by the iridescent moss seemed less creepy now, and I barely noticed the skittering at the shadowy edges. I was mostly distracted by the relief in every step now that my pregnancy had ended. I felt lighter on my feet once again, walking normally. 

I did however begin to notice that we hadn’t taken an actual turn for a while. Looking around I realized the tunnel was carved with more of a gradual, but continuous curve to it. Getting the very distinct sense and feeling that we were going deeper into the labyrinth, I began to wonder if the Pit Boss had somehow overcome the control of my leash.

“Where are we?”

“Almost there.”

“Almost where? It really seems like we’re going deeper in.”

The Pit Boss glanced back, and I could see the smirk on his green face. “Yes, we are.”

I yanked on the leash, jerking him to a stop. “I thought you were leading me out? I told you-”

“You said the quickest way out,” he cut me off. “The quickest exit is located at the center of the labyrinth.”

I huffed. Of course that could only make sense in video game logic. “How much further?”

“It’s just ahead now,” he replied continuing forward.

True to his word it was a short distance when we rounded a final bend and reached a pair of rusted metal gates. Just beyond I could see the tunnel opened into a much larger chamber. The air before me lit up in big red letters:  YOU HAVE DISCOVERED THE ZAUKNOTAUR’S LAIR!

“What the fuck is this?” I huffed again, crossing my arms in frustration. How could I not have realized that video game logic also dictated some kind of a boss battle. 

“This is what you asked for,” he replied. “All you must do is satisfy the ZAUKNOTAUR’s lust and he will allow you to use his secret escape tunnel.”

“You tricked me,” I pouted. “And just what the hell is a ZAUKNOTAUR?”

“Why he is the master of this labyrinth, of course.”

“Of course,” I sighed, walking to the rusted metal gates. They weren’t locked. Looking into the arena I could see that the walls and ceiling were domed. That iridescent moss covered almost every inch, making that room much brighter than the tunnels we’d taken to get here. I glanced back at the smug expression the Pit Boss was giving me. Then I looked down at the leash in my hand. 

“Maybe I should make you satisfy his lust...”

“You could,” His smirk only widened. “But the beast will only allow those who have sated him to pass through the secret tunnel.”

“Of course...and what happens if I lose?”

“Those who cannot sate his lust, will sate his hunger.”

“Fucken great,” I sighed. “And I suppose you think once I’m distracted by this thing, you’ll scurry off back the pits?”

“The little one does need his milk.”

I scowled and shoved the gates open, yanking the Pit Boss in behind me. He began to protest but couldn’t resist. I quickly pulled the gates closed and used the leash to tie them shut.

“What do you think you’re doing?” he snarled.

“I know you wanted me and probably still do,” I said stepping back from the ugliest, most convoluted knot I could manage. “So much so it made you bug out and alter your programing.” I stepped in close, running my hand up his arm. “You may have tricked me, but you know what if I have to fuck this thing to escape, I’m gonna make you watch me do it!”
