 Master the Tempest is Raging

Chapter 6

The Universe

The way humans perceive the universe is dependent upon their senses. Before Galileo, the idea that planets circled the sun was unimaginable and the concept of galaxies was blasphemy.

The nest and the swarm were limited in the same way. Neither had the ability to sense light the way man does. They could only absorb individual photons and then try to collate the myriad pieces of data into a coherent picture. The result was that they had an amazing level awareness of their immediate environment, but the further away they tried to see, the less coherent the picture was.

In summary, they knew the universe of atoms and molecules as well as humans knew the universe of stars and galaxies, and visa versa.
