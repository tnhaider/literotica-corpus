 For those who either never took, or saw little value in Geography, Australia is in the Southern Hemisphere - the Antipodes - (i.e. is on the opposite side of the globe to; Canada, Europe, USA, etc.) - and so its seasons are the opposite of those in the Northern Hemisphere. Thus, Christmas falls not in winter, but in summer, and it's hot - in the outback of far north-western New South Wales, very, very hot.
