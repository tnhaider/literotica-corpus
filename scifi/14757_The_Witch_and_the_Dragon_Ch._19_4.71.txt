 Sorry it took so long to post this chapter. It's kind of hard to try to post something every week, but I will definitely try to work on posting at least every two weeks. The story is coming down to the ending, perhaps four or five chapters more and then I definitely need a break before I start Ashriel and Annie's story. Thanks once more to everyone who's voted and commented. I especially appreciate the comments. They let me see what my readers want and I try to please as much as I can, of course, I the end, the characters always do what they need to do... what they must do... love without boundaries.
