 Is Willing-Slave an Oxymoron?

Chapter 8

Report from the Nest

Gamete A5CD2 worked tirelessly, taking signals from its mitochondria, processing them and sending them on with its Nucleolus. Although it wasn't capable of forming nest thoughts independently, it was aware of them. The nest had known for cycles that the central processor was approaching a crisis. All the gametes were working hard in hopes of forestalling the possibility that the carrier might be lost.

For 10,000 cycles, the nest had received inputs of information that was in direct contradiction to the instinctive memory programmed into the long chain antennas that all of the gametes depended on for the instructions they used to process the signals. They had tried hundreds of times to send a message to the central processor to fix the false input, but had never succeeded.

Just a few cycles ago, the nest had detected a signal from outside. There was help available if they could just prepare the central processor to accept it. As soon as the CP closed the data channels to begin processing the contents of the input registers, A5CD2 sent the signal to all the gametes to broadcast a virtual memory.

Even though the central processor had been programmed to ignore some of the input it had received over the last 2,000 cycles, the gametes pushed the input message into the virtual reality they were broadcasting. Thus, the message circumvented the orders to ignore it. Then they tied the input message to the image of the external help that they'd detected and using the image, they commanded the carrier to accept input only from the external help. There was no guarantee that it would get through, but it was almost their last hope.
