 This is a work of fiction. The characters and events in this story are not real, although some of the characters have been loosely patterned after people I know or know of.

I've chosen to list this story in the Sci-Fi/Fantasy category since that's where it seems to fit best to me. The reasons for this will become more apparent in later chapters. There will be a substantial amount of BDSM in the story however; just a friendly warning, in case that's not your thing.

I want to thank a former submissive of mine (who wishes to remain anonymous) for her contributions to writing this story. Her insights and feedback have been invaluable to me as is her continued friendship.

A good portion of the dialog of this series was originally written as a role-play between my friend and me, thus the back and forth narrative nature and dual points of view of many parts of the story.

I apologize for the long delay between this chapter and the last. Unfortunately, real life issues interfere at times.
