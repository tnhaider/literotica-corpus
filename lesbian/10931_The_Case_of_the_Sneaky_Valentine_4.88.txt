 Welcome, dear reader, to my entry for the 2015 Valentine's Day Story Contest.

By way of a warning, I have to say that this is a long story - the competition rules do not permit splitting it into multiple parts, so please forgive me and I hope you find it worth reading all the way to the end. I would add that there is a long build up before any sex, so please be patient.

As this is a Contest entry, please take the trouble to cast your vote at the end. Feedback is also always very welcome.

My thanks to Winterreisser for his diligent editing, encouragement and support and to Kat in her role as "Romance and Hotness Consultant"

Thanks also to the Anonymous improver of my Spanish (who provided 'La Gata' in place of 'El Gato') and to Andie's inner editor for a very insightful suggestion that I have incorporated.

I hope you enjoy the story.
