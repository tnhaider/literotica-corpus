 Ali and I were working long hours on our individual art pieces; she, touching up a few of the pen and ink series, and me, mounting and choosing the photo-art that I'd want to display for the Gallery's opening in a few weeks.

To make sure that we'd have a good turn-out and review, she worked her contacts within the art community of New Orleans, getting three of the better known unknowns to also display their work at our opening. 

All in all, it was coming together as planned with few hiccups in the process.
