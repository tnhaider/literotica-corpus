 "You have got to be fucking kidding me," Amelia spat as she glared at the two naked girls who were modestly covering themselves.

"What? What's the big deal?" Estelle retorted with attitude.

"How could you two just go behind my back like this?"

Sophia was still drowsy from just waking up, but she knew that nothing she could say would help matters. She dared not look Amelia in the eye. Instead, she just hung her head and stared at the pattern on the bedspread and listened helplessly as her two lovers fought.

"It was your idea!" Estelle growled, her anger quickly growing, "I thought we were going to try to make this work."

"Yeah; WE, not YOU. And it was my idea for you two to spend more time together."

"Well, what do you think we've been doing?"

"Not. Fucking. Funny. Sophia, I think you need to leave."

Sophia didn't need to be told twice. She quickly swung her feet over the bed, grabbed her clothes and ran to the bathroom to get dressed. She was torn between confusion, resentment and shame. How could this have happened? They were so close...so intimate, just the other night. She had to agree that she didn't see how she and Estelle were crossing the line after an encounter like that. But then what the hell did she know? She'd never been in a three-way relationship before.

Although she didn't want to look into it, the presence of the mirror was just too distracting. Sophia finished buttoning her pants and slowly lifted her head so that she could see her reflection. It looked so different than she remembered. Her eyes lacked the warmth and familiarity that made her radiate with innocence. They glistened with the wetness of tears waiting to spill, but Sophia forced herself to be stronger than that. She looked away.

On her way out the door, she stopped in the living room as she saw Amelia's present waiting for her on the counter. She could hear the two arguing loudly in the bedroom as she silently debated whether she should take the bag or not. She decided that leaving it might make Amelia even angrier, so she picked it up and left.

Trevor entered the bedroom to find Kaylin sitting at the computer, rocking out to some heavy metal. She turned around to face him and smiled wickedly. 

"What's with the 'canary that turned around and beat the shit out of the cat' look?" Trevor inquired.

"Oh, let's just say that fortunate circumstances allowed me to...shall we say, amend our plan," Kaylin stated proudly, adding off of Trevor's confused look, "I tattled on a couple of naughty girls. I may have embellished a bit, but it got the point across. Those bitches will be broken up before you even come tonight."

"Kaylin..." Trevor's began with a voice of disappointment.

"What? I thought this is what you wanted."

"Yeah. Well, I did. But this is a pretty harsh punishment for one mistake. I don't think it's a good idea to dwell on it anymore is all."

Kaylin's face showed that she was not pleased with his comments, but she quickly covered it up with a fake smile. Her arm stretched out to him, and he obediently came over to her. As he approached her, she wrapped her arm around his waist and looked up at him. This was a subtle, but effective method she used to make him feel that he was the dominant one in their relationship.

"Baby, you know I'm only doing this for you. It wasn't just her; it was all of them. They humiliated you."

"I just don't feel the need for vengeance."

"Of course you don't. You have a big heart, but if you don't stand up for yourself people will keep doing these kinds of things to you. This is about more than just them fucking you over. It's about not letting yourself get fucked over." Kaylin began to caress his back with her fingernails as she continued, "you've got so much potential that others don't see. To be honest, it's what I find so attractive about you."

"Yeah?" Trevor responded softly as he gradually succumbed to Kaylin's gentle touch.

"Absolutely; and the fact that you don't see it makes you even sexier."

Kaylin's other hand began fondling Trevor's cock through his pants, a move which resulted in him losing the will to argue. Instead, he leaned his head down to Kaylin's and pressed his lips against hers. She responded by grabbing his head and kissing him back passionately. Her fingers slowly unzipped his pants, causing his bulge to push the underwear out. Kaylin took this opportunity to lean in and lightly clamp her teeth around his hardness, sucking it through his clothes. Trevor responded with a variety of guttural noises.

"See," Kaylin said as she took a moment to look up into Trevor's eyes again, "I wouldn't do this to just anyone. And I wouldn't let just anyone fuck me."

Trevor could only nod in agreement, closing his eyes and panting as she brought her mouth back to his cock.

Sophia sat on her bed with her back to the wall. There was no depressing music playing, the lights were not turned off, and not a tear rolled down her cheek. She held the bag that held Amelia's present in her hands, turning it over and over absent-mindedly as she pondered what had just happened. Her mind simultaneously considered what would happen in the future. Were they broken up? Would Estelle be able to talk some sense into her jealous girlfriend? Would they get back together under certain conditions, or would they try to remain 'just friends'? What if Amelia never wanted to see her again?

The feeling seem to come back in her fingers as she accidentally let the back slip onto the bed. Sophia wondered whether she should open it under such chaotic circumstances. It certainly would not mean what Amelia had originally intended it to mean, whatever it was. Still, Sophia was beginning to get curious, After all, it was unlike Amelia to show any kind of romantic gesture such as a gift.

Sophia picked up the bag and was about to open it when she heard a knock at her bedroom door.

"What?" she said barely above a whisper, for she hadn't spoken all morning and her voice was hoarse.

The door opened softly and Raquel stepped inside the room. "Can we talk?" she asked somberly.

"Now's really not a good time," Sophia responded without turning her head to look at her.

"Well, there never seems to be a good time anymore. Not since you've started hanging out with that girl Amelia."

Sophia raised her head sharply at the mention of that name. She immediately knew that she'd betrayed herself, for Raquel reacted to this by hardening her face.

"Oh, that got your attention, did it? Well here's something else that might pique your interest. Trevor stopped by today."

Sophia didn't say anything, but looked away shamefully, for she knew that she was trapped. There was no possible way for her to avoid this discussion, the discussion that she'd been dreading to have.

"Sophie, why didn't you tell me you two broke up?" Raquel's voice sounded more hurt than angry.

"Because we just broke up!" Sophia said to emphasize how difficult of a time in her life this was, "It's not something I really want to brag about."

"Brag? Who's asking you to...you know, this is exactly what I'm talking about. You never talk to me anymore, you're never around. We used to tell each other everything. Now you act like a god damned moody teenager!"

Sophia's eyes widened as she realized how much trouble she was in, as she had never heard her roommate swear before. That struck such an emotional chord in her that she could hold it in no longer; Sophia buried her head in her knees and burst into tears. She didn't see Raquel's face soften at seeing her friend cry, nor did she notice that she had made her way over to the bed and was now standing in front of her.

"I'm sorry Sophie, I didn't mean to yell," Raquel said with a gentle voice, "I just miss you."

Sophia raised her head and looked up with a bitter expression on her face, tears still flowing from her eyes. She stared at Raquel In disbelief.

"So this is about you?"

"No, I –"

"I'm SORRY," Sophia's voiced raised, "if my pain inconveniences you."

Raquel sighed and shook her head, realizing that anything she could say might be taken the wrong way. Defeated, she turned around to leave without another word. Sophia's eyes burned into Raquel's back as she walked out of the room without looking back. She silently cursed herself for not having enough control to keep herself from crying, and quickly wiped the tears from her cheek.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

Kaylin: So she just told you to get out and that was that?

Sophia: Yeah, and I haven't heard anything else from her in two days.

Kaylin: Well that sucks. I don't see what you did wrong...

Sophia raised her hands emphatically and mouthed the words "thank you" to the laptop screen after reading that last message. She took a sip from her caramel latte and thought of what to say next. The past couple of days had proved to be a period of extremes. On the one hand, she had never felt such emotional turmoil between the neglect of Amelia and the silent remorse from Raquel. On the other hand, Kaylin had become like a beacon of light in these dark times. They had developed an amazing friendship in such a short time and were now emailing each other several times a day. In fact, they had gotten so close that Sophia actually felt comfortable confiding her recent romantic dilemma to her.

Sophia: Thank you. I still feel guilty about it. I mean, I broke Amelia's trust.

Kaylin: Did Amelia tell you or Estelle that you two couldn't have sex?

Sophia: No.

Kaylin: Then how were you supposed to know? You girls had already crossed that line. If she wanted to impose additional rules (that in my opinion would take your relationship back a step anyway), then she should have been clear about it from the start. You have nothing to feel guilty for.

Sophia: ...you know, you're right. I'm so glad I talked to you about this.

Kaylin: Me too. Thank you for trusting me with such a personal issue. So what about the other girl...Esther?

Sophia: Estelle. She's actually been sneaking me emails here and there. She's been really nice about the whole thing, actually. She's very sweet. But we're just friends.

Sophia felt a little self conscious talking too much about Estelle to Kaylin. She found that she didn't want to reveal that she still had feelings for the girl. At first she figured it was because doing so would be painful, seeing as how she and Estelle could no longer see each other. However, she realized it was because she had a crush on Kaylin.

Kaylin: So do you still like her?

"Bloody hell!" Sophia whispered harshly to herself. Why did Kaylin have to ask the one question she was hoping wouldn't be brought up? She considered the different ways to offer a non-committed response while also wondering what in the world she was doing. Hadn't she learned her lesson with Amelia and Estelle? Shouldn't she be on some kind of relationship sabbatical? Clearly she needed a break from all the drama that comes with romantic partners. Kaylin must have noticed the hesitated response, for she sent another text.

Kaylin: It's alright; you don't have to tell me if you don't want to.

Sophia: I'm sorry. I'm just so confused!

Kaylin: Don't be sorry. I understand confusion. I remember being like that. That's why I prefer to keep my encounters short and sweet, no strings attached.

Sophia: Really? How do you do that without emotions getting in the way?

Kaylin: It was difficult at first, because I – like you – had trained myself to believe that I was supposed to strive for long-term relationships. Oh, but you have no idea the sense of liberation you feel once you let go of that mindset.

Sophia: You sound like Amelia.

Kaylin: Yes, but Amelia is a hypocrite, remember? She may spout off all these innovative theories, but unless she backs them up with her actions...they are just empty words. I live what I speak.

Sophia: What you say makes a lot of sense.

Kaylin: Thank you. Oh, I gotta go. Talk to you later?

Sophia: Wait.

Sophia didn't want their conversation to end. She wanted to meet Kaylin in person again, but didn't want to sound too desperate. She struggled over the right way to say what she was thinking without being obvious. 

Sophia: I was wondering if you'd like to go out to lunch some time?

The words sat on the screen, staring back at her as she stared at them. It was too late to take them back now. She had intended it as a friendly meeting, but she wondered if they came off as an invitation to a date. The seconds felt like minutes as Sophia waited impatiently for a response.

Kaylin: I'm kind of busy today...

Sophia's heart dropped as she read the words that popped up. It must have sounded like a proposition for a date. How could she have been so careless with the way that she phrased that question? After the 'no strings attached' speech, she'd be lucky if Kaylin ever emailed her again.

Kaylin: ...but I'm free tonight. How does dinner at my place sound to you?

Wow. First her heart dropped, then her stomach did a somersault. Her insides were very acrobatic today. She hurriedly typed in her response, misspelling about every other word, proclaiming that she would definitely make herself free to be there tonight. She was very careful to avoid the phrase 'it's a date'. As Kaylin signed off, Sophia was unable to keep a grin from spreading across her face. Even the waitress did a double-take as she passed by.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *

The sun had long since dropped down over the horizon by the time Sophia made her way to her destination. She parked her car on the curb, but hesitated before opening the door. Many thoughts raced through her head; so many that she had trouble keeping up with them. The most pressing question was whether she could become intimate with Kaylin without getting emotionally involved. After all, her track record was not favorable in that light.

The door opened and Sophia stepped out onto the black surface of the road. She pulled her black skirt down and looked at her reflection in the car window. It was difficult to see her eyes and so she didn't really feel that she was looking into herself, like with a mirror. That gave her a sense of disconnect.

As she approached the front patio, the door opened and Kaylin stood in the doorway. She was wearing only a black stretch lace corset. Somehow Sophia wasn't surprised. Kaylin shifted her head and her blonde hair fell from her shoulder and rested on the top of her breast. She smiled and moved to the side to allow room for Sophia to come in. Without a word, Sophia stepped inside.

"Thanks for inviting..." Sophia began to speak nervously, but stopped in mid sentence when Kaylin held a finger up to her mouth.

"Shh...don't talk," the blonde seductress purred as she leaned in closer.

Sophia was very aroused at Kaylin's smooth manner and took her finger into her mouth, biting it gently. Kaylin took her hand away and caressed Sophia's hair with it, letting her fingers become entangled within its strands. The fingers unhurriedly slid down her arm until they reached her hand. She willingly obeyed as her mistress led her to the dimly lit bedroom.

Kaylin stopped Sophia and turned her around so that she was facing away from her, staring at the bed. She then brushed her hair to the side and began nibbling on her neck. Her hands slipped under the lacy fabric of Sophia's bra and began fondling her nipples, causing Sophia to close her eyes to better focus on the pleasure that she longed for. One hand continued to focus on a breast, but the other one retracted from the bra and slipped under her skirt instead. Sophia re-established her footing so that she could spread her legs a little further apart. Kaylin's hand crept further inside and pressed against her panties, making them wet with Sophia's anticipation.

Both hands briefly left Sophia's skin, making her eyes open in wonder before feeling the unmistakable sensation of her skirt being pulled down. As the skirt slowly descended around Sophia's legs, she felt the warm, wet sensation of Kaylin's tongue sliding down her back at the same pace. This caused her to shiver, and she instinctively held her arms to her chest.

Kaylin's tongue traced the edge of Sophia's panties, from one end of her lower back to the other. She then brought her teeth over the waistband and gently bit down, grasping the panties firmly before using her teeth to pull them down to Sophia's ankles. Her tongue then returned to follow a trail from Sophia's ankle back up to her buttocks, where Kaylin spent a little time indulging in kisses and nibbles.

While her mouth was busy enjoying one side of Sophia's midsection, her hands reached around and explored the other. One hand reached between her thighs and slowly rose until it reached the slick folds of her secreting vagina. Kaylin easily slid two fingers inside her and smiled to herself as she heard Sophia gasp. The lower body trembled before her as Kaylin rubbed her thumb on Sophia's clitoris while continuing to push her fingers in and out of her.

Kaylin took pleasure in imagining how Sophia's face looked; eyes shut tight like she was concentrating hard or trying to remember something.

It was time for the next part of the scene. Kaylin slithered her way around Sophia's body and climbed onto the bed, careful to stay in the center. She lied on her back with her elbows propping her up, and spread her legs invitingly.

Sophia needed no instruction as she knelt obediently and dipped her head in between Kaylin's legs. For the first time in her life, she tasted another woman's vagina. She realized that this had been an important aspect of her former relationship with the girls that had never been explored. She wondered how this could have not been obvious until now.

Her tongue stretched out to welcome the initiation. She licked the lower area of the fleshy opening, to taste the juices that had already trickled from the depths of Kaylin's passion. The bittersweet aroma filled her nostrils as she did this, intoxicating her primal instincts. Sophia was overcome with lust and pressed her mouth up against the mound firmly, thrusting her tongue into her new lover's canal. She barely noticed the moans of delight above her as she enveloped her entire awareness in Kaylin's sex. Sophia felt as though a great hunger had awoken inside her and ached to be fed. She began to make noises herself as she pushed her mouth up even harder, unable to satisfy the lust that now fully controlled her.

Sophia wrapped both arms around either of Kaylin's legs and brought her hands to the top of her mound. She used her fingers to open the folds of Kaylin's flower even wider so that she could devour more of her. Kaylin's pleasure noises were growing rapidly louder as she squirmed and arched her back. She begged Sophia not to stop, although it was obvious she had no intention to.

In the midst of her ecstasy, Kaylin snuck a glance at the dresser against the wall, to the side of them. She winked at the red light that peeked out at her from behind a video camera lens.
