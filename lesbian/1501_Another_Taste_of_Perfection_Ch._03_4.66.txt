 I hear O singing in the kitchen and smell bacon and coffee before I open my eyes.

OH GOD.

I can hear my heart pounding in my ears when I realize that Lana is still naked in my bed. Draped over me. And my room smells like sex.

Fuck. Fuck. Fuck.

I lift her arm off of me and put on a t-shirt and some perfume. I walk out and quietly close the door then pad into the kitchen, "Morning," I pour a cup of coffee.

O pulls the bacon out of the oven, "Good morning. Would your guest like some breakfast?" she smirks.

"Hm?"

"Oh, please. Two bottles of wine. Did you drink those yourself? And that's not your coat on that chair." She waves the spatula at me, quite proud of her sleuthing.

Before I can answer her, Lana emerges from my bedroom, sex hair all over the place, my STYX t-shirt and some of my shorts. She looks adorable.

"Morning," she kisses my cheek and reaches for a coffee mug.

"Hey!" O shouts.

All the color has drained out of my face and I feel like I might faint.

"Aren't you the chick from the club the other night?" O asks, still gesticulating with the spatula.

"Lana," she smiles that sexy, mischievous smile.

"Right! Lana. Do you like bacon? Cause I made a shit-ton."

I'm frozen in time. Both of them turn to me, "Oh my god, Elle! Are you feeling alright?" O runs over and puts her hands on my shoulders. She blinks up at me and I can hear her talking, but I can't manage to say anything.

"Elle," Lana puts her hand on my cheek, "You look like you've just seen a ghost."

Finally I say, "We were just watching movies all night."

They look perplexed.

"That's why Lana's still here," I go on, now unable to  stop  speaking, "She came over so we could watch movies and we fell asleep."

O raises an eyebrow, "Elle, did you also color in coloring books and bake cookies?"

"Huh?"

Lana looks nonplussed, "We were going to go out to dinner but we stayed here and fucked a bunch."

"Now  that  believe," O turns back to the eggs on the stove.

"Lana!"

She puts a hand on her hip, "It's not like you're a kid telling your mom what we did. You're a grown woman."

"Do you guys want toast?" O grabs a loaf of bread from the breadbox.

"I'm sorry, I just didn't want to make this weird." I say, sheepishly.

"Well, you're the only person here who is making it weird at this time," O slides a plate toward me.

I pick up a piece of bacon, "Okay then. How was your night?"

"Meh. Richard took me to the Slurping Turtle. Which was awesome, but too crowded. He wanted me to go back to his place, but I just wasn't feeling it."

"Who's Richard?" Lana sips her coffee.

"This guy I've been seeing on and off. He's alright. But he's just alright. Ya know?"

I am completely in awe. This is normal breakfast. On a normal morning. Lana is in my kitchen enjoying breakfast with me and my best friend. I must be dreaming.

O finishes her eggs, "Welp, you two  looooove birds  have fun. I took Martin's opening shift so that I could have tonight off. I might just go out dancin'," she puts her plate in the sink and heads to the bathroom, "You guys should come," she stops and turns around, "Oh wait, you already did! Ha!" She slams the bathroom door behind her.

"She's really just so special," I blush.

"She seems like a great friend," Lana smiles back at me, "Listen, I don't want to wear out my welcome. Maybe I'd better go."

"No!"  too desperate  "Uh, no, no. Stay. If you don't have any plans, I mean. We could hang out. Watch movies. I dunno."  Bravo 

Her eyes light up at the idea and she takes another bite of bacon.

*************************************************

Several hours later it's raining buckets. I've learned a few things about Lana. Her parents died when she was very young and left her everything. And everything is an insane amount of things. She didn't tell me how much, but they were incredibly comfortable financially.

Instead of working, she's invested money all her life and does a ton of charity work.

She loves horror movies, dirty martinis, and the color green. So I've put on a green dress. We're working our way through the Halloween franchise and drinking dirty martinis.

Lana cozies up to me, "Do you have a sweatshirt I could borrow? I'm freezing."

"I have a whole drawer full. Go pick one out. Middle dresser drawer."

 Uh oh 

Before I'm even on my feet, Lana is standing in the doorway, waving my strap-on at me, "I'm suddenly not cold anymore. I'm pretty hot, actually."

"I've never even used it. I swear. I've only... fantasized about it,"

She places the base of it against her pelvis and saunters over to me, pushing it against me, "I think that needs to change right now," she reaches up and kisses me, then takes my hand and guides me to my room.

Lana closes the door and promptly pushes me up against it, her fingers quickly working the buttons on my dress. Her mouth has claimed mine and that warmth rises up within me. She pushes my sleeves off of my shoulders and finds a pointy, pink nipple with her teeth. She's careful not to bite too hard. "Harder," my voice is almost unrecognizable.

Her teeth clamp down and my initial shock is met by a wave of pleasure. She yanks gently at the hem of my dress and it crumples to the floor. She drops to her knees and makes a neat circle with her lips over the fabric of my panties. I feel like I could crumple to the floor with my dress. My knees are shaking, but I don't dare tell her to stop.

In a flash, she's back on her feet. She pushes me onto the bed and crawls on top of me. She's lapping at the cotton between my thighs like a hungry beast. Like she can't get enough of my taste.

Again, instead of pulling my underwear down, she rips through the elastic band and discards them. She latches onto me, taking in every last bit of my arousal. Her tongue is like nothing I've ever felt and she works it masterfully around my clit and down to my opening. She's sucking me in over and over again and everytime I come a little closer to the brink. Just listening to her slurping sounds and the moans that drift up my way is enough to drive me crazy.

My hands are in fists, gripping my pillows. I feel like I'm about to burst when I hear O come in the front door. I prop myself up on my elbows and tell Lana to stop, but she doesn't, "Not until you cum," she mumbles against my wet flesh, "and then I'm going to fuck you," she adds.

I can hear O calling out. I think she eventually puts two and two together and I hear the TV go louder. Lana sees this as a green light to take liberties with the noise level and hums against me while she sucks faster, harder.

A sound is stuck in the back of my throat and I'm terrified to let it out. Then, as though someone's flipped a switch, I'm being overcome with a rippling orgasm that hijacks my entire body. My voice fills the room. I slap my hand over my mouth. Lana doesn't stop.

She's got her face buried in me and slowly starts backing off. She sucks my clit into her mouth and then pulls her head away, making loud suckling noises.

She stands up and drops her shorts. She throws her t-shirt across the room and quickly secures the strap-on around her hips. I'm preparing myself for her. She's got this carnal desire thing going on and I'm reaping the benefits.

She's on top of me again, propped up to one side, teasing me with the tip of the large rubber toy. Part of it goes inside her, most of it goes inside me. She pauses for a moment and cups my chin in her hand. Her lips flutter across my cheek until they find mine. She kisses me slowly. Softly. I can feel her moving the head down in line with me. My hips are begging for it. She breaks our kiss, covers my mouth with her free hand, and plunges all the way into me.

Neither one of us lasts very long. She's thrusting into me hard, keeping intense eye contact the entire time. She bites her lip hard and throws her head back, strangled gasps escaping her throat. In the midst of her orgasm, my own rumbles up inside of me and my muscles grasp the toy vigorously.

I watch her as she comes down. Her lips are bright red. Her cheeks are almost matching. Her brow is furrowed and her eyes are squeezed shut. She shakes violently a couple of times before collapsing on top of me.

*******************************************************************

When we wake up, it's dark outside. Lana's angelic, contented face is resting on my shoulder. She even sleeps pretty. I can hear O's music. Poor O. I can't imagine what she heard earlier. It becomes apparent that something delicious is cooking. I remember that I haven't checked my phone in like 24 hours and I grab it from the bedside table.

Jules called me. My throat tightens up and I decide to listen to the voicemail later. O texted me from the living room.

 I'm making gumbo tonight. Got a date comin' over around 7. Join us if you like. 

It's 5:45. Lana mumbles something and pulls the blankets up to her chin. We need to leave the apartment at some point, but secretly I hope she stays over again. There's something sort of wonderful about finding someone you can't get enough of. I know that eventually we'll tire of one another. But what if we don't? I'm doing my best not to label this. I always label everything. I want to go with the flow, so to speak, but I don't know that I've ever gone with the flow.

Lana rolls over, eyes still closed, "What smells so good?"

"O's making gumbo"

"Mmmm," she smiles.

"You're welcome to stay for dinner if you'd like. O has a date coming over, but we're invited to dinner," I'm nervous she'll say she has to go. And why shouldn't she? She's got things to do. Probably.

"We, huh?" she sits up, "I like the sound of that."

She straddles my lap and pushes my hair behind my ears, "Would you like it if I stayed for dinner, pretty girl? Cause I sure would love to."

I run my hands up the small of her back. I allow myself a moment to drink her in. She really is beautiful. Her hair is mussed in a sultry I-just-had-awesome-sex way. She's a bit of perfection. I'm trying to think of a non-desperate way to ask her to stay the night again. "Hell, you could have dinner here tonight and breakfast here tomorrow."

She kisses me and smiles, "I don't know what this is yet, but I haven't been this happy in a long time."

I'm about to check that voicemail from Jules, but this moment is so perfect, I don't want to spoil it, "Why don't we take a shower and have some gumbo?"

She looks giddy. We cross the hallway to the bathroom and O shouts from the kitchen, "Comin' up for air? I hope you haven't spoiled your appetites!" She laughs at herself and we scurry into the bathroom, giggling to ourselves.

While we're getting dressed for dinner, a thought occurs to me that I wish hadn't: when something seems too good to be true, it usually is.

"Hey," she catches me staring off into the distance.

"Hey," I smile warmly at her.

"Everything OK?" she runs her fingers down my forearm and they land, interlaced with mine.

"Everything's perfect,"  for now...
