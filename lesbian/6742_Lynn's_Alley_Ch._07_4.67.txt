 "There's my girls," Ali said when Sami and I walked into the house from the portico, beaming a smile at us. Sami and I had closed the gallery that Saturday afternoon and she grabbed a ride with me, since she had no vehicle.

Walking towards us carrying a plate with seasoned steaks, she was heading for the back patio, towards the grill. Reaching with her mouth, she gave me a sweet kiss and turning her head, did the same to Sami.

"Glad you could make it, sweetie," she said over her shoulder to Sami after she had motioned for us to follow her.

"Sami, let's get this out of the way so that we can all have a relaxing evening of fun, just us three chickadees, okay?" setting the plate on the shelf of the bricked grill cooker.

"I'm not angry with you, Sami; not with you, not with Lynn," looking at her, smiling as she talked, "I understand your attraction to her, and I understand her attraction to you, 'our' attraction to you."

"We're all adults here, and things happen between adults that sometimes the adults have little control over," she continued, putting the steaks on the hot grill, the sizzle from the meat juices producing instant hunger in me.

"Lynn and I are in love with each other but that doesn't mean we can't share a part of that with special friends; with you, the three of us, as adults, understand sweetie?"

Nodding her head in understanding, Sami quietly said, "I do, Ali, I understand and I'm glad that you're not angry with me, thank you for that."

Smiling suggestively over her shoulder at Sami as she flipped the steaks and checked the baked potatoes on the top shelf, Ali said to her, "I'll give all the opportunity to express your thanks later, baby, after we've fueled our bodies with food."

And reaching to her with her mouth, she gave Sami a long, lingering, lustful kiss as I poured a Cabernet for us to enjoy with the steaks. Smiling, I watched as they kissed, damn near over-pouring the last glass.
