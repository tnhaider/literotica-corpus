 For "Dana".

Based on a true story.

________

She avoided her husband's questioning eyes and pretended to be absorbed in the sermon, but it was difficult to follow along. The preacher's passionate ranting just could not command the same amount of attention from her as the butt plug she had jammed up her ass. 

Try as she might, she couldn't stop shifting in her seat. With every little movement, every time she crossed or uncrossed her legs, slouched forward, leaned back, and just generally rubbed her ass all over the chair, she was hyper aware of the plug's hard stem... 

Pulling... stretching... this way and that...

As her sensitive little hole puckered - and grabbed it tight.
