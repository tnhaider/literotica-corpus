 Smokey Saga #63: "The Art Of The Squeal"

*****

My first thought was to call this "Hooked II," but that would make very little sense. The characters and storyline are completely different, and besides, the Smokey Sagas past #50 are all Sapphic. Perhaps they should now be known as Sapphic Sagas. It's going under Lesbian Sex, but you'll want to know that this also involves BDSM, and sort of Non-Consent, though that's debatable. Oh, yes, and this is not a story idea suggested by someone else; we are now back to those directly from the wonderfully twisted mind of yours truly. And you know the drill, friends: feedback's welcomed, valued and appreciated.
