 "How are you feeling?" Zabi asked as she placed the glass of fruit juice on the bedside table.

"Like I'm dying." Alex replied. "Are you sure I haven't caught malaria?"

Zabina sat on the edge of the bed and tenderly felt the temprature of Alex's head. The fever had dropped off a great deal over night, and truth be told she had been a little worried about just how hot Alex had become. There had been a bout of forty eight hour flu going around and Zabi was fairly sure Alex had caught it. Although Alex was convinced she had either malaria or pneumonic plague.

As normal when she was ill, Zabi had sat up all night comforting the distressed Alex. It wasn't that Alex didn't cope well with illness, the words 'totally impossible' would be Zabi's choice.

Zabi was fairly sure Alex was far better than she was letting on and had concocted a cunning plan to get her back on her feet sooner rather than later.

"Yes I am very sure you haven't got malaria. It's a flu virus. You'll be back to your normal self in a day or so." Zabi reassured.

"Well I'm sure its malaria and I'll be lucky if I'm still alive in a day or so." Alex retorted pouting.

Zabi sighed. Alex was possibly the worst patient in the world. What she needed was an incentive to get better.

An idea formed in her mind and Zabina grinned happily. It may not get Alex back on her feet quicker, but it would be fun trying.
