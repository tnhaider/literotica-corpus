 She stood in the hall, her nails painted a pouty-pink. Her hands clutched her books, pressing them into her perky, little b-cup breasts. I had seen her a few times before, and every time I caught a glimpse of her auburn hair and deep brown eyes I found myself fascinated with her.

It wasn't like me. Not like me at all. I liked men- long, thick cocks and tight, round man-asses. Not people of my own gender, but this girl, standing in the hallway of my dorm made the tiny hairs on my arms stand straight up. The chill running across my body made its way up my stomach and to my breasts. My nipples hardened; I could feel them poking against my tight, white t-shirt.

"They call her Tasty," Ashley said in a snotty tone, following my gaze. 

"Why?" I asked, still staring.

"Not sure, but that's what I heard. She must be a slut or something to have a name like that." She snickered, pulling her eyes from Tasty and looking at me. "Are you having a lesbian moment or something?"

I didn't hear her. Tasty was talking to another girl, wiping one of the locks framing her face out of her eyes. She rubbed her ankles together, tilted her back slightly and grinned coyly.

Was she flirting with that girl?

"Earth to Sarah! Hello?"

Snapping back into reality, I smiled at Ashley, shaking my head. "How could you call her a slut? You don't even know her. Besides, you're no angel."

"Because I'm being catty. Let's get out of here. I'm starving."

Shrugging my shoulders, I followed Ashley down the hall. When I passed Tasty, I had to give her another glance. When I did, she locked eyes with me and smiled.
