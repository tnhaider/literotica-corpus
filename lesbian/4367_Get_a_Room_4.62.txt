 Author's note: This is part of a series of stories about Jacqueline DeNorlan, a famous sculptor and her submissive, a young Assistant District Attorney named Victoria Lerner. 

I want to test them out before thinking about writing more than the three stories that already exist on my hard drive. So, feel free to comment on the story, critical remark are especially welcome â€“ as long as they focused on facts and not on pure emotion. In plain words, if you think the story sucks, not only let me know that it does but also tell me why.

Thanks!
