 Vivian Thorn pulled her hand back from her work and checked her pressure gauge. It read eight hundred pounds and she nodded to herself. She returned to gently brushing sediment away from the delicate vase, half buried in the ocean floor. Underwater archeology was her passion, but she was so single minded that once she began, she would often forget to check the readouts. On many occasions she had been forced to forego her safety stop because she was almost out of gas. 

She cursed herself when it happened, because it meant she had to spend extra time on the surface and her research group was running out of time and grant money. Viv hated diving with analogue gauges, but she had hocked her dive computer and most of her back up gear for extra dollars. Even her Buoyancy Control Device, the jacket with air cells that allowed her to maintain stability under water, was borrowed. She had risked almost everything she had on this expedition.

The vase, while beautiful, was not part of the wreck she sought. It was, however, pretty valuable and if it was in pristine condition, might fetch enough money to keep her operation going one more week. The investors had already pulled out, cutting their losses and forcing her to use her own limited means. They had decided the Gulphin was just another treasure legend. 

In some ways, she was relieved. Investors were interested in profit, not history and would pressure her to bring up the reputed treasure trove of silver and gold. Without backers, she would be free to excavate it thoroughly. The ship had special meaning to her and the history was far more important than the treasure. If she could just find the damned thing!
