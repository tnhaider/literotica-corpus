 Author's note:

I do recommend you read chapter one first, as much of this will make no sense without it.

Thank you very much for the positive comments from the first chapter. 

It is not my intent or design to offend, so please be aware that this story has been written for adults of a particular kind: it is unlikely to be everyone's cup of tea. This story contains mild elements of non-consent/reluctance, forced nudity, humiliation, "first time" and lesbian interaction. If you are likely to be offended by this, please read something else.

Please also note that this story continues to be a bit of a slow-burn. If you are after more instant gratification (which we all are at some time or another), then please come back and read this another day.

If you like it, please do remember to vote. Feedback, as always, is what keeps me going; the more feedback I get the faster the next parts will be finished!

Thank you, and I hope you enjoy!
