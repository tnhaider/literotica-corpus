 Sami liked using the workout center of their apartment complex, she liked being able to run on the small oval running/walking track that surrounded the 'machine room'. Sami still ran daily, getting up early to run before work, or after they returned from work, but she ran.

Sami had tried, unsuccessfully, to get Bonnie into running but that wasn't going to happen, so Sami ran alone, lost in her thoughts as she did so…

Work had been going well, and even though they worked in different areas of the station's infrastructure, they both had tales to tell over lunch or dinner. The thing was, though, that neither talked about 'everything' that happened at work.

Sami had become friendly with another worker-bee from the station's art department, Ashley; friendly, but not 'friends', at least not yet. Ashley had asked Sami to go out for drinks, a couple of times, and when Sami finally admitted that she wasn't old enough yet to drink legally, Ashley switched the invite to drinking with her at her home.

But Sami didn't accept the invite yet, yet being the operative word; she was seriously considering it, though, Sami's own 'gaydar' having picked up some vibes from Ashley along those lines.

But no, not yet; still, it was something to think about.

Having run her usual five miles, Sami cooled down slowly, drinking a ton of water in the process, and then she jogged to their apartment; entering, she could hear Bonnie's shower running, so she chose the other bedroom's shower to quickly clean up before they left for work.

The shower was finally waking her up, as she stood under the stream of hot water, and Bonnie let her mind wander…

Bonnie never mentioned the 'hits' that had been coming her way from some of the younger, and in one case, older, guys that worked at the station. She never mentioned that she was seriously considering accepting a date with a good-looking, 'Breaking News' reporter and of course, she never mentioned that she was even considering the pros and cons of letting the young reporter, or another guy, get into her pants.

Bonnie's rationalization was as a gut check of her own sexuality; oh, she'd never stop loving women, but she wondered if there was room in her life for cock, as well. That married friend of Sami's, Jena, enjoyed both men and women in the sack, and it seemed to work out okay for her. 

Well, there was that cheating thing on her husband, but Bonnie was fairly certain that she would never do that, the cheating thing, that is. But still, if she did decide to fuck the reporter, she thought that it'd be better that she kept that to herself, and not tell Sami.
