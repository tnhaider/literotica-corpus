 Author's Note: This story is dedicated to Colleen Thomas whose work has been such an inspiration to writers on this site. I didn't know her personally, but perhaps to know a writer's work is to know her as she wished to be known. In that case, I can claim more than a passing acquaintance.

This story is not somber. I doubt she would have wanted it so. Her own work was anything but. It was playful and passionate, an unfailing celebration of life. One can only wish there had been more of it.
