"Momma, it's my life that we're talking about, not yours," Bonnie said into her cell phone; well, more like shouted, than said.

Sami was trying not to hear the conversation as she packed her bag for the upcoming road trip with the team, but in the confines of the small dorm room, that wasn't a possibility.

"Look, if Roy and I are okay with breaking off the engagement, then you and his parents and daddy, will just have to deal with it, okay? And look, momma, I've got to go, I'm going to be late for a class; I'll talk to you later, bye," and with that said, Bonnie closed her cell-phone and remained sitting in her bed, cross-legged, a bit of her panties visible between her legs under her sleep shirt which had hiked up onto her thighs.

"I'm sorry, Sami, I'm sorry you had to hear all that crap," Bonnie apologized, looking to Sami with a sort-of sad smile on her face.

"Don't worry about it, Bonnie, shit happens, you know?"

"Oh yeah, I know," Bonnie said with a bit of a sad laugh.

"Roy and I had our talk," Bonnie was saying to Sami as she rooted through her closet for class-clothes, "and you were right, I was right, Roy felt the same way I did about getting married. He felt that it was just what was supposed to be, not really what we wanted, or he wanted."

"Don't get me wrong, we still very much care for each other and all, but he felt that we were being pushed into this by our parents, just like I felt."

"I'm sorry, Bonnie," Sami said in sympathy.

"Don't be; if you hadn't help me to get the courage to talk with him about it, I'd probably made a huge mistake, both of us would've, and gotten married. I'm just really thankful that I didn't wind up pregnant, ya' know?"

Well, Sami didn't know, of course, but said that she did.

"So what's your game plan now?" Sami asked, "Plan to play the field for a while?"

"Nah, I mean, I don't know; it's really not that important at the moment; I mean it's not like I'm really going to miss the sex, ya' know or anything," laughing a bit, "I mean, it was okay, but...well, you know, right?"

"Sort of," Sami answered, zipping her overnight bag afterwards.

Slipping out of her sleep shirt, Bonnie grabbed a bra from her drawer and slipped her arms through the straps, bending forward to slip her girls into the bra, then straightening up to clasp it behind her back.

"Well, you know all of my dirty laundry," Bonnie laughingly said, "when am I going to hear the details of your love life; you never talk about your boyfriends, or dating, or anything."

Sami chuckled, picked up her bag to walk out of the door, when she stopped, her hand on the knob; "Yeah, well maybe if you get me drunk enough, I'll fill your ears with tales of my exciting sex-life one day," and wishing each other well with class and the game, Sami left to meet Toni at the coffee kiosk in the square.

Looking up from the table in the square, T saw Sami walking fast towards her, bag in hand. T walked up to the kiosk and ordered a couple of coffees for her and Sami, handing Sami hers when she set her bag down at the table.

"Mornin' Glory," T jokingly said as they sat down, "What's new with you?"

Sami filled T in on the latest in her roommate's on-going drama with her family, both of them shaking their heads sadly afterwards.

"Just another reason for me to like chicks," T joked, her voice soft so that it could only be heard by Sami.

"Yeah, but T, that can go just as bad as with a guy; you know that," Sami said, "I mean, it's about relationships and interaction; the gender doesn't matter."

"Don't I know it," T said in response, "we bitches can be real bitches when we want to be," both laughing at the truthfulness of the statement, walking off together to the team bus.
