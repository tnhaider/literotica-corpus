 "Did you have as much sand in your snatch, as I did?" Sami asked as she walked into the kitchen, toweling her hair dry, her tall, fine-looking body, as naked as the day she was born.

Damn! She looks so fucking good, naked.

She was referring to our make-out session on the beach, last night, after we returned from Lahaina.

"No, I kept my butt on the mats and towels, like I kept telling you to do, dumb-ass!" laughing as I said it.

"Yeah, well, you should have tried harder to make me understand about making out on the beach, about the 'dangers'," she said in a mock-accusatory tone of voice.

"Wouldn't have matter, girlfriend, you were so damned anxious to get your mouth on my puss," I replied, smiling at her.

She paused her hair-toweling for a moment, as if thinking about what I said, then laughing, she said, "Yeah, I guess I was, wasn't I; well, it's still your fault for having such a delicious honey-pot, bitch!"

"And I mean that in a good way, sweetie," she laughingly said, heading back to finish her hair-drying.
