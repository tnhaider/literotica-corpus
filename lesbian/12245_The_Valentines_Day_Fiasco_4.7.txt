 Snowfall in February isn't unusual in the Washington D.C. area, but this monster had already dumped six inches of pristine white powder on top of the ten inches of existing snow left in the wake of a little surprise storm two days ago. Today's storm had held off just long enough for everyone to make the slow arduous commute to work. Before lunchtime, with the storm intensifying by the minute, it had become obvious the weatherman had been right for a change. The last thing I heard on the Weather Channel before I walked out my front door was that today would be a great day to stay home and snuggle up in front of the TV with a good movie. If you must go out he recommended that you leave your car in the garage and drive your dogsled instead. This wasn't going to be one of those Alberta Clippers like we normally get, it was the dreaded Nor-Easter. He was calling for somewhere around two feet of the white stuff from hell. The news media had already dubbed the storm The Saint Valentines Day Fiasco. Snowplows in the District of Columbia, Maryland, Virginia, and West Virginia were fighting a losing battle with little hope of ever catching up to the intense snowfall. We're not use to a lot of snow around here; three inches is usually enough to paralyze the city and its surrounding communities. There are times when living close to work can have its drawbacks, but on a day like today it is heaven sent. It's only a two-block walk to my apartment.
