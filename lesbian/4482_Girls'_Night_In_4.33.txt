 Sometimes the world seems a dull old place, thought Renny, as she contemplated the gray, overcast Michigan sky through her apartment window one Wednesday afternoon. Her mood was as cheerless as the weather. What you need girl, she said to herself, is something to lift your spirits…thinks…what haven't I done for ages that might do the trick? I know! I'll invite Amy and Sue over, get in plenty of good wine and we'll have a girls' night in. 

Now, Renny, Amy and Sue had been the closest of friends for years. There's nothing they didn't share with one another; they trusted each other implicitly. It was in their teens that the 'terrible trio' (as they were then known) first became inseparable. Over the subsequent two decades, the bond between them had only grown stronger. They had rejoiced in one another's triumphs and consoled one another in times of heartache or anguish.

Renny phoned Amy then Sue and was elated to hear that they were both up for it and that all three had no other commitments that Friday night. Over the years, their 'girls' nights in' had become something of a ritual or institution, generally taking place every two months of so. But since Sue's marriage to Mike (who seemed to resent his wife having such close, longstanding ties with the two women, and who knew they did not care much for him), their girly get-togethers had become less frequent; the last one had been as long as six months ago.
