 "No, Ali, I didn't give the paperwork to Janice," Sami's voice said over the speakerphone.

I thought that Ali was going to stroke out when we heard that bit of news, then waiting the 'right' amount of time for the hook to be set in our mouths, Sami followed with, "I gave it to Gina, who drove over to pick it up for Janice," hesitating a second, then laughing.

"Gotcha', didn't I, girls," Sami boastfully said to us.

"Sami, I'm going to spank your ass when we get home for almost giving me a heart attack," Ali said, trying very hard not to chuckle at having been 'got'.

"Promises, promises; Oh wait, that's what you say, isn't it?" Sami laughingly said to her.

Getting serious now, Sami went on, "Janice had to go to Baton Rouge to meet with a client, Ali, and asked if it'd be alright if her assistant, Gina, could pick up the paperwork. I told her that wouldn't be a problem and so, the firm has the paperwork and will file it when Janice gets back from B.R., okay?"

"Okay, Sami; anything else before we hang up?" I asked her.

"Yeah, I've set up a meeting with a website designer, or at least I will when you tell me when you want it."

"Handle it, girlfriend, that's your responsibility now, okay? If you're unsure about something, we'll talk about it, but otherwise, 'do your thing' Sami-girl." Ali answered for us.

"Got it," she said, and wishing us a safe trip home in a couple of days, we ended the call.

"Girl scared the shit out of me when she pulled our chain like that," Ali remarked, smiling a bit.

"I could tell; you should have seen your face," I teased.

"It was funny, wasn't it, the way she pushed my buttons," Ali conceded.

"Oh yeah, more than you know," I agreed.

"So are we going to get dressed and go play golf, or what?" She asked, stretching her arms over her head, working out the kinks from her back.

"Or what," I stated as I kneeled before her, spreading her legs apart and lowering my head to her nookie.
