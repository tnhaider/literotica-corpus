I feel strange writing this down. No, not strange ... guilty. I don't know why I feel that way, because it doesn't make sense; but I do know what's causing it and maybe if I put it on paper then it won't be in my head any more. Then maybe I can sleep again at night. Let the damn paper feel guilty.

But here's the thing: I'm not completely sure I want it out of my head. How's that for messed up? Pretty frickin' perfect, I should think; perfectly messed up is exactly what it is. The truth? I haven't felt this excited ... this alive ... since my honeymoon. I think that's why I feel guilty; not because what I'm feeling is wrong -- I don't think it is -- but because these feelings should be reserved for Nick, my husband.
