 This story feels like it's going to be fairly long, sorry for those of you looking for instant gratification.

The following story is a work of fiction. Any resemblance between these character and events and any real person or events is strictly coincidental. 

Do not reproduce or copy this story without the consent of the author.

The following story contains lesbian sex so if that isn't your cup-of-tea, I suggest you try another story. 

A final note: My deepest apologies to everyone who enjoyed the first two parts of this story and have been waiting a long time for me to start posting again. I was hit by a combination of entering college and a few personal tragedies. Hopefully, I will be able to finish up this story within the year, I get side-tracked frequently by work/school.

Thank you for reading.
