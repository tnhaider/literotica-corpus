 The old adage, "The Nose Knows," is one of the truest sayings ever spoken. Basically, it means; the damn thing never forgets. Once a scent has been processed by whatever mechanism the nose possesses, that particular aroma will be forever marinated into the brain. This is especially so if the odor is associated with something pleasant.

Not too long ago I came across a special scent that has since been responsible for causing me more wet dreams than everything else in my life, combined.
