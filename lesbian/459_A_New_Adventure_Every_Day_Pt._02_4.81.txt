 PART 2

This is the second part of the story of Sam and her new life. This is one, continuous story, so this part will not make a great deal of sense unless you have read Part 1, which can be found here:

Thanks must go to Winterreisser for his editing and suggestions and for correcting my silly typos and repeated mistakes. Thanks also to Kat for her advice, encouragement and all round niceness.

FAIR WARNING: While this story (all six parts) is, at its heart, a lesbian romance (hence its categorization), it does contain pee play and also scat (shit) play in this and later parts. If you have an aversion to such sexual activities then please, please do not read this story. I cannot make it clearer than that!

After reading, please take a moment to rate the story and, if you have the time and inclination, comment on it; this has taken many hours of writing so it would be good to hear what you think of it.

I hope you enjoy the story.

CHAPTER 7 - 'There seems to be limited fun without you'

I'm awake early and recall my latest nocturnal adventure. Was there someone watching me or was it, as seems most likely, just my over excited imagination? And I was excited, I remember. Naked and peeing outside, fingering myself, pee splashing me and then cumming, lying in the long grass... I am aroused again as I rise and head down to the bathroom. I hesitate then climb into the bath and lay down, the white enamel cold against my back. I reach down and cup my hand over my vulva and I feel my excitement increase. Relaxing, I begin to pee, only to gasp as the hot fluid immediately fills my hand and flows over the skin of my sex. 

This feels so kinky and erotic, just like last night, and I begin to rub my hands over my body, coating myself in urine. My arousal is intense and I cannot stop, cannot resist coating every square inch of myself, as I writhe in the bath while my fingers go to work on my pussy once again. Three fingers are again deep within me while my other hand is flat over the top of my slit, the fingertips rubbing rapidly back and forth across my clitoris. My panting cries echo in the confines of the bath as they grow faster and louder. A first shudder silences me and then the climax takes me, my fingers pressing hard on my clit.

I feel the post orgasmic lethargy begin to pass. I am in my bath and covered in piss, I point out to myself, trying to gauge my feelings about this. I know I should be disgusted by what I've done but the dominant feeling is: 'Fuck, that was so hot!'

I stand and see a rivulet of yellow running to the plughole and my hands unconsciously roam over my slick skin. The smell of piss is mild, not the acrid scent I expected from public lavatories, and I find it is not unpleasant even a little arousing, given what I've just done. As I turn on the shower and start to wash I know this will not be a one off, despite the fact that I've always believed myself to be a sexually unadventurous woman with an average libido. Perhaps the country air is doing things for me.

I spend the day pottering about. I contact the phone company to sort out getting Internet access, check my bank account, pay some bills and read a novel. After lunch I also start preparing lasagne - for two. She said we'd go for a run tomorrow, so we need to sort that out, I tell myself, and that I'm also in danger of becoming isolated if I avoid seeing people. The simple truth is I miss her.

The truth is also that I know very little about Meg and her life; I certainly don't know what time she arrives home and so, rather than spending the afternoon looking out the window like some demented Neighbourhood Watch member, I copy her idea and put a note through her letterbox. It takes several drafts until I'm fully happy with it:
