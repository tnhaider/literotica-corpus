 To mark the (slightly over) one year of me submitting stories to this site, I thought I would do a Halloween special. The origins of this story began with a play on the High Plains Drifter / Pale Rider westerns, but as I began to write it up, I had a slightly better idea. So I stirred in a little sprinkle of Folk Lore and a song I was listening to on the radio, and put this together. I am not expecting this to be a bestseller, just a short story idea I had while chatting to a few friends from this site, but I am fairly pleased with the result. I hope everyone else enjoys it as well.

I would like to thank Valerie for adding a little depth to the main character, and also to thank Wax Philosophical for being there to bounce the ideas off.
