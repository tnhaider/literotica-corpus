 A/N: This is a story set in the first half of the nineteenth century in England. The Victorian era was the first time period where society truly brought forth the question of a woman's role in the world. People questioned what an "acceptable" level of independence was for a woman, what her extent of involvement in the outside world should be, etc. Though this was also expected to be molded into the view of a woman through the traditional lens: her role as a pure, virginal, faithful wife, expected to rear children, keep the house, and a family.

This story is meant for pleasure, yes, but also to portray these conflicts. It prods at the Victorian era's idea of God, religion, sin, hypocrisy, double standards, etc. And, of course, it's got lesbians. We all love historical lesbians.

A few notes before you begin:

- Unmentionables/underthings: Underwear, but also included the chemise and stockings

- Chemise: A thin, knee-length gown that was the first layer of clothing for a lady

- Connect: To have sexual intercourse with

- Bathing: The wealthy often had servants assist them with bathing, as there was no indoor plumbing until about 1880. It was not unusual for a woman to have handmaidens undress her in her chambers.

- Bedrooms: It was also not unusual for a wife and a husband to have separate bedrooms.

And of course, every character in this story is above the age of eighteen. Florence is in her early twenties, actually. Enjoy!
