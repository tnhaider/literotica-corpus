 Monday's suck. But they suck a whole lot less when you know there's someone thinking about you.

I awoke to a chilly and rainy, Monday morning. I had gone to bed at a good time but was in a pensive, wistful mood when Julie left. I couldn't get to sleep and stayed awake late thinking about her and our fun weekend. I loved spending time with her and was sad when she had to go home. It seemed early when my alarm went off and I was still in a funk from the night before. I didn't want to get up, let alone go into work. I reached for my phone to hit the snooze button and saw I had a text from Julie.

A single red heart.

I smiled at her text and my whole Monday morning misery disappeared. I sent a single red heart back to her, rolled over and had a happy doze until my alarm went off again.

I hit the shower, made coffee, fed Kisa, threw on a skirt and a pretty blouse, scooped some leftover spaghetti into a bowl for my lunch, and ate a quick breakfast before heading out the door.

I got into the office a bit in the early side, sat down and booted up my machine. I was logging in and had just plugged my phone in to charge when a text popped up from Julie.

[Good morning, Sweetie!]
