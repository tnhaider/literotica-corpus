"Watcha' doing, Lynn?" Sami asked of me when she entered the kitchen area, reaching for a mug and the coffee pot.

"Scrolling through the photos you've taken since we've been here," I said, my eyes studying the images on my laptop's screen.

"Uh, have you gone through them all yet?" She asked, a bit of concern on her face.

"If you mean, have I seen the shot you took of Mel as she was going down on you? Yeah, I've been through them all," adding, "that shot aside, Sami-girl, you have a really nice 'eye' for photography; good symmetry, nice light balance, really a very nice group of shots."

She did; she had an incredibly great sense of photography, I saw it within the first few shots she had taken since we've been here.

"Have you always had a good feel for photography," I asked, trading places with her so that she could check her email.

"Yeah, I guess," She said, "I've always considered photography a true art medium, and though I'm 'okay' with pen and ink and charcoal, I really prefer the camera, when it's all said and done."

"You want to work with me on some of my projects when we get back?" I asked, serious with the offer.

"Really?" 

"Yeah, I think that'd be a good thing for you; a little field experience never hurts," I said, adding, "Now, get your ass in gear, our tee time is in an hour," heading off to the shower.
