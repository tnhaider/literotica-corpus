 This is the story of Sandra. This story runs parallel to Whom You Least Expect Ch.2. She is not a saint nor demoness, she is intriguing. You may love or hate her. This is not romance, and has an element of D/s. This story should be read in order (Chapter 1 & 2 first) or it won't make much sense. Thanks to mikseventeen for editing my work. Disclaimer: All characters in this story are 18 years old or older.
