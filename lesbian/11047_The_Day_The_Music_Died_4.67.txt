 What is with this category that I keep returning to it? From no lesbian stories in my repertoire at the beginning of the year to this being my third. I guess I can safely say it's because of you readers and the great feedback you give me. I hope you like this offering as well.

This story features the character of Heather from my "How To Catch a Falling Star" story, though you don't need to have read that to understand this storyline.

The first half of this story is not entirely fictional. It is a sad truth, one that happens quite often.

DISCLAIMER â€“ This story has scenes of angry sex, fisting, biting, blood play and spanking.

A huge vote of thanks to my evergreen editor, NaokoSmith, who has the onerous task of supplementing my awful knowledge of food and wine. Another vote of thanks is due to my new editor RuzieD.

"If you look for truth, you may find comfort in the end; if you look for comfort you will not get either comfort or truth only soft soap and wishful thinking to begin, and in the end, despair."
