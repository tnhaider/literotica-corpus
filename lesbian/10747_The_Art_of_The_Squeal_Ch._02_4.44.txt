 Smokey Saga #75: "Squeal II: The Art Of The Sequel"

*****

The consensus re: the original story "The Art Of The Squeal" (Saga #63) was that a sequel indeed be in order. So while it may have taken me a while to get around to it, here it is. If you liked the playful bondage and torment elements in the original, I'm sure you'll be fond of and pleased with this sequel. Enjoy, loyal Readers. I have loved being a part of your lives.
