 Smokey Saga #72: "Eleven"

 *****

This is semi-adapted from a play script I wrote around the turn of the 2010s. A carbon-copy of that would not work very well as an erotic narrative. Well, it might, but most would find it far-stretched and far-fetched. So I feel what I came up with here turned out better. Hope you like it. Please enjoy, like each time, and you know your feedback is welcomed, valued and appreciated. Cheerios.

Update: I originally submitted this on February 24th, 2017, and it was rejected, as I realized I forgot one of Lit's rules. It takes Literotica several days to approve and publish a story, and actually even longer to let you know if it's been rejected. So...as a result, February '17's story has not/did not make it onto the site until March. My apologies for that; I forgot the rule, like I said, it's on me. But this shouldn't disrupt the timing or publication of March '17's eventual story. Thanks again, folks.
