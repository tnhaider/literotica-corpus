 "Okay, don't forget to call Janice when you get home and she'll come by to pick up the papers from you," Ali was telling Sami before she boarded her flight.

"Ali, this is the fourth time you've told me, honey; I've got it, I know what I need to do, okay?" Sami responded with a bit more patience than I would have had by the fourth time.

One last hug and kiss to both of us, and the new COO (Chief Operations Officer) of Lynn's Alley, Inc. boarded her flight back to the mainland and, eventually, back to N'awlins.

Once Sami had recovered from the news that we dropped on her like a bombshell the other morning, the three of us spent the next two hours tossing ideas around, etc., about the business.

Sami wanted us to set up a website and asked if I could design us a website.

"I could, baby, but there are those who could do it better; I agree with the website idea, I'm just saying that we get a top-notch designer to do it, and do it right the first time."

That was the first decision made by the officers of Lynn's Alley, Inc. Then, like other corporate officers, they went to play golf.

On Sami's last night on the island, the three of us went out for our red meat fix to the Steakhouse, and then we went home and made love. 

The three of us, in bed, are so 'in sync' that it's scary at times, but it's always enjoyable, pleasurable, and measurable in terms of the love the three of us had for each other.

No, of course it's not usual, not even close, but whatever we have, for whatever reasons that we have it, works for us; for now, it was more than enough.
