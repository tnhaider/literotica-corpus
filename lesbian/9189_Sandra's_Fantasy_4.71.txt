Synopsys: This story comes from a reader's fantasy about how a woman's secret desire to be dominated by a younger girl leads her on a submissive adventure.

Editor's Note: This story is written from multiple points of view. I will list at the start of each section which character's POV is being used. As you might expect, we will start with Sandra, a 40-somthing divorced executive whose fantasy is the basis for this story. Enjoy.

*** Sandra's POV ***

My name is Sandra and this is my story. The names have been changed to protect the guilty and the satisfied. I'm in my 40s and still turn heads, at least if you're interested in a mature blond with a curvy figure. If you want a 22 year old hard body, I'm not it. That is my daughter. I was married, but that is over now. If I was a man you would have said my career caused too much stress on my marriage. I am an executive and work long hours. I am driven by success and take no prisoners in the workplace. I close million dollar deals before lunch and inspire terror in my staff in the afternoon. I'm not proud of the second part of that confession but my relentless drive for success compels me to drive my direct reports hard. All day long I'm making the big decisions and as they say, that's why I get the big money.

In hindsight, I should have treated my husband more like a partner instead of an employee. Eventually he strayed to get what I wasn't giving him. Of course that meant I also got the better part of the divorce. I kept our house and got sole custody of our daughter. She was in college at the time and didn't spend much time at home so I was really on my own.

At first, I simply drove myself harder at work. 70-80 hour weeks were the norm. My laser focus on business kept me from thinking about just how pathetic my personal life had become. I didn't have many friends and my business acquaintances mainly just tolerated me. I tried dating a bit, but my domineering attitude turned off my potential suitors. I turned to the Internet and a few dating sites, but rarely had a man ask for a return engagement after we went out one time.

I tried to cut down my work schedule and actually take weekends off. It was a novel concept for me. I tried to start doing "normal" things around town like going to community events, working out at a gym, visiting the nearby parks and going anywhere I'd be surrounded by people. I was trying to jump start a social life and trying to get involved somewhere. I even signed up on Facebook. I'd steadfastly ignored all social media before, but I had to do something. Soon I was on Twitter, although I think only my daughter followed my tweets. In short order I was on other sites creating a full blown on-line persona complete with virtual friends who didn't judge me on my tough exterior.

Surfing the net on weekends became a bit of an obsession for me. I'd get home after work on Friday, eat a quick dinner and settle in for exploring the virtual world. It was during one of these sessions that I happened upon an erotic story website. I'm certainly no prude sexually and my vibrator had been almost my only source of sexual pleasure since the divorce, but reading porn was new. My husband and I had not been terribly adventurous when it came to our lovemaking. Of course I always directed him as to how he should perform. Again in hindsight, my passive aggressive nature in bed probably led him to seek comfort elsewhere. But I digress.

Over time my Friday nights turned into masturbation night. I would read a story to set my mood. I frequently chose stories about women who were walking on the wild side and cheating on their husbands. I guess I was subconsciously wishing I was the cheater and not the cheatee. After reading a few stories I would retire to my bedroom for a session with my vibrator. It wasn't romance, but my body needed the release. My pussy would already be wet. I always resisted the urge to finger myself while sitting in front of the computer. I found waiting until I was in bed seemed to heighten my mood. I would then turn out the lights and slowly tease my body driving my arousal higher. I would close my eyes and think about the story I'd just read imagining myself doing all of the things the female characters did in the story. I'd play with my nipples, rolling them between my fingers and squeezing them just right. I'd run my fingers across my clit, up and down my slit and eventually inside my now dripping pussy. I'd role play being in the story and my fantasy character was brought to climax over and over until I couldn't stand it anymore. Then and only then would I take my vibrator, turn it on full force and slide it into my needy pussy. I'd give myself 15-20 good strokes until I was right at the peak and then pull it out and hold it firmly against my clit. 

That never failed to give me an instant climax. I thrash about on the bed imagining what I must look like. I never climaxed that way with a man. Eventually when I calmed down I'd wonder just how a man would react if he saw me cum that hard and where could I find a man who could make me climax that well.

So that was my life. My daughter, Rose, graduated from college. I figured she would be living at home which might put a crimp into my Friday night "relaxation therapy" sessions as I called them. She did briefly which caused me all kinds of new stress having to time my pleasure around her schedule of being gone, but surprisingly she found a job quickly and announced she was renting a small apartment two towns up the highway. My daughter is a very smart girl. She is very athletic and has the kind of hard body look I could only dream of. She works out at least 2 hours a day to stay that way and when she chose her apartment I found that it was less than a block from a 24 hour gym. Two months after graduation I had the house to myself again. I celebrated with fresh batteries in my vibrator.

It was during my mental foreplay for that night of one-handed sex that I made another discovery. The title of a story in the bondage section of one of my favorite story sites caught my eye. I'd read a few other bdsm stories but they all sounded so farfetched and were so poorly written that they never did much for me. This one was different. For the first time I could connect with the submissive in the story. It was about a submissive guy who was very powerful at work, but paid a mistress to degrade and humiliate him after hours. That night in my bed I made the first connection about giving up the power I always felt from being in control at work and giving it to someone else. I came as hard as I ever had before.

It also started me down a path which brings me to where we are today about a year later. I still work too hard and am always stressed during the week. I still have not found a soul mate to share my life with, although I do date occasionally and try to get out on the weekends. I've even slept with a couple of men I've seen for more than one date, although none of the experiences relieve my stress as well as my submission fantasies and vibrator do. Reading the stories led me to click on a banner ad on the story website for a video site which specializes in humiliation of female subjects. After watching a preview I was off to bed with new ideas to dream about and a very wet pussy begging for attention. Again I had a noisy, convulsing orgasm and soon after I joined the website. The full videos were spectacular but I found that watching them on my 19" LCD monitor left a lot to be desired.

That week at work I overhead one of the office tech guys mentioning he had just build a home theatre PC and was extolling the virtues of it. Normally I would not have even given him the time of day, but it struck me that I have a 55" TV in my living room. Perhaps I could view my websites on it. I think I startled him when I brought up the subject. My office reputation precedes me wherever I go. He was nice however. I think giving him a chance to geek out helped break the ice. I told his theatre PC sounded good and asked where I could get one. He told me he purpose built his for about $1300 and volunteered to do the same for me. Price was not an issue so I quickly jumped on his offer. He told me it would take about 2 weeks. I wrote him a check for $1500 telling him the extra was for installation.

It took three weeks because I only wanted installation on a weekend but soon I had a wicked fast PC running through my flat panel. It could render HD video with no problems, play Blu-Ray discs, was hooked up to my surround sound and had a wireless keyboard so I could control everything from the comfort of the couch. He didn't know it, or maybe he did, but he had built an Internet masturbation addict's dream.

Although Friday night was my customary "me" night, I made an exception that week. Believe me, watching naughty videos on the big screen gave them a whole new meaning. It was also the first time I masturbated while watching the show, instead of retiring to my bedroom. I was so drawn in by the images flashing before me that I began playing with myself right on the couch. Later I would beat myself up for doing it, but caught up in the moment I couldn't help but slide my hand inside my panties.

I found my love tunnel slick with need. I imagined myself replacing the girl in the video. I was on my knees in a bar. A stern woman was directing the bar patrons to use my mouth for their pleasure. My throat was dry, but my pussy was wet. Soon my saliva glands began to go into overtime filling my mouth as I held my throat in my hand like the woman in charge was doing to her sub in the video. I pictured man after man forcing his cock into my mouth and then spraying my face with his seed. While one hand held my neck, the other was busy down below. My fingers we doing a dance across my clit and my arousal was building fast. The woman now directed her charge to bend over a bar stool and the men took turns fucking her from behind. This was too much for me. I erupted as spasm after spasm coursed through my body. My climax lasted over a minute as I rocked back and forth on the couch eventually sliding off the cushions and onto the floor. My body continued to enjoy mini-cum aftershocks as I sat watching the action, although not touching myself. Sitting on the floor in a puddle of my own goo I decided the new PC was the best investment I'd ever made and I knew that Friday nights would be spent in the living room from now on.

And they were. Over the next few weeks my setup became more elaborate. I would light several mood setting candles and always dress in silk lingerie. I'd have a few glasses of wine and have some soft music on while reading a few stories to get me in the mood. I'd then switch to video. I'd try to hold back from masturbating as long as I could. Usually this was at least 5 whole minutes.  But soon I'd be soiling my panties and fondling my breasts. The story was always the same. Regular hetro video didn't do much for me but one where a woman is submissive would leave me panting. It was at this point I started thinking that maybe that was what was missing from my life. That maybe my life of always being in control needed to be challenged for me to find true happiness. I came soon after thinking that. Whether my climax was the result of that thought I don't know, but from that point on I was preoccupied with the concept of finding somebody to submit to.

Unfortunately that is more of a challenge than it would seem, at least in my town. I tried a couple of Internet chat rooms which specialize in BDSM, but none of the people I met seemed to fit the bill. Not that I didn't receive many offers, but they all seemed creepy and untrustworthy. I decided that finding a master probably wasn't in the cards. That Friday night I once again went through my living room ritual. The candles, the wine, the soft music, the lingerie and then bondage chat, stories and video before finally blasting off. I didn't realize it but I had left the first floor windows open that week. I'd been airing out the house and forgot to close them. As fate would have it, that simple mistake set in motion a series of events that would change my life.

*** Rose's Point of View ***

Since before I graduated college I had dreamed of being out on my own. My mother was hard to live with. We got along fine and loved each other, but her workaholic nature and constantly being under stress translated to an unhappy home environment. I knew as soon as I could I would move out. Fortunately the opportunity presented itself quicker than I thought. My brief time at home after graduation was actually better than I had remembered summers and break periods from the last few years. I couldn't put my finger on it, but my mom seemed more relaxed on the weekends and in better spirits. Still I figured that was temporary. As soon as the next important project started at work she'd be back to her old self so I got an apartment and set out on my own. I figured I would still visit as time would allow since I wasn't far away. But as soon as I started my own business career, I began to understand some of the stresses my mom was under. I'd always been a hard worker in school and I found the demands in the workplace were even tougher. I didn't work as hard as my mom, but I still worked a lot of overtime and could feel my social life slipping away. It was a struggle to make ends meet. I didn't want to have a roommate which meant limited discretionary spending. In fact, not going to clubs and other places where twentysomethings gather was putting a deep crimp in my sex life. College had been very free and easy when it came to sex and now that I was in the real world I missed my casual hookups. Sure I could have walked into a bar and within no time walked out with a guy for the night, but somehow that didn't seem responsible anymore. I was looking for a relationship now, although my resolve had been dwindling as the days without sex turned into weeks and then a month.

It was my lack of recent sexual expression that led me to be outside my mom's house that Friday night. No, I wasn't going to a bar with her to cruise for guys. I was meeting my best friend Jeannie who lives next door. Growing up Jeannie and I were inseparable. She had also just graduated but was still living at home for the time being. I figured I'd make a surprise visit at my mom's and then head next door. As it turned out, I was the one who got the surprise.

I parked in front of Jeannie's house and then walked up my mom's walkway. For all the money she earned, she still lived in a modest Cape Code house in a middle class neighborhood. I loved the house as it was the one I grew up in and the maintenance wasn't too bad for her. Anyway... as I walked up the short path leading to the front door, I heard sounds I wasn't expecting to hear. Clearly they were the sounds of sex. More specifically, I heard the sounds of a woman begging to be fucked. What the heck was going on? I could see a flickering light from the picture window which dominated the living room. The dining room on the opposite side of the door appeared dark as did the bedroom windows upstairs. I cautiously continued to the door.

The source of the sounds was definitely the living room as I noticed the window was open about six or eight inches. Instead of ringing the doorbell I felt compelled to peak through the window. The blinds were shut, but a steady breeze had them swaying a few inches. What I saw stunned me. On the screen of my mother's TV was a young bound woman. Her wrists were tied behind her back and she was wearing a ball gag in her mouth. If that wasn't shocking enough, her partner was another woman. I couldn't believe my mom was watching this. There had to be some kind of logical explanation. The second woman was behind her bound partner. She was clearly fucking her. As the camera angle changed I saw she was indeed wearing a large black strap-on. I'd heard of such things but never seen one.

The second shock of my evening came when I heard my mother moaning in time with the bound girl. My mom's couch backed to the window so it was more of a challenge to see her as opposed to the TV. I crept through the bushes being careful not to be heard, but I doubt she would have even noticed if I knocked on the window at that point. I tried to get an angle that would let me peer through the blinds and see the couch. It seemed to be a failing effort until a gust of wind moved the blinds an extra couple of inches. I didn't get a good look, but I could see candles on the coffee table in front of the couch. I also saw two stocking covered legs resting on the table. They were spread fairly wide and it was obvious what my mom was doing. To say I was surprised would be the understatement of the year. I was also shaken by the revelation. I didn't have the courage to ring the bell and interrupt her. As quietly as I could, I exited the bushes and sprinted next door to see Jeannie.

She was her usual bubbly self without a care in the world when she opened the door. I knew I was shaking and visibly upset. We made it to her room before she asked what was bothering me. I should have been a little less forward, perhaps, but I couldn't help blurting out "I saw my mom masturbating to lesbian porn."

"Really?" Jeannie asked.

"Really," I replied. "Worse than that the girl was tied up. I don't get it."

"I don't believe you," said Jeannie.

"Go look for yourself," I told her. "The window is open. She's in the living room."

Jeannie didn't say another word. She just walked out of her bedroom. Her family's house is also a two story and her bedroom is over the garage facing out house. In fact my bedroom faced hers. In high school we would talk to each other for hours out the window. From her room I could see her creeping across our front lawn. It seemed like she was there for a long time, but it was probably only a minute or two before I saw her sprinting back across the lawn. Less than 20 seconds later she was back in her room, her breathing labored from her run.

"What happened?" I asked her.

"I ding-dong-ditched her," she said.

"Real mature," I replied. "What did you see?"

"Well, everything was quiet when I got there. I looked through the window and the TV was still on, but it wasn't playing any video. She must have been on the Internet because the screen was displaying a website. I couldn't make out which one. I figured you caught her as she was finishing and was probably in the bathroom freshening up. That's went I decided to ring the doorbell to make her worried."

"That wasn't very nice," I told her. "I wonder what site she was looking at."

"Do you still have a key to the house?"

"I do. Why?"

"We can sneak in and look at her history. I doubt she clears it each time she, ah, let's her fingers do the walking."

I playfully hit Jeannie on the shoulder. "That's mean."

"Seriously. If you want to know what she's up to, we sneak a peek when she's not home. You'll learn all about her."

I didn't like the idea of spying on my mother that way and I told Jeannie that. She told me if I changed my mind, she'd be glad to help. I told her I wasn't going to change my mind and that we should get going before my mom noticed my car. She agreed and we headed out on the town. We didn't speak again of my discovery but we made a date for the next Friday night.

Arriving at Jeannie's house, I once again planned a surprise visit to see my mom. I had talked to her during the week and nothing seemed different in her demeanor. I convinced myself her behavior was a onetime thing after she accidentally stumbled into the porn website. That night I didn't hear anything. I noticed the windows were closed as I walked up to the house. Just like last week all the windows were dark except the living room which flickered. I snuck into the bushes. I couldn't see anything, but if I placed my ear right up to the glass, I once again heard erotic sounds. This time it was of a spanking and moaning that in my mind I positioned as coming from the couch. I think I was more shaken than the week before. This behavior wasn't a onetime thing. It was something my mom must do on a regular basis.
