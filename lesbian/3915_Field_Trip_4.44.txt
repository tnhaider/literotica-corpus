 Thanks to u/voila- for "requesting" this story. They were a pleasure to work with.

Summarized idea: A college volleyball team is invited to visit their sponsor's brand-new underground chemical laboratory. During the tour, an explosion splits up the group and traps some of the girls deep in the facility. They're mostly fine, but who knows what chemicals the explosion might have unleashed?

Contains: orgasm control, aphrodisiacs, and some confusion about sexuality.
