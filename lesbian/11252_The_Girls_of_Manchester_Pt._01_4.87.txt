 Hey, everybody! I know you are familiar with the Girls of Manchester. I promised a rewrite of Chapter 1, but have instead decided to try to revamp the entire series. The story seems to be stagnating and I really need to put a new perspective on things. Hopefully the flow will be a lot better this time around without as many big, blocky paragraphs with no end in sight, lol. I was amazed when I counted the pages I have written on this storyline and came up with 278 pages of material. That is a lot of writing, lol. I just think that I can improve on it and hopefully deliver a better reading experience. 

All of the characters you have seen in the previous iteration of this story line are involved in this one as well. There are a number of differences, however, which I hope will create a better reading experience for everybody.
