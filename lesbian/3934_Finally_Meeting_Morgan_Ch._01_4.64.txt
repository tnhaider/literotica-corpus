 I sat staring at the computer – flushed, nearly panting, and my heart beating so loud I thought I might pass out. The familiar tightening of my nipples and the warmth between my legs gave "voice" to my feelings.

After the most random of happenings that set off this chain of events we were finally going to meet. I guess maybe I should start at the beginning. It's just so damned hard to type with your hands shaking!!

I'm Morgan, 49 years old, living in "Shikaakwa." (snicker – look it up) Single, unattached, lesbian, I work as an administrator in health care. 5 ft, 8 in, 150ish, brown hair, shoulder length, trying to maintain some dignity in my figure with, admittedly, sporadic attendance at a nearby health club. Avid reader, love music, love the water, quiet dinners with good wine, the very essence of boring. Oh, and did I mention I still love watching women's basketball? Me: tongue firmly in cheek.

An online friend told me about this site called "Literotica" and I was enthralled with some wonderful tomes by women writers. Hooked me like a sea bass. So I wander from time to time and find some really fabulous works. When I say "fabulous" I mean zowie!! Not the slam, bam, thank you ma'am nonsense. Nooo sirree. We're talking serious literature here ... some rather short (6-10 pages), some very long, detailed and involved. Yeah there's some blech; gotta kiss a few frogs to find your princess.

In my wanderings, I come across "allyliterally" Hmm. She's penned something called "Delicious Thoughts." In the first line she states the title is a tribute to a woman whose pen name is "DeliciousThoughts." Aha methinks. So off I go to find this DeliciousThoughts. Her "Four Weeks" totally blew me away; I mean, I spent the entire weekend reading, dreaming and ... ummm ... more private things; completely forgetting about allyliterally. Eventually I come back around and find Ally and begin to dig into her work - "Delicious Thoughts."
