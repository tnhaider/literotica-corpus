 "Can you believe we're actually doing this?" Ali asked of me as we got dressed for the opening of our gallery that evening.

No, I couldn't believe it, but yet, it was so.

The opening of the gallery was happening much sooner that either of us thought it could, much sooner than either of us thought it would. We had busted our asses getting our own work ready for the opening, putting in some serious long hours, but with a sense of passion that I've never felt before about my photography.

Maybe it was the knowledge that I now had the time to do what I couldn't before.

Maybe it was the fact that we had each other to lean on when the hours wore on us, and believe me, the hours did do that.

Whatever the reason, it wasn't a pipedream any longer; it was real, it was now, it was truly occurring.

"Did Mike get his section completed to his liking?" I asked as I hopped on one foot while trying to put a shoe on the other.

"Yep, he did, and he's really stoked about being included," she added.

"Hell, he's good Ali, for my tastes anyway," I said.

"And mine, Lynn, I really like his style," she agreed.

Taking my hands in hers, she leaned her head against mine.

"If the gallery turns out to be a horribly bad idea, we'll still do our art, right?"

"Absolutely," I assured her, "you've unleashed my evil twin, the Erotica photographer and she's not going back into her cage," I teasingly said.

"You're more than that, Lynn, your Lower Nine series is brilliant and mark my words, it will be well received; trust me, girlfriend, it will be well received."

She liked it, she felt it; if no one else did, it'd be enough for me.
