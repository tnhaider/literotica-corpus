 Hi Litsters,

After the unexpectedly good reception for my first lesbian story earlier this year, I've decided to try my hand at writing another one. Unlike most other things I've written, this one is a quaint, tranquil romance between an older and a younger woman. I hope you like it.

This story was originally planned as my entry into the Earth Day contest, but a whole lot of work drowned me back then. There are several environmental themes in it.

There is a lot of story before the actual sex comes. If you came here looking for a quick stroke, you will probably end up disappointed. 

All characters and events in the story are fictional. 

A lot of credit is due to my editor, NaokoSmith, who corrects my wrong choices in verbs and wines with equal Ã©lan. Despite her busy schedule and advanced years, she sends the edited drafts back with unerring punctuality.
