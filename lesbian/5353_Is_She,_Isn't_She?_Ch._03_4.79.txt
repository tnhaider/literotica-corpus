 Author's note: This story has a plot and a decent amount of build-up, so if you're looking for a QF, you've come to the wrong place. 

Also, it may be wise to read parts one and two before you continue with three. 

Otherwise, enjoy! 

Obviously, don't reprint without the author's permission, and any similarities between the characters and people/events of real life are, of course, purely coincidental. 

Harmony.
