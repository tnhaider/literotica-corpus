 Without further ado, I present the concluding chapter of Heather Franklin's biggest case to date. I would like to take this moment to thank all of you who take the time to vote and comment on my stories. As a hobbyist writer, your comments and feedback are all the returns I get for the time I invest in writing.

An extra special vote of thanks to my editor, beta reader and general story advisor, Bramblethorn without whose input, this story would read considerably worse than it does. 

DISCLAIMER â€“ There is mention of graphic violence against a child in this story. Don't read further if such material makes you uneasy. There is also one scene of BDSM.

"Red: Let me tell you something my friend. Hope is a dangerous thing. Hope can drive a man insane."
