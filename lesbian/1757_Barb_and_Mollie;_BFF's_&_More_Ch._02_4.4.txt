 They hit a lingerie store... or perhaps 'struck' might have been a better word. Somehow en-route to the store the girls had managed to get their soaked thongs down off their butts; stepping their high heels out of them before tucking the soaked underwear into each other's purses, (as pervy little chick-scented mementos of a brunch that went better than expected)! Now fully air-conditioned below their hemlines, both ladies needed something lacey and new. They flipped through the racks of thongs and unmentionable lady-briefs, selecting several items as they cackled and snickered off the last effects of their mealtime cocktails.

Barb now looked in the direction of the sales assistant. He was texting away like machine-gun fire to a possible conquest that night named Geoff and wasn't paying much attention to these two customers. She cleared her throat at him with a slightly do your fucking job sort of AHEM.

"Yes I am sorry honey," he answered, looking busted, "how can I help you?"

"Changing rooms?" Barb answered.

She sounded slightly peeved but it was more from sexual impatience. Funny, she'd just busted her girly nuts back at the restaurant and now... they were itching again. This guy was just trying to do the same thing she wanted to do, she should have been more patient but... OH DAMN Mollie looked good and smelled just the way she did all those years ago.

No problem. It was a win-win. The clerk led the girls promptly to the changing room and unlocked it and in return he saw the amount of stuff they wanted to try on and he knew with the potential sales commission, he could treat Geoff to a nice dinner. He could also get back to his texting. Like I said... win-win. He shut the door behind the girls.
