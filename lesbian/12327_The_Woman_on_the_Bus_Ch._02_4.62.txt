 Chapter 02: The Text Messages

"So, she sent me that message and it was the beginning of one of the hottest exchanges I've ever had, if not THE hottest. By the end, she had me in such disarray, it would have been difficult to explain to anyone had they walked in. I probably looked like I just got fucked by an army." I said, feeling my blood temperature rise.

"She did that to you?" Gina asked.

"Oh, yes." I nodded.

"Have you done anything with her physically?" Gina questioned. I feel like I'm learning something new about Gina the more I tell this story.

"The story isn't finished, dear." I reminded her, adding that little tidbit to the end to see how she would respond to ever increasing endearments of affection. We've been friends for a very long time and between my experiences with the woman on the bus, and telling the story of it, I sense I may have lit an eternal flame within me.

"Here, look at this." I said, handing her my phone. The text screen was open to the very first text as I described it.

-> I missed you today. (8:51 pm)


-> What are you doing? (8:53 pm)


-> :) Are you home alone? (8:55 pm)

-> Am I for you? (8:58 pm)


-> I know. (8:59 pm)


-> Well, you looked like a present when I first saw you. (9:00 pm)


-> I don't know. You seem too pretty to unwrap. (9:01 pm)


-> Please, what? (9:02 pm)


-> Of all the girls in the world, I'm the one you were bold enough to approach? (9:03 pm)


-> I bet you say that to all the girls. (9:03 pm)


-> Thank you. (9:05 pm)

-> So, what do I remove first? The bow? (9:05 pm)


-> Like my favorite candy, I will tear your clothes off until the sweet center is mine to eat. No buckle will remain buckled and no button will be spared. (9:08 pm)


-> You will not shiver. I'll hold you close while I enjoy my gift. (9:11 pm)


-> I have already unwrapped myself for you, love. (9:14 pm)


-> It only gets worse from here. I know you watch me as I walk away. Do you imagine my bare skin?


-> Do you imagine your face between my legs, lapping at my juices? (9:16 pm)


-> Do you picture my nipple in your mouth, suckling as a baby does? (9:18 pm)



-> Do you intend to open my gift without me? ;) (9:19 pm)


-> What will you think of? (9:25 pm)

-> My hands opening your silk blouse? (9:26 pm)

-> Your breasts falling into my hands as your bra falls from your body? (9:27 pm)

-> Or will your legs shake thinking of my hand trailing down your body and finding its way into your wet panties? (9:29 pm)




-> Oh. I like a girl who fully commits. Why did you stop there? (9:35 pm)


-> Touche. Is there is a tiny bow on the front of them? (9:38 pm)


-> When that day comes, you will not be able to see mine. (9:41 pm)

-> I don't wear any. (9:41 pm)


-> My fingers are wet. (9:46 pm)


-> No. (9:48 pm)


-> No. You have to wait until I'm ready. (9:50 pm)


-> I would like to teach you how to do that to me. (9:54 pm)


-> Are you shaved? (9:57 pm)


-> I like a little hair to tickle my nose as my tongue explores you. (10:01 pm)


-> Almost, sweet girl. (10:05 pm)


-> When do you want to have me? (10:09 pm)


-> I kind of figured that out, love. When do you want me? (10:12 pm)

-> When do you want to unbutton my pants and slide your hands down and feel how wet I am for you? (10:13 pm)

-> Slide a finger inside me while I kiss your ear. (10:14 pm)

-> Fuck me as I begin taking off your clothes. (10:14 pm)


-> I think the bus driver would not be happy, but we would put on quite the show for the passengers. (10:17 pm)


-> Oh, an exhibitionist! Would you let them watch as I knelt in front of you, lifted your skirt, pulled your panties to the side and buried my tongue in your vagina? (10:20 pm)


-> How about if I dropped my pants, and told you to finger my pussy from behind?


* recorded sound * (10:28 pm)

-> Go ahead, love. Let the volcano inside you erupt. (10:28 pm)


-> :) (10:36 pm)


-> Oh, but I do. Remember, I'm the lesbian here. You're simply my trainee. ;) (10:37 pm)



-> Nice to meet you! Lol I'm Melissa. (10:29 pm)


-> We'll figure it out, don't you think? (10:31 pm)


-> I'm going to reread this, with my vibrator against my clit and cum again. (10:32 pm)


-> I'll look for you Monday morning! <3 (10:33 pm)


I watched Gina as she read every line, her eyes darting from one side of the screen to the other. Her thumb on the screen, scrolling as fast as she can read. Curious, however, I looked and noticed her other hand between her legs. To the common observer, she was just bored and fidgeting, but I noticed her finger gently rubbing herself, too slow for any real pleasure. 

"What is this audio?" She asked with a slightly crinkled brow.

"Turn the volume down and play it with the speaker next to your ear." I said, smiling.

She did, and during the playback, her eyes got wider and wider. The finger that was gently massaging her sped up just a little.

She's turned on, and in a big way. But is it the story, or does she want in? I haven't even told her about just this past week!

I'm going to tease her.

"I came two other times that night. Then, when my husband came to bed, I sucked him hard then made him fuck me as I retold him the story. Not that I really had to make him fuck me, he came into the room naked, and as soon as he saw me sprawled out on the bed, hair a mess, his cock rose to the occasion." I smiled while whispering to her.

She looked at me with wanting eyes and I knew it.

"We've been here a while. Would you like to hear about this passed week, or would you like to..." I said, pausing to allow my eyes to follow her body from her eyes to where her hand was, "wait until next time? I'd hate to overflow you with too much at once."

She bit her lip, slightly and just for a moment.

"Let's wait. I'll get the check this time. Thank you."

I knew what she was thanking me for.

In the next chapter, Gina surprises Christy in an unexpected way.
