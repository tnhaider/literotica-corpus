 Smokey Saga #60: "A Night At Millicent's"

*****

Sixty! Another Smokey milestone. Enjoy, bibliophiles, this one's for you! Forgive me if I left out anyone's preferred sections laying out this little shop of wonders. This story is dedicated to you, Reader—yes, you; you rock!—and also to any British fans I may have, in particular. This story highlights my Anglophilia. Even though I'm American and the story takes place in America (Juniper, MN, like all of mine), this is written from a Brit's P.O.V. Aren't dedications great? They're free, and can encompass whomever you choose them to. I haven't dedicated that many stories because I suspect most of them would be to the same individuals—the Readers as a whole. But, you know who you are, and you know how much you mean to me. And as always, your feedback is welcomed, valued and appreciated.
