 Welcome to my latest story. It is quite lengthy but I hope you'll find it worth the effort.

This is a tale of love and romance. Max is a cruel, heartless man; a misogynist, a sexual predator and a user of women whose twisted and selfish view of love is challenged by a divine punishment. Can the Goddess's retribution change him and teach him what it is to love women and help him become a real, complete person?

Oh, and in case you're worried by the paragraph above, this story is in the right category! (This has been a difficult story to categorize. It was previously published in "Romance" but I feel that the change of category is appropriate.)

Whilst this is not exactly a sequel, Max first appears in my previous, three part story 'Such a Little Thing', and this tale picks up his life some ten years later. This story also features Amber, the heroine of 'Such a Little Thing', and inevitably this story therefore contains spoilers for this earlier tale but also shows what happened to Amber and Milla. For those of you who want to read it first, 'Such a Little Thing' can be found here: http://www.literotica.com/s/such-a-little-thing-ch-01.

Thanks, as always, to my editor, Winterreisser, for his diligent editing and suggestions and to Kat for her comments and feedback as this story developed.

I wish you happy reading and, as ever, feedback through comments and/or votes are very welcome.

PROLOGUE

On the low rise of a small grass-covered hill on the edge of Elysium, with unobtainable Olympus rising in the far distance, the tholos stood. The gleaming white marble of the circle of Ionic columns, supporting the red-tiled roof, glinted in the clear, bright sunlight as a perfect cooling and fragrant breeze played over the greensward, nodding the delicate flowers that spangled the grass.

In the centre of the circular temple, the air thickened and a vision of absolute beauty condensed into being as the Goddess manifested herself, her exquisite form clad in the shimmering pale gold of her diaphanous robe. The three women waiting there bowed and made obeisance before the divine beauty now in their midst.

"Speak to me, daughters of Nyx," commanded the Goddess.

"Oh Goddess, you demanded of us to know the complaints against the man and we fear that they are legion," Eris replied.

"Show me the nature of these grievances, sisters," the Goddess instructed.

Oizys stepped forward slightly, and made passes with her hands; the air in front of her shimmered and a vision appeared:
