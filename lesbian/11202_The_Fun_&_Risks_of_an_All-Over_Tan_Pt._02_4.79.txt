 Here is the promised sequel to "The Fun & Risks of an All-over Tan". The original story was, I accept, somewhat abrupt in its ending - my excuse is the pressure of writing for a competition deadline! Hopefully this rather longer second part will give a more satisfying conclusion.

I hope you find it enjoyable and do, please, take a moment to rate the story. Feedback and comments are always very welcome as I love to hear the thoughts and opinions of readers.

As ever, I must give my very great thanks to Winterreisser for his diligent editing, encouragement and suggestions.

Happy reading,

Sue

Prologue

"'Do elves live in these woods?' he asked," I read in my Frodo voice.

"'Not that I ever heard,' said Pippin. Frodo was silent. He too was gazing eastward along the road, as if he had never seen it before. Suddenly he spoke, aloud but as if to himself, saying slowly:" 

I feel Dylan snuggle in against me as I sit on the bed next to him. I glance from the book, a big illustrated copy of 'The Lord of the Rings' that I borrowed from Dad when Dylan insisted that was the next book he wanted read at bedtimes after we finished reading 'The Hobbit'. At just under ten I suspect he may be a bit young for 'The Lord of the Rings' but he seems to have enjoyed the first two and a bit chapters so maybe I'm wrong.
