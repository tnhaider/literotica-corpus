 Smokey Saga #61: "Special Deliveries"

*****

This story's adapted from an idea suggested by a Reader and friend called Henry. It's an original concept I've never seen done before...then again, that's also the case with lots of plots I shape about lesbians. It's always interesting and novel when women take on the kinds of decisions and issues normally faced by men. Which is something that (eventually) happens here. This is now the longest story I have written and posted. But there are three good sex scenes for you to enjoy throughout.

 Oh, by the way...what with the unabated bomb proliferation running amok—and a feeling I'm getting that they're no longer being swept—score voting's back off. So at this point I'll say sorry about that, but hasten to add that just like last time, if you don't like the voting turned off, you know whom to thank. Regardless, (real) Readers, your feedback is still welcomed, valued and appreciated.
