 "Almost ready for some coffee?" Sami asked when she stuck her head in the bathroom as I showered.

"I will be in just a few minutes, baby, I'm almost through," I answered as I rinsed the shampoo from my hair.

We slept in until almost noon; by the time we had returned to the condo after dropping off Mel, it was almost four in the morning; so yeah, we slept in. Our first day for golf would not be until tomorrow, Monday, so this was a 'free day' for us.

I joined Sami at the breakfast bar, glad to see the big mug of coffee waiting for me.

"What's the plan for today, Lynn Marie?" Sami asked, her eyes smiling at me.

"No plan; nada, nuttin' honey," I said, "Toss some ideas around and let's see if one lands on its feet," I said, smiling back at her.

"Well, since the whore-sisters slept late, half the day is gone, but if you twisted my arm I'd suggest hanging here and maybe hitting the beach and water just out of our back gate," She said.

"The whore-sisters slept late because Sami brought some pussy for us to play with to our bed," I said in mock-accusatory tone.

"Yeah, I did; but, I didn't see you kick little Ms. Mel out of bed last night," she retorted.

Chuckling a bit, "Hell no, she was a very delicious piece of sophomoric poon-tang!"

"Yeah, she was all of that, Lynn Marie," Sami said, after a bit, her eyes looking at me over the top of her coffee mug, "and you know what? I'd damned sure do her again."

"Yeah, me too, Sami, me too, baby," looking back at her.
