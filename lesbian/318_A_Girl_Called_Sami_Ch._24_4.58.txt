 The anniversary of Bonnie's death came upon Sami very quickly, and that day, she spent it alone, walking the campus with her camera, shooting tons of film to keep herself busy, and, to keep the demons at bay.

Her insides were absolutely crawling with nervousness, sadness, lonesomeness, and aching with hurt that day. Returning to her suite, she ignored the knocks that disturbed her self-imposed solitude, not even bothering to look at the notes and crap that had been slipped through her door's mail slot.

Retrieving the bottle of Tequila that she had purchased a few days ago, Sami-girl got totally and blissfully drunk late that afternoon, her mind no longer able to deal with the sadness that she felt; and thankfully, she drank herself into a stupor, falling asleep early in the evening.

Falling asleep, or passing out; call it what you will, it brought Sami to where she needed to go.
