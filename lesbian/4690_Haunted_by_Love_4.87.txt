 Welcome dear readers to this, my erotic lesbian romantic ghost story and entry for the "HALLOWEEN STORY CONTEST 2015".

I hope you will enjoy reading it but I feel I should warn t you that it is a lengthy story -- for those who have read some of my other work I hope this means you'll think "Oh goody!" and not "Oh no, not again!"

My thanks, as ever, to my wonderful editor Winterreisser, especially for his speedy efforts that allowed me to still meet the deadline after taking far longer writing this than I expected. Thanks also to Kat for her kind words and encouragement.

As this is a competition entry, do please take a moment to cast your vote at the end; comments and feedback are also always very welcome.

This is now a slightly updated (or updated, updated) version with an extended Chapter 11 and a few corrections.

Happy reading and Happy Samhain!

Sue
