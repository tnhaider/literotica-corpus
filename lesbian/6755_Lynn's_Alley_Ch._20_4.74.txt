 "Road trip!" I announced to Sami and Ali when I walked into the Gallery.

"Road trip?" they both asked at the same time.

"That's what I said; As President of this fucking corporation, I am mandating a get-away sabbatical for us, to clear our heads, and to get in some much needed golf."

Ali and Sami just stared at the ranting bitch standing in the office.

"Seriously, guys, we've been humping it seven days a week since we got back from Hawaii; the Easter weekend is coming up and I've booked us a condo at Gulf Shores, just us, The Three Amigos." 

"And besides, I want to take my new ride on a road trip," I said, finally ending my soliloquy.

"It's always about you, isn't it Lynn," Sami teasingly said, with Ali agreeing. The two of them then started trash-talking about me as if I wasn't there until they couldn't keep straight faces any longer and the three of us had a huge laugh over it.

It was true that we had been very, very busy of late. Ali and I were working with our individual mediums almost exclusively, leaving much of the running of the Gallery to Sami and the two girls, Justine and Tiff. Seeing the need, we brought on another full timer, Jason; a nice quiet gay guy that Ali knew from the art scene. He'd run and worked in some of the best galleries for the past five years or so. He was in a very stable relationship and could smooze the rich bitches with the best of 'em.

I had two photo projects going on at the moment, and Ali was doing a couple of private commissions. The web site was getting a lot of traffic and generating a lot of sales, keeping Sami very busy with that as well.

We had decided to close the Gallery on Good Friday through the Monday after Easter, so we had the time, and the girls agreed that we did, indeed, need to get away for a bit.
