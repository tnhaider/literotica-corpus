 The morning after their make-out session, Sami awoke, and in that still half-asleep stage, she realized that she had another body in bed with her, which confused her at first. 

Slowly, as the fog lifted, the memory of the night previous surfaced and brought clarity to Sami's confused state. Bonnie was still asleep, lying on her back, her skirt up around her hips, and her panties slightly askew, showing some of her light brown pubes.

Moving slowly so's not to wake Bonnie, Sami snaked herself from her own bed. It wasn't until she stood up that the hangover hammer came down, full force, on her head.

Holy fuck, Sami thought, as she struggled to maintain her balance, but that fucking hurts, referring to the pounding headache behind her eyes, pounding away as if trying to break through Sami's skull.

She grabbed her shower crap and cos kit and silently snuck out of the room to hit the showers; right after she swallowed four aspirins, she did make it into the showers.

Standing under the hot water, Sami's mind-movie replayed last night's events, all things becoming clearer to her now. And, as usual, whenever Sami had sexual thoughts, Sami got horny, and standing in the shower, she wasn't too hung over to masturbate, to give herself the orgasm that she didn't get last night.

Funny, she thought, as she let her spectacular orgasm fade from her body, but the climax seemed to have helped the headache. Sami always had spectacular orgasms when she masturbated and absentmindedly began to wonder if she had discovered a cure for hangovers.

Sami opened their dorm room door slowly but saw that Bonnie was awake, sitting upright in Sami's bed, looking like she had been hit by a truck.

"Oh, Sami, my head hurts so damned much," Bonnie said when she saw Sami walking in. Grabbing a bottle of water and opening it, she handed it to Bonnie, followed by four aspirins.

"Take those, baby, and hit the showers; it'll help, believe me; and then we need to find coffee and lots of it, okay?"

"Yes ma'am," was all the response Bonnie could muster while Sami helped her get her shower stuff together.

They walked together to the student dining hall, the sight of the breakfast buffet almost making the both of them sick to their stomachs. It wasn't until the third cup of coffee that they finally talked. 

On the walk over to the dining hall, neither said much, both lost in their own thoughts, it seemed.

"Sami, about last night, I, er, I'm not sure what to say."

"You don't need to say anything, baby; we were drunk, you were curious, and what happens in room 204, stays in 204, okay?"

"Yeah, I know that, I mean I believe that it'll stay between us; I'm not worried about that."

"Then what are you worried about? That you liked it?" Sami said jokingly.

And looking at Sami straight on, her eyes locking with Sami's, Bonnie replied.

"Yes," she said, "I am worried because I did like it; I liked it a lot and I'm not sure how to process all of this."

"Don't worry yourself sick because you liked the way I made you feel, Bonnie; we were two friends, being friendly, that's all, it doesn't mean that you're a lez, or a dyke."

"I know, Sami, but I feel bad because you did it all for me, to me and I didn't do anything about your problem; I mean, I assume that you got horny also."

"Oh yeah, I did, but I took care of myself this morning, in the shower," Sami said, "and last night? It was all about you, baby, and I was a bit scared that if I went as far as I wanted to go, you'd run out of the room screaming."

Bonnie looked at her seriously, and replied, "I wouldn't have done that; I mean, I wouldn't have run away screaming. Sami, I just need some time to process all of this, you know?"

"Yeah, baby, I do know; been there, and done that, myself."

"I just need a little time, that's all," Bonnie repeated.

"So we're still going to be roomies?" Sami asked.

"Oh, I hope so," Bonnie said, a serious look to her face when she said it.
