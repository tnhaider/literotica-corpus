 Sophia let out an emphatic *sigh* when Estelle squealed with glee at the candy store. She watched helplessly as her shopping partner pranced, skipped and bounced simultaneously into the large entrance, quickly lost in the labyrinth of overstuffed bins. Her watch, which she couldn't help but check frequently, informed her that she had checked it less than five minutes ago. With a stern resolve, Sophia walked into the candy store to catch up with Estelle.

"Oooh! Have you tried those ones? They're hella tangy!" Estelle exclaimed as if she didn't even realize that Sophia had just barely caught up with her. She pointed to a barrel of powdery, gummi pen caps attached to real pens.

"No, I can't say that I have. Is that something that Amelia would be interested into?" Sophia's voice was condescending, but Estelle seemed to take no notice of it.

"Maybe. It's hard to tell with that girl; her tastebuds are always changing so fast. Well, I'm going to get me some anyway. Maybe we can share?"

"No thanks."

"Alright, suit yourself."

Estelle disappeared with her bag of candy and met Sophia, who was already waiting at the door. She just smiled politely at her impatient girlfriend and merged back into the mall crowd with her. They walked in silence for a bit, each putting an awful lot of effort into checking out the stores that they passed by so as to not pay attention to each other. Every once in awhile their gazes would cross paths, and they would look away uncomfortably.

"Hey, let's get something to eat at the corndog place. We can watch the girls bounce up and down while they make lemonade," Estelle invited.

"I already ate before I came over. Let's just find a present and get out of here."

Estelle looked hurt, but quickly covered up her expression with that of pleasant surprise when she saw her favorite goth store across the way. "Well, I KNOW Amelia would like something from there. C'mon!"

As much as Sophia was inclined to complain, she had to silently agree that Estelle was right. So she reluctantly let her mall buddy grab her arm and drag her over to the store. Of course, just as quickly as they entered, Estelle once again disappeared. This time, however, the store was not bright like the candy store, so Sophia would have a much more difficult time finding her. The loud, thumping music and abundance of black lights didn't help to improve her disorientation, either.

Amidst the sea of black apparel and items promoting creative uses for leather, Sophia came across a pair of black and lavender lacy panties that she instantly fell in love with. They were refined without being boring, yet playful without being immature. 

Just then Estelle reappeared. She was holding a CD. She immediately noticed what was in Sophia's hand and tried to turn it into a topic of conversation.

"Hey, that's pretty cool. Is that for you?"

Sophia looked at her guiltily, knowing that she was hypocritical for giving Estelle attitude for not staying on the task of looking for Amelia's present. "No. I don't need it."

Sophia put the panties back on the rack, only to have Estelle pick them up again. "They'd look cute on you. You're getting them. My treat."

Estelle grinned at her shopping buddy, who in turn was now turning red with embarrassment and guilt.

"Thanks," was all that Sophia could think to say.

Trevor hesitated before knocking on the door to Sophia's place. He really wasn't looking forward to seeing her, but he wasn't going to neglect giving her belongings back to her. Regardless of how he felt, it was simply proper break-up etiquette. He heard footsteps coming towards him, and silently resolved to stay calm, no matter what words may be said. To his surprise, Raquel, Sophia's roommate answered the door.

"Oh, hi Trevor! Come on in," Raquel was delighted to see him. She always was.

Trevor just smiled and said "I'd love to but I'm late for work. I just needed to stop by and give Sophia this," he said politely, holding up a bag full of various items that she had left over his house.

"Oh well, Sophia's not here right now. Here, let me take that. I think she went to the mall with one of her new friends." Trevor gave a sour look at hearing this, but Raquel didn't quite pick up on it. "SO hey, would you like to come back later tonight? We could have dinner together."

Trevor gave a puzzled look at this suggestion because surely Raquel would know how much it would hurt him to see Sophia unnecessarily.

"Raquel...you do know that we broke up, don't you?

Raquel looked stunned. She appeared to be searching for the right words while taking in this surprising news at the same time. She looked down that the bag and realized why he was giving it to her.

"Why? What happened?" She finally managed to ask.

Trevor sighed heavily. He hadn't really let himself deal with it yet, and he certainly didn't want to moments before going into work. Raquel seemed deeply affected by his inability to say anything and set the bag down, then gave him a hug. As much as he wanted to indulge in the sympathy, he had to remain distant in order to keep his emotions from spilling over. Raquel noticed this and let go awkwardly.

"I don't understand," she began, "you've been together for three years. You guys never argued or fought. You were the perfect couple."

"Yeah well, maybe we were too perfect. Maybe we only looked that way cos there was nothing really there. I dunno. I'll talk to you later about it, ok? Right now I have to go."

He politely kissed her on the cheek while she gently grabbed his arm. She tried to look into his eyes in order to get him to talk more, but he avoided meeting her gaze. He smiled mechanically and turned away, quickly walking back to his car.

"You know, you forget how good these things are," Estelle pondered as she took a bite out of her corndog. Sophia, who was drinking a cup of lemonade, nodded her head in agreement. After she finished the bite, she Estelle continued, "and did you see the size of the tits on that chick? Damn! Too bad she wasn't making the lemonade though."

Sophia couldn't help but smile at this remark. She still felt uncomfortable with Estelle, but for a different reason now. However, she had forced herself to give her lunch buddy some eye contact. It was obvious that Estelle was trying hard to be friends, and Sophia wanted to work through her feelings and return the effort.

"Look, I'm sorry I've been a bitch today," Sophia managed to say. With those words out in the open, however, she found it even more difficult to look Estelle in the eye.

"It's alright. I'm not oblivious to your attitude; I'm just ignoring it. I get it, you like Amelia. But that doesn't mean that we can't get along. You have to understand where we're coming from." The prospect of learning what they thought of her caused Sophia to look up at Estelle. "We don't have to be competition. Amelia wants us both." Estelle looked into Sophia's eyes and said "I want you both. I want this to work."

"Wow...I don't really know what to say," Sophia responded with awe. She really hadn't considered the possibility of not seeing Estelle as a threat. She needed some time to fully digest what had been said to her.

"Well, you could say 'I'm all for that cos you've got the hottest body in the whole mall and I've been thinking of nothing else but raping you the first chance I get'. Or 'Thank you', whatever works."

Sophia laughed and smiled at Estelle as she felt the weight of dread and guilt leave her body. When Estelle reached across the table with her napkin to wipe Sophia's cheek, she gladly held her face out.

Neither of them were looking at anyone else around them. Neither of the girls saw a blonde girl across the food court staring at them. Even if they had, they most likely would have not caught the smile that crept across her face as she observed how they interacted. By the time they had finished with their meals, she had walked out of sight.

The blonde girl walked with a spring in her step to the nearest area that was quiet, then pulled out her cell phone. 

"Hello?" answered Amelia from the other end.

"Hey. It's Kaylin. Hey listen...what's up with you and Estelle?" Kaylin's voice feigned concern.

"What do you mean?"

"Did you guys break up or something?"

"What? No, what would give you that idea?"

"Well I saw her and Sophia running around together in the mall."

"Yeah, I told them to go together. Why would that bother me?" Amelia sounded annoyed, but Kaylin kept her voice steady with concern.

"It doesn't bother you that they're all over each other?"

"Oh please! Sophia and Estelle? Those two won't stick without their glue, moi."

"Uh, Amelia...they were attached at the lips."

Amelia tried not to sound hurt, but her hesitance gave her away. "Well...thanks."

"Sure. And hey..."

"What?"

"If you need to talk..."

"I know, thanks. Later."

Amelia put the phone away and held her head down for a moment, trying not to let the ugly feelings inside her boil to the surface. After all, what did she expect to happen? They had already done quite a bit more than kiss together. She realized that it was the 'together' part that bothered her. She was the one who initiated all the encounters; she wasn't supposed to be excluded from them. 

After struggling with internal dialogue, Amelia managed to reason with herself that they had never discussed such matters, and that was something that they would just have to do when she got home

'Geez girl, get ahold of yourself,' she thought as she went back to work, 'after all, it was only kissing.'

"So, do you believe in angels?" Estelle's voice came from the depths of her closet. Sophia looked up briefly at the sound of her voice, despite knowing that she was out of view. She had to take a moment to ponder that question, for it was completely unrelated to what they were just discussing.

"Uh...no, not really. I don't suppose I do," was her half-hearted answer.

"Well, you might change your mind after you see this," responded Estelle in her trademark bubbly voice. She stepped out of the closet wearing only two things; the lavender panties that she had bought for Sophia earlier, and a pair of feathery white angel wings. At first she stopped and waited for a moment to savor Sophia's awestruck reaction. After a bit, she struck a couple of silly poses that broke the spell on her one-woman audience and caused her to burst out with laughter.

"Amelia and I got them last year for Halloween. There's a black pair, too. What do you think?" Estelle asked as she twirled around so that Sophia could get a good look.

Sophia took no hurry in letting her eyes wander every inch of Estelle's body. Though they had had previous encounters, she realized that she had never actually seen Estelle naked before. The first thing that she focused on was her breasts; they appeared to be sculpted from the palm of cupped hands. Her nipples were the color of a pink rose and inspired in her a romantic gesture in the same way the flower does. The panties were by no means transparent, so she was unable to see that which she would have really liked to. However, the lavender complimented her skin tone well, and looked quite sexy on her.

Estelle watched as Sophia gaped at her body and giggled, "I'll take that as a compliment." Sophia just blushed and looked down.

The angel made her way over to the stereo, swinging her hips in an exaggerated manner as she went. After she turned it on, a trip hop beat began playing. The beat was soon followed by a cello, piano, and a variety of instruments normally associated with classical music. It was refined, yet quite danceable. Estelle proved this by continuing to swing her hips in time with the music while slowly making her way back over to her one-woman audience, who was now completely captivated.

She held out her hand to Sophia and smiled playfully. After a moment of hesitance, Sophia took it and stood up to join her in the middle of the room. She moved her body to the music, but not as enthusiastically as Estelle. She wasn't much of a dancer, and nowhere near as confident in herself as Estelle was. She found herself a little jealous, and wondered if Estelle could have once had low self-esteem that may have been alleviated by a healthy dose of Amelia. She hoped so.

"See, you're having a good time despite yourself," Estelle observed.

"It must be because I'm in the presence of someone heavenly," responded Sophia, which made Estelle smile even wider (if that were possible).

The two girls danced closer to each other, and soon Estelle had her arms around her lover's neck. Her dancing was more subtle now so that she could stare into Sophia's eyes. Sophia found herself intoxicated with her dance partner's energetic fervor. Her charisma became an aphrodisiac, and Sophia began moving a bit more seductively. Her angel seemed to notice this, for she responded by pressing her divine lips against hers. Estelle's tongue swept across the crevasse of Sophia's mouth as she kissed her, causing Sophia to part her lips further.

Estelle leaned in closer, so that her lips were next to Sophia's ear, and whispered, "now do you believe in angels?" 

"I believe in you," Sophia exhaled.

Sophia could stand it no longer. Her hand reached up of its own accord and placed itself on her angel's breast. She bent two fingers so that they could roll the rosy nipple around. Estelle's eyes fluttered in response. She gently bit her bottom lip, but this could not prevent a quiet moan from slipping from her mouth. Sophia stared on, still a little uncertain of herself.

Then Estelle responded further by grabbing the bottom of Sophia's shirt with both hands and lifting it up over her head. However, when Sophia's arms were raised high, but still caught in her shirt, Estelle pushed her up against the wall and held her arms in place. Sophia's wrists were crossed, entangled in the shirt and unable to escape. This seemed to please Estelle, for she smiled wickedly and kissed her lover deeply. The kiss was met with equal passion, and their tongues pushed against one another as they slid back and forth between each other's mouths. 

Estelle, gaining much pleasure from having the opportunity to be the dominant one, pulled her mouth away and stared hungrily at the breasts that were now exposed before her. After savoring the view for an extended moment that caused Sophia to squirm with anticipation, Estelle lowered her head onto her prisoner's chest and began leaving a trail of kisses on a random path between and around both breasts.

Sophia sighed with delight while trying to keep her knees from giving out as the rest of her melted. She didn't think that she would be held up by just the one hand holding her wrists in place. Besides, she was getting too hot to endure much more foreplay.

"Estelle," she beckoned breathily, causing her lover to look up. "Make love to me."

"I thought you'd never ask!" Estelle responded with delight.

She led Sophia by the shirt over to the bed and pushed her down. Sophia let her hands remain tied up and rested them above her head. It didn't appear that her lover needed any assistance as she unbuttoned her jeans and pulled them down. In an unexpected, but arousing gesture, Estelle gave Sophia's mound a single kiss before pulling her panties all the way down, causing a small shiver to travel through her body.

"If I knew that angels were like this, I would have prayed to them instead of to God," Sophia snarked.

Estelle straddled her lover's legs and slid up until their mounds were touching. She placed a hand on either side of Sophia so that she was staring directly down at her. She watched her face react to the pressure before pointing out, "I thought you didn't believe in angels, darling."

"You're my angel now," Sophia replied as she raised her hips as much as she could to meet Estelle's halfway as they rocked back and forth on each other.

Estelle lowered her head so that she could kiss her new believer as a reward for her faith. Their tongues intertwined passionately as the rhythm of their bodies increased. Estelle's wings rose and fell in time with their lovemaking, Sophia watched as the feathers shivered lightly and imagined that her lover was soaring in the celestial skies, holding her close as they made love hundreds of miles above the earth. 

Sophia moaned as her heavenly guardian gently pulled on the side of her neck with her teeth. She longed to reach down and run her hands over every part of Estelle's silky body, but she was also enjoying the feeling of helplessness. She found that having someone else in control was very arousing. In fact, she was so intoxicated by everything that Estelle was doing that her body began to shudder with her first orgasm of the night. Estelle watched her carefully as she came, and seemed to be turned on by it. In fact, her winged lover began to increase the pressure behind her gyrating movements, letting Sophia know that she was nearing her own climax. Estelle soon held her breath and gripped Sophia's arms even tighter. While Sophia was enjoying her lustful imprisonment, she was surprised to see that her angel was staring into her eyes while having an orgasm. For some reason, this was an incredible turn-on, and she reached her head up and kissed her hard. 

Estelle was showing signs of coming down from her pleasure high, as she was slowing her rhythm. However, she was by no means stopping. Sophia knew then that the evening had only begun...

"Estelle?" Amelia turned on the living room light as she called out to her girlfriend with irritation. She noticed that the present that she had left for Sophia was sitting on the table, unopened. This did nothing to improve her mood. She threw her keys on the table next to the present and went to the refrigerator. After she opened a bottle of water and took a swig, she realized that she was hearing faint music coming from the bedroom.

She marched over to the closed door and put her hand on the knob. Although originally intending to swing the door open, she thought better of it and opened it slowly. There on the bed were Sophia and Estelle, both asleep. They were sharing a blanket, entangled in each other's arms. Amelia's eyes narrowed.

"What. The. Fuck."
