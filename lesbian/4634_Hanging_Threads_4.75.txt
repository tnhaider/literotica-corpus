 This is my first romance story, at least the first I purposely planned to be romantic. It has a slow build up, so if you were expecting for a quick romp in the hay please go somewhere else (maybe next time I will write one of those). This story ended up being longer that I expected it to be, it was so hard to write that I don't want to touch another one of these again (if it's well-received I may think about it thought). My thanks go to gentoxic for embellishing my work and Kim (you know who you are) for tinkering with my grammar, I am deeply grateful for your help . All characters are over 18. Any resemblance to actual persons is entirely coincidental.
