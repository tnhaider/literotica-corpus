 Welcome to my latest story. It is not a long as some of my recent stories -- that will no doubt please some and disappoint others -- but I hope you will enjoy it in either case. As ever, comments and feedback are very welcome and, as this is my submission for the 2017 Winter Holiday Story Competition, please take a moment to vote.

Thanks, as always, to Winterreisser for his skilful (and phenomenally speedy!) editing.

A note for my American readers: just to avoid any confusion, mentions of "football" of course means soccer and not American Football. ðŸ˜Š

"No, Mum, I don't have to go!" I insist.

"Okay, Amy, I know: you're eighteen, you're a big girl, you can look after yourself, yadda yadda yadda... I get it. Contrary to what you think, I was eighteen myself once and I know that spending Christmas in the middle of nowhere with a ninety-six-year-old great aunt isn't going to be on your bucket list. Hell, it wouldn't exactly make it onto my list of fifty things I'd rather do than watch paint dry!" Mum's eyes soften slightly and I know she's noticed the slight smile her comments have managed to elicit from me. That doesn't mean she's won though.

"See, even you don't want to go so why are we even discussing this?" I retort with what I feel is a compelling argument. "Life's too short!"

"Life is short, and for what's left to Aunt Winnie, that's definitely true." Mum sighs and I can tell she's going to try a new approach. "Listen, Amy; Winnie can't have much longer and we're practically the only family she has left after Mum going last year." The sadness in Mum's voice makes me wonder if the new tactic is going to be guilt. "Besides, Winnie wrote to ask us to visit her over Christmas..."

"Wrote to me, you mean," I point out.

"Yes, and she seemed to want to see us -- you especially -- so much. Amy, did you not wonder why? This is going to sound horribly mercenary but I need to say it: her money's got to go somewhere when she dies, so perhaps she's thinking of us. Don't look at me like that: I really don't wish any ill on her but you can't pretend what I've said isn't true." I give a reluctant nod; there has to be a reason for Great Aunt Winnie's unexpected invitation so maybe Mum is right. "God knows I do what I can but we're not exactly loaded, are we?" Ah, so it's the 'talk to me like an adult' tactic. "Would it really kill you to spend one Christmas away from your mates?" she adds.

She has a point and what makes it harder is what she doesn't say: she doesn't try to guilt me by pointing out my desire to go to university next year, or that what I make from my part-time job she lets me keep, or even that she's noticed that things have been a bit strained recently between me and Ciara, my closest friend. "Okay," I agree, "but does it have to be..."

"Yes, we're going to go until the Wednesday after Christmas, as she's asked us," Mum states firmly.

"Shit. That'll be, like, six days!"

"Language, Amy."
