 How in the hell had I ever let my so-called friends get me into this mess? I guess alcohol might have been a factor. You know how it goes; you're sitting with a few friends munching on enough junk food to put the Budweiser Clydesdales into a diabetic coma and sucking down beer. Do you have any idea how nasty beer and sugarcoated spice gumdrops taste together?

Since it was only two days until Halloween we had been telling ghost stories to see who could tell the scariest story. And as usual, some drunken fool had to make a silly-ass bet about someone spending the night alone in the old Ramsey Mansion on the outskirts of town. Yeah, you guessed it; I was the intoxicated idiot who took them up on the stupid bet.

The old abandon mansion had a reputation of being haunted. I didn't believe in ghosts, goblins, monsters, or any other creature of supernatural origin. I figured what the hell; I could definitely use the hundred bucks I was going to win.
