 Welcome once more, mes amies, to Smokeyvilleâ€”your comfy little cubby hole for tasty Sapphic sexual torment and heartwarming romance. You're looking well. No, I did not lose control of my bladder; I'm just happy to see you.

We've just passed a few sort of "milestone" Smokey Sagas...I don't know why I'm saying "we," since I've always written and edited these on my own. But some of you've been "with" me a good couple years, and please don't think I haven't noticed. For a bit, I stopped doing intros. I don't know if they'll come with every story anymore. I also didn't think I needed to keep labeling or numbering them (but in case you're at all curious, you're about to read number 81). And depending on how many of my stories you've read, Beloved Reader, the erotic elements/arc in this story may seem familiar. What can I say; it's one of my favorite scenarios, italic period. You'll probably see it more in the future as well. There is a bit of a twist on it in this story, though. Enjoy.
