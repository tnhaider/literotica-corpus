 Ali and I had flown into the Twin Cities together; I was here for my monthly visit with my staff, and for meetings with Teri, my operations manager. Ali had a meeting at one of the companies, on whose board, she held a seat.

The long distance management of my firm was working just as I had planned. Teri's on-site presence was a huge factor, no doubt about it, but thanks to computers, on-line conferencing, and the like, I was able to keep my hand firmly on the tiller.

When we left New Orleans, our renovations for the gallery were underway; we hired a contractor recommended by Sharon's dad, a contractor that his real estate firm uses. 

It was a good choice Ali and I agreed; fifteen minutes into our initial meeting, the three of us were finishing each other's sentences when talking about our vision of the changes we wanted to make.

It's good to be on the same page with others.

"Want to grab a bite to eat before we go to the condo?" I asked of Ali, driving us from the rental car lot at the airport.

"I could eat, I guess, but I'm not really all that hungry," Ali answered me.

"Okay, I can wait but not too much longer," grinning at her.

"Why don't we call Teri and Nat and have them join us for dinner," her eyes on me, questioningly.

Picking up my cell phone, I placed the call.
