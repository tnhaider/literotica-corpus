 A/N: Another story featuring submissive Sarah and her Mistress, Rebecca, from my earlier stories "The 14th Anniversary", "My beautiful Sub" and "Choosing Corner Time". It takes place a few weeks after Sarah received her permanent collar from her Mistress, about seven months after their first meeting.

Note on the timeline. "The 14th anniversary" and "My beautiful sub" take place on Valentine's Day 2011, the first story recalls things that happened on Valentine's Day 1997 and a few days, later. "Choosing Corner time" depicts the dynamic of Sarah's and Rebecca's relationship a couple of years after their beginning. "Sarah Acts Out" is also set in the first year of their time together, about two months after Sarah received her permanent Platinum collar from Rebecca. Sooner or later there will also be a longer story dealing with Sarah's training, but that still has to be finished, at the moment I'm considering posting another Victoria and Jacqueline story first. 

Summary: Sarah misbehaves in public and is called to order and disciplined by her stern and loving Mistress.
