 Author notes

You can skip to the story. This is all vanity stuff.

This twisted tale is a Harlequin Romance on steroids, or perhaps, on aphrodisiacs.

The next submission of this novella completes the story, but this portion stands on its own. If time is friendly, part two will find Literotica within two weeks. It's finished and needs the edits of grammar friends.

Thanks to the efforts of beta buddies, a queer young woman's small fingers found yellow crinkled paper and then a computer. 

SexyLatina19 helped her think things through, and the two fell in love. She feels Noira is officially the Venus of beta readers, and pretty coolio to boot. I have it on good authority, the strange author is ready to run nekky on the freeway for both of them this evening. She hopes they chase her.

A couple of people helped her with grammar. She did much of the grammar herself because she's trying to learn. She hates to mention the folks who helped her due to all of the remaining errors. They're her fault (she's hard headed).

Queer young woman found exciting words to scribble on yellow crinkled paper thanks to all of you. Uhm, something tells me she is extremely grateful. I simply know these things.

Plot builds before sex, but the sex is ribald, tawdry, and hot. This young woman works hard and does not hold orgasmic lesbian frenzy from the inevitable, so she insists you enjoy.

The queer young woman told me so.
