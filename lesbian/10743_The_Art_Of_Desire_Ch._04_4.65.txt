 Cold and hunger finally drove Meaghan and Sam to collect themselves. The truck rumbled quietly as Sam turned on the defrost, waiting for the windows to clear. Meaghan awkwardly slid back into her jeans and pulled her shoes into place before scooting toward Sam for a kiss. Their eyes met a long moment, then they kissed once more. "We really need to get back," Meaghan said in a rough whisper that was met by Sam's nod. Meaghan ran a hand over Sam's forehead, pushing back the stray hairs. "I meant what I said. All of it." Again, Sam nodded.

Meaghan's smile wavered, then strengthened. She leaned in for a last kiss, then slid toward the passenger side door and out. Sam jumped a little when the door closed, then sat silently as Meaghan started her own car, buckled in, and drove away.

It hurt to swallow as Sam looked away from the rearview mirror. She turned on the windshield wipers, then waited for the glass to clear a little more while she slowly drew her own seatbelt across herself. The cab smelled like Meaghan. Like her shampoo and her lavender soap, and like that scent that was simply Meaghan. Sam fought back tears again, but the urge was no longer as strong, just the lingering dredges of emotion.

Would they be okay? Sam wasn't used to making herself so vulnerable, and she still wasn't entirely over that first feeling of terror when Charles walked in on her in the shower.

But to be loved? Truly loved? All Samantha's lovers until now had been flings of one sort or another, some deeper, some purely physical with no substance. This felt so different. Like so much more. It shook her to the core.

She blinked as the wipers came to life again, breaking her train of thought. She sent a text to her brother telling him she was fine but staying home for the day. She knew he wouldn't ask for details, which was good. Sam had no idea what she might say, anyway.
