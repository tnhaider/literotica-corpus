 Alice told me that she played golf. Alice didn't tell me that she was conference champion three years in a row, when in college, and that she had 'flirted' with the junior circuit of the LPGA; No, Alice forgot to mention that little ditty, the bitch!

We played at her club, a beautiful tree-lined course with trees hundreds of years old, Spanish moss draping from some of the limbs. She shot a two over par round and I shot, what I felt was, a respectable 10 over. 

It was a fun round and we'd be back later in the week for a match with some of her friends; a friendly match, for drinks afterwards.
