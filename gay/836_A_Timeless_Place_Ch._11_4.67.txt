 Jonathan moved down the corridor from his uncle's office/bedroom. Greg had slipped his pants back on and quickly caught up to him.

"Jonathan, please don't be angry with me. I just..."

"Greg, I have never imagined my uncle being with me while I was engaged with any of you! The only time that has happened was at the club with Bruce. I haven't done it since, and I don't understand why you guys think I would do that!" his emotion was expressed clearly to the doctor as he lifted his arms away from his sides while he spoke.

"Okay, Jonathan. It's ok. We just want to know that when you're with us, it's us you're with." The man coiled to think for a moment of what he had just said.

Jonathan grinned at him, his point clearly taken for what it meant. But he could tell that Greg wasn't sure it had come out the way he wanted it to. "I understand what you're saying, Greg. And I promise that is not the case." He affirmed.

"Good...Now...Can we finish what we started?" the expression on the man's face almost made Jonathan laugh. It was apparent he absolutely wanted him.

"Well, I thought we would meander down to your room and see what's cookin' there." Jonathan eased an arm around the man slowly beginning to lead him in that direction.

"Jonathan, you're such a tease." Greg's face broke into a broad grin.
