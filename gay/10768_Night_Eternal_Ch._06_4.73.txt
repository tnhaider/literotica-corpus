Chapter 6: Ryan and Coby Forever

_____________________

Coby

My happiness must have been evident as I was walking out of the Archon's mansion, because I got the strangest looks from the other Vampires milling about. I didn't care. After six months I was finally going to be reunited with Ryan. I had planning to do. I didn't want to rush into it without having everything prepared. Over the next week, I completely rearranged my room and had one of my spare rooms made up just in case Ryan wanted a place to himself. I had hoped he would stay with me, in my bed, but I planned for every possibility. I had gotten Ryan a few pieces of new clothing. I had planned on taking him out after for a completely new wardrobe, but in the meantime this would do. 

I had John and Alice hopping, cleaning up the apartment and making sure everything was in order.

"This guy must really mean a lot to you," John asked.

"Yea John, he does. More than I ever realized, but just remember you were my first guy." I gave him one of my most brilliant smiles. He started to blush a bit. 

Finally, the night had arrived. All the preparations had been made. I had been to see Pete the night before and told him that he could go out tonight and leave Ryan alone because he should be okay for one night. I had snuck into the house right after Pete left under a cloak. I went in and planted a suggestion in Ryan to take a walk to the park to clear his head. He didn't see me of course, so to him it seemed as if he had just decided to get out of the house for a while. I wanted to make sure that people saw him leave.

I had been in my wolf form before when I had wanted to watch him up close, but tonight I didn't care if he saw me. I was sitting across the street when he came out of his apartment. He stopped and stared at me for a minute. Then he started walking down the street. I ran down back alleys to get ahead of him, just to make sure he was headed in the right direction and that no street thug was waiting to mug him. 

As we entered the park I realized he must have gotten paranoid about me following him, because he started looking around like he was getting ready for something to strike him at any moment. I decided that we were far enough in the park for what I wanted to do, so I walked into some bushes and changed back to human form. I used a little speed boost to move behind him as he had turned around and had almost seen me walk into the bushes.

When he turned around, he just stared at me. It was then that I realized I had changed a lot in the last six months. I had bulked up quite a bit and my hair was a lot longer. I grinned and gave him a hint. "What! No hello?" 

The light bulb came on quick. The shock on his face almost made me laugh, "C…Coby? …How… Where have you been?" 

I couldn't wait any longer. I had to have him in my arms right then and there. "I'll explain everything, but first." I walked up to him and wrapped my arms around him. I could feel tears welling up in my eyes. I had waited so long for this. I knew from the moment he embraced me that I was making the right decision for both of us. I could see his aura radiating the love he had for me, he began sobbing uncontrollably, his tears mixing with mine on both of our cheeks. "Oh God, I've missed you!" I whispered in his ear. 

He whispered back, "What happened? Where have you been? Why haven't you called me? We all have been worried sick over you… I… I don't care! I missed you bro, more than I ever thought I would. I'm just glad you're back home." I pulled away slowly. This was the moment! I had two choices, either do it now or say goodbye forever.

"I'm sorry Ryan. I didn't come back to stay. I had to come back, because I left something behind, something that means the world to me." As I spoke those words, the look on his face went from disappointment to absolute horror. His aura shifted to an absolute dark purple of terror, the love just barely fringing the outside of his aura. I could see it in his eyes too, I was right! He had truly felt as I had, that we had really missed out on what could have been. All those years and we never realized how much we meant to each other until this moment, in the middle of some city park!

"What do you mean? You can't do this to me! I've been lost without you and there is so much we need to talk about." I could not wait any longer. He had even confirmed Chris's suspicions about us! We were meant for each other, in every way!

I know my face must have been beaming. He had made me the happiest man in the world. I pumped up my speed and moved around behind him. To him I had just disappeared. As he was desperately looking around for me, I slowly moved up and placed my right hand around his waist. Then, I draped my left arm over his shoulder and placed my palm on his heaving chest and pulled him close. I leaned in over his right shoulder. I was so aroused by this, I'm sure my cock was pressing against his ass. I whispered in his ear, "I came back for you!" 

I then sunk my fangs into his neck. The love I had for Ryan made the experience all the more sensuous. He began to moan as I fed from him. I began to remember the first time I had gone through this. I never wanted it to stop. Once I had drained him completely I almost cried as I held his lifeless form in my arms. He had just taken his final breath. I bit my wrist as I laid him gently on the ground. Here came the moment of truth.
