 Jonathan couldn't hear the interaction, and wondered what the man was saying to the doctor. He imagined it had something to do with him, the way the nurse was looking at him. It made him tingle all over. His mind became a swirl of images of the three of them together immersed in carnal desires.

He couldn't help but vision the two of them taking such advantage of him. And perhaps Tony could help the doctor come out of himself a little. 

The thought of him barking orders at him, coming short of forcing him to do his bidding gave him a most sensationally erotic feeling. And he could tell just by the way Tony acted that he was one to take charge of matters right away.

"I'll be right back..." Tony spoke softly, drawing Jonathan out of his fantastical imaginings. He disappeared into the bathroom for a moment. Returning with a warm damp cloth, he now cleaned the doctor with gently. 

Still eyeing the youth that was now watching his every move, he smiled at him mischievously. "You're very curious about me now, huh?" The man almost whispered to Jonathan.

The youth nodded.

"I'll bet you're curious about the two of us, huh?" The man asked in the same way.

Another nod...

"I'll tell you all about it soon." Tony smiled wickedly again. "As for me, I'm very curious about you. I've heard so much about you. But I'd rather see for myself." The man informed him as he tossed the washcloth in a cloth bag on a metal frame nearby.

Greg fixed himself once again, then moved around the bed checking Jonathan's stomach matter. "I think we can remove this now." he told the man.

"Let me wash my hands." Tony rushed into the bathroom returning soon after.

When the man returned Greg deflated the balloon.

"Relax, Jonathan." Tony ordered gently.

The two men began to pull the tube out of Jonathan's throat slowly. The youth gagged several times before the plastic contraption was free of his gullet. He coughed taking a deep breath once it was completely free. 

"There, now..." Greg smiled down at the youth.

"That feels better." Jonathan's voice was a bit hoarse.

"It talks..." Tony teased, acting completely surprised by the fact.

"Of course it does..." Jonathan looked at him with a bit of disdain.

"Ooh, it also has an attitude." the man jested.

Greg chuckled. "That he does." He stated playfully.

"Can we put this back in?" Tony teased, then laughed.

"You wouldn't dare?" Jonathan groaned.

"Oh, don't push me, Jonathan." Tony warned with a wicked grin.

"You see, I found you someone with some of your own personality traits." Greg teased. "You guys should get along quite well." the man laughed.

"Greg, you're funny." Jonathan laughed.

"Glad you noticed, Babe. I gotta go check my other patients. Oh, guess what..." he started to turn away, but returned to the spot he had been standing. "The administrator is givin' me a break. He said I could take the rest of my vacation when you get outta the hospital. So the time I'm working now won't count against it."

"That's great..." Jonathan was emphatic.

"I knew you'd see it that way." The man left the room, leaving Jonathan alone with Tony.

Jonathan looked over at the man standing to his left again. He was tall... His hair was dark and long, which he tied into a ponytail with several thick black elastics at even intervals down his back. The eyes were large dark mysterious almonds, surrounded by thick dark lashes and thick trimmed eyebrows. His nose was average and rounded. The lips full and turned up in a wicked grin at the moment. The man's jaw seemed squared. His chin curved gently. Th cheeks were high suggesting he be of foreign origin. 

His skin was darkly tanned, smooth and unblemished... His shoulders broad and strong... The arms and chest seemed to be sculpted with muscles. His waist was trim. Jonathan couldn't see the man thighs or any thing else, so it was left to his imagination. Which he took hold of with a run at the thought.

"Are you done undressing me with your eyes now?" Tony almost whispered, as Jonathan's eyes came back up to the man's face.

The youth began to breathe somewhat differently. "I wasn't undressing you. I was looking you over. Are you Native American?" He asked to draw the man's conversation elsewhere.

"No... I'm Italian." The man returned.

"Oh... I'm Native--"

"Yes, I figured that." Tony interrupted. "I intimidate you, don't I?" He seemed to be toying with the youth's senses.

"Yes... You are very imposing. But you like to be that way." Jonathan spoke very softly.

"Yes, I do. It gives me a sensual satisfaction." His salacious grin gave no mistaking what he was thinking. "It turns me on." The man clarified with the last statement.

"I'm not an idiot. I understood you the first time." Jonathan's eyes narrowed as he spoke.

The man breathed in heavily. "You know I like you. You have spirit. You don't like being intimidated."

"No, I don't..." Jonathan returned quite frankly.

"Your Uncle intimidates you." Tony stared at the youth seriously.

"And I hate him for it." Jonathan growled through clinched teeth.

"From what I hear you have every reason to hate him. He raped you?" Tony was now following through with his teachings from the classes he was taking. He wanted to go on to something more valuable. His life as a nurse was now coming to an end. Psychiatry was what he truly wanted to go into.

"Yes..." Jonathan answered simply looking away.

Tony studied his responses intently. "More than once, I imagine." He dug deeper now.

"Yes. So what else did Greg tell you?"

"Dr. Carroll, told me that you are very confused... And very afraid." Tony appeared to be more sympathetic now.

"I am... So, what's new..." the youth almost seemed to brush the man off with his statement. "I know he wants to kill me. I got him into trouble."

"Ah, yes... I heard about that too. You told the police what he was doin' to ya. They let 'im go. And yer runnin' scared." Tony grinned now.

"It's not funny..." Jonathan barked.

"I agree... But there comes a time in life when one must face their fears, child. You say you hate being intimidated, yet you allow him to continue to do that. When will it stop? You will never find peace, babe. Not like this." Tony's expression turned to seriousness. "I will teach you if you like. We can work together. But I won't be easy on you. Your time is very short. If not over. He will come for you. Will you be ready?"

"Who are you?" Jonathan looked him over again, as if he might recognize him from home.

"I'm a friend... That's all... You don't have to like me. But I would advise you to listen and do everything I tell you." Tony leaned down close to say.

Jonathan tried to move away from the man. He grabbed at short quick snatches of air. His body tingled with fear.

Tony breathed in deeply. "Ah, you're such a turn on, Jonathan. God, you're so scared of me." He chuckled. "Let me touch you, Babe... One day soon... Let me touch you. I want to revel in the chase for now."

"You're a freak..." Jonathan groaned.

"No, I'm just a man who likes to play a little. Like the lion with his prey. I like to tease, and I like to be teased." He leaned closer. "I'll tell you a secret..." his lips played into a most satisfactory grin. "The more afraid you are or act like you are, the more it turns me on."

The youth lay there thinking of all the things this man could do to him. Some could be very painful. The man was strong and obviously cut. Then some could be very exciting, drawing him to instant release. But again, he only could trust the man knowing Greg and Bruce already did. He felt that strange allure, drawing him to Tony so easily, it was frightening.

"Have you ever been raped?" Jonathan whispered to him harshly. His breathing was so very erratic now.

"No... I can't say that I have." Tony returned looking directly into his fearful face.

"That was the most frightening experience in my life." Jonathan barely could say for breathing so hard.

"What are you sayin'? You want me to rape you?" Tony was somewhat shocked.

"I'm saying, I like to role play. But I think you could make it seem so very real." Jonathan informed him.

"Ah..." Tony grinned an evil grin. "We are exchanging secrets now. Very interesting indeed."

"Can I..." Jonathan moved away some more, acting as though he was so very afraid of this man. Which, in a way he was, but he didn't want him to know that.

"Can you what, Jonathan?" Tony's manhood was throbbing so badly, he thought he would explode soon. Jonathan was so very sweet to him. His responses were so very stimulating. He had never felt this way with anyone else before. It seemed if he only touched himself just once, he would come right then.

"Can I..." Jonathan swallowed hard for the man. "Touch you?" He stuttered.

Tony laughed lightly. "Curiosity killin' ya?"

"Yeah..." Jonathan breathed.

"No... Wait... Make it more interesting." the man stated quickly.

"You like torturing yourself don't you?"

"Yes, I do..."

"Do you like to be tortured? Painfully, I mean?"

Tony stared at him strangely. "I'm not sure if I want to answer that." The man's tone was low and almost inaudible because of the nature of their conversation.

"I like to be beaten." Jonathan now informed him.

"Ah..." Tony realized. "Still trading secrets are we? How do you like to be beaten?"

Jonathan swallowed hard again still keeping up the little game he was playing, to stimulate the man further. "I like to be tied down and beaten. With a belt or somethin' like that."

"Did your Uncle used to do this to you?"

"Yes..."

"What other little torture secrets do you have?" The man ventured.

"Ah, ah... You next..." Jonathan almost grinned at the man.

Tony chuckled. He moved his arms folding them on the railing. When he moved Jonathan bolted suddenly gasping.

"God, kid... Yer gonna make me come any minute." Tony breathed.

The youth couldn't help but smile now.

"Yer a teaser... Yer teasin' me..." The man realized.

"You said you liked bein' teased." Jonathan reminded him.

"And I do... Very much so... You just keep teasin' me, baby. I'm enjoyin' every minute of it." Tony confessed. "To answer yer question, I like to have hot wax poured on me, quickly followed by ice cold water."

"That sounds like it hurts."

"If the partner does it right the pain only lasts for a second or two. But it's enough to stimulate me very highly." Tony admitted.

"What else do you like?" Jonathan probed forgetting the game as Tony had done.

"Ah... You next." The man reminded.

"Oh..." He thought for a moment.

"Come on... You know what you like. And I won't think you're strange. I expect to hear some very different things from you."

"Okay... I like to be caught by the throat during sex." Jonathan challenged his calmness.

"Strangulation, caught by the throat?" Tony asked simply.

"Yes... Very tight... 'Till I almost pass out. I like to be kissed while it's done too."

"Mmm... I would have to be very careful with you. Sometimes I forget how strong I am. I could snap your neck before you knew it and not mean to do it." The man informed him.

Jonathan breathed wildly at hearing this. "I guess we'd have to be very careful then."

"Yes..." The man stared into his widened eyes. "I like to be clawed while making love." He informed the youth.

"Like when your partner is coming?"

"Yes..."

"I like the fear factor. Anything violent."

"Be specific..."

"Like out of nowhere someone comes up behind me. They grab me and pin me against the wall by the throat... They kiss me... They're rough with me. Then they fuck me." He described.

"Hmm...I got a whole fantasy that time. We're making progress." The man grinned. "I like playing the sadistic lover... Mean, unmerciful, master type."

Jonathan sucked in air suddenly at hearing this. "I love to do that... I mean, have it done to me."

"I can see that... You almost came when I said it. Tell me more, Jonathan." The man was tired of the game and wanted to know everything about him.

"I like to be tied up. And I mean completely. From my hands and wrists to my ankles." Jonathan volunteered.

"What else..."

"Your turn..."

The man grabbed the youth's hair suddenly in his fists. "I said what else..." The man groaned.

Jonathan gasped, as the man reached for him grabbing his hair. His body surged with sudden stimulation. He held his breath fighting an orgasm.

"I like to be naked and fucked while my partner is still fully dressed." He whispered.

The man half-chuckled. "Go on..."

"I like to be beaten with things other than a belt."

"Like what?"

"Hangers, wires, things that draw blood."

"More..."

"I like to be threatened during sex."

"More..."

"I like the way you scare the shit outta me."

"More..."

"I want you to touch me."

The man stared at him long. His lips played into a grin. "No... Later... Tell me more..."

"I can't think of anything else to tell you."

"Oh, there's more. You just don't want to tell me."

"No, I mean it... I can't think of anything else."

"You're lying..." The man growled low.

"When I'm beaten sometimes, I come."

"There it is... That's what I was lookin' for. Why did it take so long for you to tell me?"

"I was afraid you'd think I was lying."

"No... I'm the same way... So, is Greg..." Tony informed him. "We've been seeing each other for several years now. We both like it the same ways. So, we do each other the way we like it."

"What about, Bruce?"

"Him too... But he's more the lovin' type. He likes touchy feely things. But he'll come out when he has to." Tony informed him.

"So, all of you get together sometimes?"

Yeah. We do. When the mood strikes us. Been thinkin' 'bout movin' in with each other."

"I think you all should." Jonathan stated.

"I still think there's more to you than what you're tellin' me. You like bein' molested in yer sleep, don't you?"

"Yeah, but how did you know?"

"You like to have yer clothes ripped off."

"Yeah..."

"You like being threatened with knives and weapons."

"Yeah..."

"You like to cut yourself when yer alone."

Jonathan stared at him blankly.

"You fuck yerself with objects that hurt you."

He couldn't believe the man was reading him so well.

"You beat yerself when nobody else will. You've used drugs in the past. You were prostituted by yer Uncle."

"Who the fuck are you?" Jonathan tried to get away from him.

"Hey... Settle down..." Tony grabbed the youth's shoulders pinning him down. "Calm down now. I'm not gonna hurtchya." The man stated softly.

"I know you... I wish I could remember who you are. You ain't been workin' here the last ten years." Jonathan stared at him. Fear coursing through him wildly.

"Oh, yes I have... I can prove it." The man stated.

"It can be faked..."

"Smart kid... But it's true... The people here can tell you I've been here that long." Tony reasoned. "Then who are you? Why do I know you? Why can't I remember yer name?" The youth thought out loud.

"It'll come to ya. I'm sure of it." The man smiled gently.

"Then I do know you!" Jonathan was breathing even wilder now.

"If you say so..." Tony continued to elude him.

Greg came into the room seeing the two staring each other down. "Am I interrupting somethin'?" He asked.

"Not really, Doc... He's tryin' to remember how he knows me." Tony informed him.

"Oh... Did'e figure it out yet?" Greg asked.

"Not yet..." The man answered seriously.

"Hmp... It'll come to 'im..." Greg smiled.

"He's been workin' here the last ten years?" Jonathan asked.

"Yeah... Except on his vacations. He wasn't workin' here durin' those times." The man answered approaching the bed slowly.

"What are you sayin'?" Jonathan asked. "You know I know him? Who is he?" The youth demanded to know.

"Jonathan... Do I need to sedate you?" Greg asked now. "You seem a little delusional."

"Don't play games with me!" Jonathan groaned. "Tell me what you know!"

"I don't know anything, Jonathan." the doctor replied looking down at the youth.

He adjusted the machine, to make the youth go back to sleep for a while. It wasn't that he didn't want to tell the youth. He just didn't think the kid would be too agreeable to the situation at hand. His only mission was to keep the teen safe. And who better to do it than the one person he knew would know what Jonathan's Uncle would do and how he would do it.

Jonathan fought the sleep that was overcoming him. He no longer trusted these men. Fear coursed through him that they were planning to hand him over to his Uncle as soon as he showed up. They had probably called him and he was on his way there now. But the medicine was much too strong for him. He closed his eyes quickly pretending to be asleep. He just had to know the truth. 

"You fool..." Greg groaned low at the man.

"He already recognized me. He's a smart kid." Tony returned.

"Now we have a problem. He probably believes we're gonna hand him over to his Uncle...Or worse... How do you suppose we keep him safe now?" Greg barked.

"I'll do my job, Greg. I will not let him be harmed." Tony assured him.

"You had better do your job." Greg stared him in the eyes meanly. "If you loose him, I swear--"

"I will not loose him, Greg." Tony was firm. "I hate that man as much or more than he does." He growled low pointing at the youth. "I will not let him take him. He'll have to kill me first." He expressed strongly. "I told you I knew what he was doin' to the kid. I just never had the evidence to lock 'im up."

"Well, if we play our cards right, you'll get that chance." Greg returned calming then.

"I can't wait..." Tony moved to the left of Jonathan checking his urine bag again.

Jonathan listened intently though he felt so very groggy. They were on his side. He had misjudged them. But who the hell was Tony? How did he know him? He let the drug take him down to a deep sleep. His last thought was the question burning in his soul.

Jonathan was walking to school as he did everyday. Though the sky was bright and beautiful above him he never knew it. His head hanging low he slowly meandered down the sidewalk toward school. It no longer mattered to him if he was on time or not. Though he knew he would be in so much trouble if he was late, he still drug around wishing he lived somewhere else, with someone else.

Just then a rugged old light blue pick up grumbled up beside him. "Hey, kid..." the dark skinned man smiled at him. 

"Hey..." Jonathan answered solemnly.

"You look like you need a friend. Wanna talk?" The man asked.

Jonathan shrugged.

"Come on, kid. I'll drive ya over to school. We can talk." he opened the passenger door.

"How do I know yer not gonna kidnap me and kill me?" Jonathan asked then.

"I guess that's a chance you'll have to take." he returned.

Jonathan thought about it a moment. If he did kidnap him and kill him it would end the hell he was living in now. He moved to the truck getting in, closing the door. The man smiled at him gently. 

"So what gives?" The man asked.

"I don't know." The youth shrugged.

"Name's Tony. What's yer's?" He asked.

"Jonathan..."

"Got any brothers and sisters?"

"No..." Jonathan was so solemn.

"What does yer dad do?"

"My dad's dead. So is my mom."

"Jonathan, I'm so sorry." The man slipped his arm on the back of the seat. He moved closer to him.

"What do you want from me?" Jonathan asked then.

"How old are you, Jonathan?"

"Fourteen..." The youth stated.

"Jonathan. Who are you livin' with?"

"My Uncle..."

"Is he good to you?"

Jonathan looked at him long. He fought the tears that threatened to spill out onto his face.

"Is he hurtin' you?" The man pressed. "Someone said they heard you screamin' last night. They said you scream every night. Is he hurting you somehow?"
