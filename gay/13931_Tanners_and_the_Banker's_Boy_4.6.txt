"Wash up, lazybones, and take those furs to Sir Charles," the tanner ordered. The day's chill turned his breath to a liquor-laden mist.

"Sir Charles, Father?" Tanners asked, confused.

The tanner rolled his eyes to the heavens. "Oh ye gods, why curse me with such a stupid boy?" He turned to the young man. "The banker, the one whose son you don't like. He's offered three gold for the lot."

Tanners scowled. "Everyone follows him like sheep. He calls me names that I don't understand. He never has a kind word for me."

"The boy? No reason why he should," his father riposted with a belch, "but it's neither the master you'll be seeing nor his sly serpent of a son. Speak to the steward so you don't offend the household, and don't come back without my coin. Do you think your thick head can handle it?"

"Yes, Father."

"Good. Be on your best behavior. Should you encounter Charles the Younger, stay clear of his path."
