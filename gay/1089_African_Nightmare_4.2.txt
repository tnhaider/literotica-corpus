 This story takes place in Nigeria. The year is 1968 and the country was in the midst of civil war. The Ibo's, a tribe that lived in the eastern region on Nigeria had broken away following the assassination of the Nigerian Premier. The Ibo's called their territory Biafra and as this area contained Nigeria's oil reserves tensions were running high. In the north of the country Fiat the giant Italian car and engineering company were building a dam on the river Niger. It is in this area my story unfolds. This is mainly a work of fiction but it is based on actual events that occurred!
