 From the holes in the crate I saw a flag. I was in Texas. I had learned that the plane was a Company plane. It was full of slaves in crates all around me. The conversations we had were enlightening. 

Female slaves tended to hate service completely I heard from them it was because many were prostituted. There was only one female on that flight that truly loved her new Master. Over 40% of the male slaves had fallen in line with their new life. The plane had landed 6 times. By the the time I ended up in Texas, only the Mexican bound slaves were still on board. They were all disgruntled female slaves. 

My crate was off loaded and I was put onto the back of a truck. It was a plain Ford truck. The airstrip wasn't close to any city or town I could see. I could hear crying from the plane, as the forklift placed me in the truck bed. 

I knew that this "incognito" travel arrangement was needed, and thankfully, almost over. I still found it a bit ridiculous. I was down to one last bottle of water. I needed to urinate badly. I focused on my mission, trying to forget my bladder.
