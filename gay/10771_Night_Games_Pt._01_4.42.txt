 It had been a grey, dreary Saturday. Snow had been falling almost as fast as the temperatures. The entire city was shut down. It was quiet except for the occasional scraping of a snowplow's blade along the street.

It was the first Saturday I had off in a long while. In fact I had the entire weekend off and had no idea what I was going to do with myself. 

Well, i had one idea but figured jerking off the entire weekend might leave me a little weak for the upcoming work week.

I was in between relationships so there was no one to go anywhere with or do anything with so I decided to just stay in and have a day all to myself. 

I hadn't changed out of my pajama bottoms and was wearing an old t-shirt. I lit a fire in the living room fireplace and chilled out, fully preparing to shut down my body and brain.

The day went as I planned. I watched movies, ate foods that weren't good for me and watched the snow fall, and, yeah, jerked off after breakfast.

Just as I about to call it a day, somewhere right before 12 A.M., my doorbell rang. 

Which was odd not only because of the hour but because there was almost a foot and a half of snow on the ground. 

You'd have to be crazy to be out on a night like this, I thought.

I was the only tenant in the building. The floor below me was empty. The second floor only had one commercial occupant and they closed at 5 and weren't open on weekends. The tenant on the first floor was open on weekends but with the weather as bad as it was, they hadn't bothered to open. Basically, I had this big building to myself. 

I walked over to the living room window and peered down to the front stoop four stories below. I recognized one of the two faces staring back up at me immediately. 

It was my best friend from high school.

He looked up at me and smiled. 

**FLASHBACK**

I had just graduated from high school. My best friend of five years had invited me over to watch movies. His sister and mother were going to be out of town for six days and he wanted to celebrate his freedom with a guy's night. It would be a marathon of horror and sci-fi movies, pizza and beer, he said. Sounded like a fun evening. 

And it was. We did the typical guy thing. We drank some beers and watched crappy movies with girls with big tits getting killed by guys in a masks. We ordered pizzas and raided the fridge. 

Late, late in the evening, when we had bored with aliens and swamp monsters, we decided to just talk. 

Miles was on the couch and I was in a recliner. We were separated by a coffee table covered in beer bottles and pizza boxes. We were just in our underwear and t-shirts. Our pants and sneakers were somewhere but didn't really care at the moment. 

I preferred boxers and Miles liked bikini style. 

Miles had the body for bikini briefs. He'd been a dancer all his life and his body was muscular and toned. I would have killed to have had his abs. 

Deep into our conversation, Miles got a serious look on his face. He leaned forward and put his beer on the coffee table. Then he asked me a question.

"What's your wildest sexual fantasy?"

I must have had a look on my face because he said, "Tell me yours and I will tell you mine."

I thought for a minute, took a swig of beer and told him that I had this sorta-crush on one of the cheerleaders. I described how I thought her pigtails and short skirt were sexy and I wanted to fuck her and blah blah blah boring 18 year old guy fantasy. 

He nodded and said, "Yeah, that could be hot." 

He took a swig of beer.

"So...spill it. What's your's?" I asked.

Miles surprised me when he shared his ultimate sexual fantasy. 

"I want to be in a room with a group of people," he said with a mischievous look on his face.

"All kinds of people. Women...men...black...white. All types. There's music playing and we are all just exploring each other's bodies in this big pile of sex and lust."

I felt a butterfly in my stomach. I felt my cock twitch. I put a hand over my crotch.

"Just a big pile of naked people all feeling each other up?"

He nodded yes. 

"So...what if," I continued, "While you were exploring this sex pile, rolling around, bumping into naked people, you came face to face with another guy?...a naked guy?" I asked.

"Another guy? Another naked guy?," he mocked, "I dunno. I guess I would do what came naturally," he responded.

I noticed his hand had gone to the growing lump in his bikini briefs. He gave it a squeeze and it seemed to swell. Or maybe that was just a mirage created by my imagination, the beer and the late hour.

Miles continued, "If I rolled over and was face to face with another naked guy and he wanted to kiss me. I'd let him."

Gulp.

"And if he wanted to suck my cock, I guess I'd let him."

That would be natural? I thought. Hold the phone. Was my best friend telling me he was gay and would suck another guy's cock? 

Miles put his beer to his mouth and let it sit there for a minute. Then he slid his lips over the top. He had a look in his eyes. He stared at me. He took a swig and put the beer back on the table. Then he added, "And if he wanted me to suck his cock, I would."

I swallowed hard and tried to hide my growing erection. 

"You'd suck his cock?" I asked.

"Or let him fuck me. Yes. What ever-"

"Felt natural," I finished. 

My mind was racing, "Are you gay, Miles?" I asked.

"I don't know," he replied, "I guess you could say I'm curious."

His briefs were now tented, straining against the material of his tight bikini briefs. His cock was at full attention and he didn't mind I knew it. In fact he pivoted his body so that he was facing me straight on, his cock aimed directly at me.

The head of my cock poked from out of my boxers through the fly. 

Guess the cat was out of the bag. 

"Like, now, for instance," he said sitting up, "You're hard and I'm hard and we're both aching for some kind of relief. Why does that relief have to be shooting our loads into a wet towel or into the toilet?"

He pulled the waistband of his briefs down and the head of his cock lay across his belly. It was a purplish pink and it was shiny with precum. There were thick veins running up the shaft. He gripped it in his hand and gave it a pump in my direction. 

My balls twitched.

"Why can't we help each other out. Lend each other a hand, as it were."

I was speechless. 

"Because if you wanted me to suck your cock, I would."

He sat up and nodded towards the space next to him on the couch.

"If you wanted to suck mine, I'd let you."

I sat up, the recliner springing back into an upright position. 

There was a lot of upright things in the room at the moment.

"Do you?" Do you want me to suck your cock, Wyatt?"

"Yes," I whispered. 

"Do you want to suck my cock?"

I looked at it. I was mesmerized by it's girth and length. Something in my brain told me I wanted to...needed to taste it...feel it in my mouth. 

I nodded yes.

I got up and walked over to him. He swiveled his body around and I stepped in between his muscular thighs. He reached out and slid his fingers into the waistband of my boxers. The touch of his fingers against my skin made me shiver. Trust me. In a good way. 

He slowly pulled them down, never taking his eyes off of mine. When I felt the material of my boxers on top of my feet, I stepped out of them and kicked them to the side. 

I was now naked in front of my best friend who was sporting a very healthy erection. 

Miles smiled at me and then leaned forward and kissed the head of my cock. Somewhere, I don't know if it was a place in my head or body or cock, or everywhere, a switch inside me flipped. 

He pressed his thick lips against my mushroom head and slid them down until the entire tip of my cock was in his mouth. He sucked gently. He pulled off and kissed it. He licked at my dripping slit and then slid back down over the entire head.

He pulled off and took my hand. He wanted me next to him. He wanted me closer. I sat down and his hand went to my cock. Mine went to his. He leaned in to kiss me. I let him. 

I slid his briefs down and gripped the steel pole between his legs. 

Then we lay together on that couch. Our hands exploring our bodies. I kissed him and he kissed me back. We French kissed, our tongues circling each other. I could feel our cocks touching. 

Wonder Twins Power ACTIVATE!

We stood facing each other. Miles knelt down in front of me and returned to my cock. He lowered his lips down over the mushroom tip and I felt hot, moist heat engulf it. He pushed forward, dragging his tongue across my slit. His hand gripped the shaft and he pumped me a few times. I moaned in response.

I'm not sure if mine was the first cock Miles had sucked but he sure knew what he was doing. He slid back and forth, kissing and licking as he worked my cock.

His hands went around and grabbed my ass. He squeezed my cheeks as he pulled me to him, pushing my whole cock into his throat. 

I had my cock sucked before. Never like this, though, and certainly not by a guy. Miles' knew what he was doing. He was driving me crazy. 

After a few minutes of mind-blowing cock sucking, Miles pulled off of my cock and looked up at me. He smiled. His thick lips were coated with a glaze of precum and spit. 

"Ready to give it a try, Baby?" he asked. 

All I could do was nod yes and kneel before him. 

I could smell the muskiness of his sex just inches from my face. I studied it. I had never seen another guy's cock so up close and personal before. 

The pink, purplish head leaked a large drop of precum. I licked at it and the saltiness surprised me. The shaft was long, about eight inches, and it was thick, covered in veins. His balls hung in fur covered sack. I could feel the weight inside them. 

"Go on, it's okay," Miles encouraged, "It's just you and me."

I took his cock in my hands and felt the heat of it. It twitched when I touched it and my heart skipped a beat. I leaned forward and took the head into my mouth. The tip was velvety and filled my mouth. I wrapped my lips around it and licked it. I sucked gently, trying to remember everything Miles had done to me...for me. 

I felt his hands on my head, pushing me further along his shaft. He was whispering but I couldn't hear him over the voices screaming in my brain.

I opened my throat, gagging a little, but didn't stop. I wanted to do this. I wanted Miles' cock in my mouth. I pulled off of it slowly, teasing him, and then pushed forward again. I got into a nice rhythm. My hands went to his toned, dancer's ass. I grabbed it and gave one cheek a spank. 

I quickened my pace and he told me I was a good student. 

I was sucking his cock now and really getting into it. I licked along the veins on his shaft and flicked my tongue under the tip of his mushroom head. 

Miles' told me to stop. I did. He told me to stand and I did. He took my hand and led me to his bedroom. I followed like an obedient puppy. 

When we got into his room we lay on his bed in a 69 position. I studied his cock before lowering my lips to it. I slid back over the mushroom head and managed to get more of him down my throat.

We both took each other's cock into our mouths at the same time. Whatever he did to me, I did to him. Miles was the teacher. I was the student. 

I was getting better at relaxing my throat and taking more of his amazing black cock. I only choked once. 

Miles was performing magic on mine and I was completely under his power. 

Who would have known I would have surrendered my heterosexuality so easily? Who would have known I was a such a wanton, black cock hungry white boy? 

My guess is Miles had a suspicion. 

I could feel his nose burrowing into the hair around the base of my cock. 

We stopped the mutual cocksucking to explore our naked bodies. 

While our mouths sucked, kissed, nibbled and licked, our hands were everywhere. I felt his muscular body. I squeezed his ass and allowed my hands to slide down between his cheeks. I separated them and he did the same to me. I felt cool air on my lower body which was hovering somewhere around 125 degrees. 

Miles sensed I was close and we returned to our glorious 69. I went at his cock eagerly this time, opening wide and taking in about 4 inches almost instantly. 

Miles was swallowing me and milking me with his talented mouth. We both bobbed up and down, wetting our lips with spit and precum. 

We were both quickening our pace. We were both close. I could feel his cock turn to steel. My balls were aching for release. I knew he was going to cum in my mouth and I wasn't sure how I felt about that. 

I came first. It was a shattering climax and I screamed like some wild animal into the night. Miles kept his mouth clamped down onto my shuddering penis as I shot my load down his throat. 

Just as I was recovering, Miles began to orgasm, sending thick loads of cum into my mouth and down my throat. 

I couldn't handle it all and some leaked out onto my face. I breathed stiffly through my nose as he pushed into me. He groaned and let me nurse his cock until he softened. 

I had just sucked my first cock and I didn't really know how I felt about that. Was I gay? I had to be. Right? Straight guys don't blow their best friends. Do they?

A million thoughts ran through my mind. 

Mostly though I was happy. I felt complete somehow. My best friend was snuggled up next to me, his hand on my cock and I had a load of his cum in my belly. I didn't regret any of it. 

We rearranged ourselves on the bed so we were facing each other. Our bodies dripped sweat and our lips and faces, were glazed with each other's cum. We looked into each other's eyes and then we kissed. Our tongues mingled and I could taste my own cum. He could taste his. Our hands went to each other's ass and we pulled ourselves closer until our cocks began to stir once more.

**END FLASHBACK**

And now here he was, standing in my doorway after midnight with some guy looking at me with those eyes.

"Can we come in?" he asked. 

I opened the door wider, stepped aside, and let them pass me. As Miles stepped past, I breathed in his scent. I remembered it well. 

I followed the two of them into the living room. 

"Were you turning in?"

"Slow night in the bachelor pad," I said. 

"We could go," Miles said, although it was more a question.

"Don't be silly," I chuckled, "The roads are getting treacherous."

Miles hadn't changed. He had a dancer's body and build. He looked great. 

Brandon, his friend, as it turned out, performed at the club the two of the them had just left. 

Brandon was a drag performer. They had met at a dance class apparently. 

Brandon was smaller than Miles and I and had a small, slender build. He was cute and I could see how he could be a drag performer. He looked young though and I wondered what my best friend was doing with him. 

I noticed they were both shivering and I told them to kick off their boots in the foyer while I got some towels. I told them to get out of their wet things and I'd be right back.

As I passed the fireplace, I threw two logs in. 

I gathered two towels, some clothes from my dresser. I walked back to the foyer and found them standing there in just their underwear. Miles still preferred bikini style briefs I noticed. 

Brandon covered himself almost immediately with the large towel I handed him.

"Here put these on," I said, "And get into the living room. The fire is going and should thaw you out a bit."

As they dried off and dressed, I put their wet socks, pants and shirts in the bathroom. The heat in there worked really well and the clothes would be dry in about an hour.

When I came back into the living room, Miles and Brandon were standing in front of the fireplace. I noticed how the glow of the flickering of the flames highlighted Miles' toned, black body. 

Miles was wearing a t-shirt and my Adidas sweats. His flat, muscular stomach shown from under the cut off t-shirt. The sweatpants were tight on him and every line was visible. Every. Line. 

He caught me staring at him and smiled. 

Brandon on the other hand looked like a little kid who'd dressed in their older brother's work out clothes. I couldn't help but laugh. He was certainly a cutie though. He had rolled the waistband of the sweatpants down way below his bellybutton. I could see his flat stomach. Brandon had very little body hair. I wondered if he had shaved his crotch because I didn't see hair, and, as low as his the sweats were rolled, I should have. 

I told them to sit, make themselves comfortable and I would bring them some drinks. 

When I came back I noticed they had sat together on the same couch, all snuggled together.

I sat across from them on the loveseat.

The wood in the fireplace cracked and popped. 

We talked about their evening and their failed attempt to get home. Brandon tired of chitchat and cut right to the chase. 

"So you two knew each other in high school," Brandon asked.

"And a few years before then."

"A hundred years ago," Miles added. 

"Before you were born," I directed to Brandon, "Which was when? I have to ask."

"Don't let this baby face fool you," he said chuckling, "I'm over 18. Promise."

"Speaking of relationships," Miles said, "Did we just miss a young lady leaving?"

"No. There was no young lady," I replied.

"A young boy?" Brandon asked with a smirk.

Miles gave him a slap on the thigh. 

"Don't be a brat," he said sternly, "Or I'll pull you over my lap." 

"No,"I interrupted, "No young boy either. I'm in between relationships right now. Just enjoying the single life."

I studied the both of them. They were hip to hip on the couch. Brandon's hand was resting in Miles' crotch. I imagined lying over Mile's lap, those too-large sweatpants pulled down to his knees, that apple bottom of his raised in the air ready for a good spanking-

I got lost in my thoughts and had to readjust my growing cock. My eyes met Mile's. He glanced down at my hand on my crotch then back to my eyes. He smiled.

"Speaking of relationships," I asked, "How long has this been going on?"

"A few months," Miles said sliding his arm around Brandon and pulling him even closer. Brandon's hand slipped between Miles' thick, muscular thighs. 

"Love at first sight," Brandon said leaning in to kiss Miles. Miles kissed him back, his eyes on me the whole time.

"I just love his big, black cock."

Well, there it was.

Miles laughed nervously. I nearly spat up my beer. 

"But then, you know what I mean," the sassy little twink said, giving me a little I-know-what-you-two-did-back-in-the-day wink.

The elephant in the room had packed his suitcase and run out the front door. 

The next hour or so was filled with war stories from our high school days and Brandon being Brandon. It was also filled with an undeniable sexual tension it would have taken a chainsaw to cut.

Being between girlfriends as I was, I have to admit I was horny. I couldn't blame it on the beer or pot or late hour. There were two attractive men in my apartment, feet away from me, both sporting erections, flirting with each other and with me. 

If Miles and I had been alone in this situation I know we'd probably end up sucking each other off. Maybe even more. 

Brandon was here, though, sitting across from me. I didn't know how to process that. He was definitely sending me signals. He kept rubbing his cock through his, through my, sweatpants. When he wasn't pawing Miles like a kitten in heat, that is. 

Did that mean he was interested in me? In a threesome? Holy shit. Was I? 

It was all getting way too much. I was tired and a lot stoned and little drunk. But, damnit, I was horny as fuck and didn't think excusing myself to go into the bathroom to jerk one out would have been something a good host would do.
