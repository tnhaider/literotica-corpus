 Authors Note:

Hello Everyone, I asked for comments and comments you commented.

JACK and TOBY take place over years in a very short time. Where Jake "The Doc" and Toby took place over a one year. As I told you the first chapter (Chapter 1) was never supposed to exist. BUT it had to be written to find out why Jack started cheating. It turned into its own chapter, and ended at Toby's age of 22. I wanted to start this series with Toby being 24 and continue until he was 29, at which point he was done with Jack and left to Boston. Summing up exactly how fucked-up their relationship was. 

Yes any relationship has its moments where it is the worst or the greatest. There are some relationships built on trust and some built on what Toby says, "Jack continues to come home to me". Sometimes it is a self-esteem issue or an all we have known type of relationship, "So why try for anything else." Some people leave a relationship when things get rough, some are "Pussywhipped" as someone stated in a comment. Some stay because they are forced, some die or are killed before they can leave. Some stay because it is truly LOVE. Sadly, this is true life, not a fairy tale. I could write Jack and Toby differently but I didn't.

I'm showing how a relationship began, continued (for the good and the bad). How it progresses through to the ultimate ending. It will surprise you, writing Jack surprise the hell out of me. Writing Toby the way I did, surprised the FUCK out of me. To the point of saying how did he grow up by Chapter 1 or even Chapter 9 Pre-Boston? But it all turned around, I could see some growth in his character, and now I understand that Jake "The Doc" is Toby's rock out in Boston. Toby just needed solid ground, yes they were both shy in the beginning. But even the Doc needed Toby for a solid footing.

Again, Thank you for reading.

**Jack**

I walked into Toby's apartment for the first time. He told me a few weeks ago not to come over to his parents' house because I wasn't welcome and he was going to move out. I got bitchy and didn't even talk to Toby until Roy stopped coming around.

I didn't even know where Toby lived or worked. When I called him up, my first few calls went to voicemail. When he finally called me back, he told me he was at work and on break. He finally had a daytime job, he'll be working twelve hour days. But again it was during the day, so he would be home at nights.

He told me where he lived and when I walked in, I WAS IN SHOCK. It was a studio apartment, it was so fucking small you couldn't turn around without running into something.

"I know it is small, but Honey, it's what I could afford. You weren't around, I needed to make a decision and get out of my parents' house. You can visit, stay or." I actually saw despair in Toby's eyes. "There's the door. I don't care anymore, Jack."

"Baby, the apartment is great." Of course a huge lie. "Honey." I pushed him down on the couch which must be his bed too because there was no room for one and I straddled his lap. "When was the last time you spoke to your family?" I was holding his face in my hands so he had to look at me.

"Since I moved out." Oh God, I'm selfish but Toby can't live without his family and I know that.

"How long?" Because sadly I know I haven't talk to him for three plus weeks.

"Two weeks, it took me a week to find this place. I was barely getting any sleep working doubles. I was working both jobs. I worked this one from seven to seven, slept for a few hours worked eleven to six, then back at this one from seven to seven. On my breaks I would call different apartment buildings. When I found an opening, I made an appointment to see them in the evenings when I got out at seven."

"Babe you were killing yourself."

"Well, I found this place it was in a decent part of the city, okay rent. So when I could I borrowed my brother's car when everyone was out, I moved my shit and got out. Yeah I don't have much, but it's a start."

"Toby, you have to go home and talk to your parents."

"No, I don't." He tried to get up but I held him down with everything I had in me, holding on to the back on the couch. "Jack let go, so I don't hurt you."

"No Toby." I didn't want him to know I did have some feelings, shit. "Damn it, Toby. I will alienate you from your friends in a heartbeat, do you know why?" He shook his head, no. "Because I would be afraid that you would fuck one of them."

"But I would never alienate you from your family, do you know why that is?" Again he shook his head. "If you ever repeat this Toby, I will deny it. Because, I would be afraid of losing you. Your family means everything to you. Remember the day you finally told your father that you were in love with me and he told you to get out. You cried that day, Toby, part of it was because you were hoping he was going to except you but most of it was because you were losing your family."

Toby was looking at me. "Toby, I was so happy when Sarah came and told you to come home that your father will talk to you. When I heard the two of you laughing because Sarah had yelled at him so much after he told you to leave. I know it's still taking him time to except you but he's working on it and he loves you."

Tears were coming down Toby's cheeks. "Baby, I love you. I'm sorry that I'm the way I am sometimes." I hugged my dumb jock. "Now, you're going to take me somewhere." He looked at me. "Apparently I need to apologize to your parents, so you three can get along."

"No, you don't Jack. Thank you, for saying what you did. Yes, my family means a lot to me. The world, but you're also in my world. Jack, even as much as you go out on me. I hate it, you know I do." I nodded my head at him, I know he hates me stepping out on him, but he tolerates it, because he knows it makes me happy. "I wish you wouldn't Jack, and that is what my parents do too."

"I know baby, all I can say is I'll try to be good. I love you, Toby." Hell I couldn't promise anything, if a man will throw some money at me, I'm going to take it and anything he's got.

**Toby**

I'm amazed at what Jack said, it was truly out of character for him. I guess somewhere in him he does love me. But I'm not going to go back to my parents right now, yeah I know they have the best interest in mind for me, but it's my decision when to let Jack go not theirs.

Now that I have a stable job and a decent income, I've decided I would try finishing my bachelors which I started a couple of years back after I bailed on being a cop. Darrin said it would be a good idea if I wanted to move up in the job anyways.

When I first had applied to the university they had taken my associates degree and applied most of my classes which I had taken as core to their core curriculum classes. So it was great I didn't have repeat the courses or spend the money. So between two terms I was able to knock out a few classes, I couldn't go full time due to working so much but I was able to complete six classes. Hopefully I can find a few nights or weekend classes that I can take, it may take a few more years to finish up but I have time.

It had been a few more weeks, Jack has been over every night. He hasn't complained once, I've been amazed. The couch is a pull out, so the first night he was wondering where we were going to sleep but I smiled and started removing the couch cushions. He has his own keys so he comes and he goes when he pleases, but every night I've come home to him sitting on the couch either filing his nails, reading a fashion mag or doing something Jack loves to do.

The apartment is getting taken over with Jacks stuff. One day Darrin asked how many girls do I live with because my uniform had so much perfume on it from Jack's things. I had to start hanging them on the outside of the closet. But I have my Jack back and I do love him.

I told Jack that I wanted to get back into school and he liked the idea but hated that he wouldn't see me as much. But he knows it will help my career, he just wants me making more money. I know what it is. Which is okay, he wants to be wined and dined, and I can't do that for him right now. I know it's the reasons he steps out on me.

**Jack**

The first night staying with Toby was something else. I didn't know where we were going to sleep, he smiled and started pulling off the couch cushions it was a pull out bed. Oh thank God I didn't have to sleep on top of him the entire night. A cuddlier, I AM NOT. Toby thinks I am, but I've never been one, but I will be for him. He likes it, he's my dumb jock. But tonight, I plan on wearing him out, I've not had a piece of him in a long time.

I waited until we were in the bed before I made my move, because I wish Toby would go bareback with me. It feels so good and I know he would enjoy it better than with the condom. I'll even just do it with spit if he would do it bare, I would take some pain, not like I haven't been rode enough where it wouldn't hurt.

I started kissing him on the neck, I straddled him and kissed him. I was humping his stomach, I do love kissing him. I moved down to his neck again he was rubbing my back. "Baby, mmm..." Toby kept saying. Maybe I got him this time.

He only had boxers on, he never wears anything else to sleep in. I know if I would let him he would go sleep naked. He never did at his parents because he was afraid of who would walk in. His parents never allowed locks on any door in the house, WEIRD, but at least they did knock first.

So the boxers were off quick as I could say, gloss, and Toby was hard and I was shedding my clothes. I never did end up measuring Toby, but I love how big and oh so thick and nice it is. He stretches me and when his cock grazes my prostate, honey let me tell you, it is out of this world. But again I wish it was just Toby in there and not Toby covered in latex.

I licked him and precum came gushing out, he always did have a lot, but as I said before he tastes good. "Jack, baby." I smiled and took him completely in, I'm good at deep throating always have been since my early teen years, but we won't go into that now.

I'd been collecting what I could of Toby's precum and my spit as I was sucking him and opening myself up, lubing my entrance. I climbed back up Toby and kissed him and tried to point his cock to my opening and push back before he realized but he grabbed me. "Jack what are you doing. God, you know this is my one rule."

Fuck I was screaming in my head, I almost had him. "Honey, please, you would love the feel. I'm clean, I swear."

"No Jack." He was breathing heavy, I know he was angry but I know he was still so aroused.

"Where are your condoms and lube?" I asked and he pointed to the side table. I lean over and open the drawer and got them and he took the condom as I lubed my entrance and then lubed him. He got up on his knees and pulled me up to him, I was still on my back and entered me. He loves fucking me that way, so he can see my face I think and give me a hand job. When he really wants to fuck me hard he will have me up on my knees. I do like that, it's so impersonal.

Since he hasn't fucked in a while he was cumming quick, but that is okay, the way he was hitting my prostate and jerking me off, he had me cumming with him. He knows I don't like to get smothered by him so he won't lay down on me, I've trained him well. Also I don't like the smell of his sperm in the condom, love the taste hate the smell. So I make him tie his condom, I don't mind my ass on the outside, but not his sperm. So when he takes a condom off he automatically ties the top off, got him trained like a good puppy.

Over the following month Toby was getting depressed I could tell it. So I finally went against him and headed off to his parents. He was still at work, I knew what time Bill and Betty got home, so I was waiting on their porch when they arrived. They must be driving together these days, because they were in the same car but in their work clothes. They didn't even pull into the garage when they saw me, they parked and got out of their car. "Mr. and Mrs. Smith."

"Jack?" Bill responded. "Would you like to come in?"

"Actually yes, if I could please." I think they were surprised that I was being so polite. We went into the living room and sat down. "Well, I guess I'll start. Toby is miserable without you all, he says he isn't but I know he is. You know Toby he's not going to crawl back. I know you don't think I'm right for your son, but he loves me and I love him, believe it or not."

"Jack..."

"Mr. Smith, please. Let me finish." I didn't mean to be mean to Bill but I wanted to get my point across. "Toby needs you, no matter if I'm in his life or not. It shouldn't matter to you, who he choices to love."

"What are Sarah and you on the same wavelength?" Bill responded. "Toby won't answer my calls or his sister's, no one knows where he lives or works. Not that I couldn't find it out, but I'm not going to invade his privacy just to find him."

I handed him my copy of the apartment key and the address. "I won't go there tonight, he comes home always at seven-thirty sharp as eyeliner." I smiled. "Be in the apartment don't go a knocking. Talk to your son." I got up and Betty actually hugged me, which was the first time. "Oh honey, I love your perfume, Bulgari Blanc." Betty nodded at me, I really didn't need confirmation. I know my scents.

**Toby**

I walked into my apartment expecting to find Jack sitting in his usual spot only to find my Dad standing looking out my only window, Jack I shook my head. "Dad."

He turned around. "Tobias, interesting apartment you have, reminds me a lot like what your mom and I had when we first started out. It was a little bigger, I don't know how you're doing it with Jack living here with you." He laughed, he motioned to the kitchen table it only had two seats. I still didn't speak.

"Toby, your mother and I were wrong to try to force you to make a decision that you weren't obviously ready to make. We need to understand that you're a man, that you can make your own choices, be them right or wrong for you."

"Thank you Dad. I know Jack isn't the best for me, but I love him and he loves me."

"I know son, I could tell when he came and saw your mother and I, but he should be faithful to the relationship. Not run after every Tom, Dick and Harry who has money and fast cars." I gave my dad a look. "You don't think I haven't investigated who he's fucking around on you with?" I really looked like I wanted to cry now, why did he have to go and do that. I was find in my world of denial. "Toby you did know, right?"

"Yeah, but, I didn't want to really know. Denial works great for me dad."

My dad blew out a breath. "Son, that kid loves you somewhere amongst the makeup and styling gel and I hate to even admit it but you two do have a weird relationship that seems to fit for each other. I wish he wouldn't step out on you."

"I know Dad."

"Well, Sunday dinners stand you know. So why don't Jack and you come this weekend. Your mom would love to see you."

"I won't every Sunday unless we can come late, I don't get out of work until 7."

"Well have Jack meet you on those days, we can hold dinner or you can make a plate when you come. We can be nice to Jack, we have been in the past. Then we can catch up on some football before the season ends. I turned your TV on, son you have to get some cable in here."

"Yeah, I have to afford it first and I need to be home a little more than I am. When you're working twelve hour days it doesn't give you much time for channel surfing."

"True."

"Plus I have my own built in entertainment." He looked at me and I smiled. "I have Jack." We both laughed, he knew exactly what I was talking about. Jack when he was in Jack mode could just fly off the handle and bitch and complain about anything. Or he could be painting his nails or seeing what he could do with his face, so he could do it to a model. I wasn't going to tell him how often we have sex now.

**Jack**

Toby's family have been nice to me for months now, I wonder when the shit is going to hit the fan. We go over every Sunday and I mean every Sunday. Ugh! I wish we didn't have to but I do it for Toby.

When Toby has to work, I make it there just before they eat, sometimes if I'm in a good mood I'll be an hour early and help out where Betty needs. But I don't like getting there too early. They always eat at six-thirty sharp as eyeliner, when Toby works he will get there around seven-forty-five, then he and his father watch whatever game is on. If it be football, basketball or baseball season, sometimes the occasion hockey game, or they can talk about meaningless garbage for hours. Whatever. On the days I drive separate I leave early.

In January, I came home one night after he had been home from work for a while and he was apparently mad at me. I asked him what was wrong and he told me nothing and turned over and when to sleep. That weekend, I found out, I'd forgot his birthday. Oopsies. Well, we were celebrating it on that Sunday with his family, why did I have to tell him on his real birthday? Gee.

The following week he started classes so I didn't see him as much anymore, and when he was home he was buried nose deep in a book all the time. I couldn't get his attention to save my life. "Toby, I'm pregnant."

"Okay Jack that's great."

"We're having puppies, alien puppies."

"Jack please, I need to study."

That is all I heard. Jack I need to study. I even started going down on him and got his cock out and he didn't notice until he felt my mouth on the head of his penis. Then his tune changed, of course he will pay attention when it comes to sex, but when I just want to talk to him, NO. Or maybe I can swing this into my favor, get what I want out of it, like in the olden days. I could help him study, reward him and maybe get my bareback ride. MMmmm.

So in the evenings when I would get off work I would come home and read what he's supposed to have read. Toby is a slow reader, another one of his dumb jock traits. Like his father says, he may have gotten hit a tad too many times. He would come in and I would let him read for a little while when he didn't have class, and then I would test him.

I was pre prepared for him one day when he walked in. I had a plug in my ass, so I was well lubed and opened for him but he didn't come home right away. When he finally came in, he looked worn out so I just undressed him completely, and I mean completely and put him to bed.

I knew what I was doing, I was going to let him fall asleep and I'm going to ride him. I suck him off all the time and he wakes up loving it, why can't he wake up with me riding him. So I turned off all the lights and got undressed myself, crawled on top of him and was about to start rubbing him when he pushing me aside and runs to the bathroom. Then I hear him, disgusting he's throwing up. I got up and got dressed. "Babe, you know I don't handle sick people. Call me when you're better. Love you." I left.

**Toby**

I had to call my mom I could barely get out of bed, called off work for a few days. Thank God I'd finally started earning sick days and it was the end of my work week. My mom came over and took care of me.

"Jack always abandons you when you need him the most."

"Jack doesn't do sick Mom, you know that." Mom should know that, he never would stay around anytime I would get sick when I lived at home, Jack is a germaphobe.

"Well he needs to grow up because one of these days it's going to be him and he'll want you around." As she laid an ice pack on my forehead and wouldn't let me cover because I was running a temp. I was freezing.

I was down for a few days, mom made sure I had enough fluids in my apartment, she wanted me to come home for the few days, but I wouldn't. I can be sick, yeah I had to call her to come, but I can be sick in my own place. I'm going to have to be more prepare next time, maybe have a sick box, stocked with the essentials.
