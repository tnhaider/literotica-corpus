 I've always thought my life would be perfect, but if you told me 6 weeks ago everything would turn out the way it did, I would have told you that you were crazy and that you don't know me. Everything would have changed if I knew the whole story behind it, but for some reason I always knew that I would meet that special person that I can truly say I love her. If only I knew...

6 Weeks ago.

I woke up that morning with the feeling I am getting sick with the flu. I looked outside my college dorm bedroom and see a grey sheet over the sky with a wisp of cold in the air. The winter is soon setting in Seattle. My roommate Arthur is still sleeping. I can see he had a rough night of studying as all of his books were packed on his bed side table. He always called it light bed time reading. I smiled as I think of his weird ways. He is your typical jock with the exception of always having his nose in a book if he is not on the field playing rugby, football or swimming. I got out of my single bed and moved my navy blue covers to the side of the bed. 

Its kind off chilly in the room and I can feel the cold run over my slightly brown tanned skin. My muscled tensed up and I blew a "brrr" out of the reaction. I pulled my slightly skew boxers over my hips and walked to the shared bathroom. As I stood and have my morning pee, I looked in the side mirror and admired my progress of working out for 2 hours every day. 

Melissa always liked rubbing her hands on my chest and muscled arms. I walked to the side cabinet and pulled out the medicine box I kept in handy. I drank a few flu pills and some vitamin supplements. I walked back in the room and hovered over the idea of waking Arthur, but as he really seemed tired I left him and decided to get dressed and go meet Melissa at the college cafeteria. 

Melissa, how deeply I was in love with her. It felt like she had some magical spell over me that made me infatuated with her. She was one of the prettiest girls I have I ever met. She came with a friend last year to my 21st birthday bash that my friends surprised me with and we hit it off immediately. We started dating a week after that and it's been going great ever since. She has been feeling under the weather for the past week, but I think it's the stress of the finals creeping up on her. 

I got dressed and quietly closed the dorm door so Arthur can sleep till he feels like waking up. I walked past the cold narrow hallways and greeted a few other guys I knew. As I walked out the front of the building I walked smacked into a skinny dark haired guy I've never seen before.

"Ouch! So sorry man! You OK?" I quickly asked as I was rubbing my head and looking at the green shirt he was wearing. 

It caught my eye as I realized it was a shirt I seen in South Africa when I went on holiday with my parents last year. 

"I'm so sorry man!" he quickly apologized as he grabbed a box of clothes he was carrying that fell on the floor as we collided. 

"I didn't see you and I thought the doors pulled instead of pushed to get open. I'm looking for the front office. I'm new here." He said as he looked at me and I realized he had the greenest emerald eyes I've ever seen. 

"Yeah sure, don't worry about it. It's just down the hall to your left. You can't miss it." I said as I pushed the door open for him so he can walk in with the brown box of clothes. 

"Thanks!" he replied and gave me a wide smile as he passed. I went thru the door and walked down the stairs to my car, which is parked a few yards away from my usual spot I liked to, sit and listen music to. 

As I got in my car to get my student ID card I saw Melissa getting out of a red BMW that stopped in front of the building opposite from the main building. She quickly grabbed her bag and half run up the stairs to the girls dormitory. I looked as the BMW sped off and thought that it was weird as her mother didn't drive a BMW and I didn't know anyone that drove one. I took my phone from my pocket and scrolled down to her name. I stood there for about 2 minutes thinking of phoning her when my phone rang and I realized it was her. 

I answered it quickly. She sounded different but still, I could tell there was something in her voice that gave me chills as I knew something was wrong. 

"Listen Thomas, I need to speak with you. There is something I can't hide from you anymore. Can you meet me in the college park in 10 minutes please?" She asked as I was standing there with a feeling in my gut that just got worse and worse. 

I replied "sure thing" and she hung up. The park was a mere 5 minutes' walk from where my car was standing and I quickly locked it again. As I walked to the park the gloomy air and feeling of a near deserted campus made the feeling just worse. I knew something was up with her. I just hope it's not what I think it is. I got to the park and sit down by our favorite bench under the big acorn tree. 

I pulled my hair out of my face and listened to the sound of the wind blowing thru the trees. I looked up to the clouds again. It made me just want to go back and climb in my bed. I pulled around quickly as Melissa turned out from around the tree and called my name. I knew she was crying as her face was red and her eyes were puffy. 

"What's wrong babe?" I asked as I took my hands and placed them on her, but she just pulled them off again. 

"Thomas... I have something to tell you. I just don't know how and I feel really awful about this, but I can't keep going on like this." She half stammered as she tried to keep herself from crying again. 

"What's wrong Melissa?" I asked with a little fear in my voice as I knew what she was going to say... 

"I want to break up Thomas, I fell in love with someone else. I feel really bad about this, but I can't help it. I wished it didn't happen." She said with tears in her eyes. 

That was the last time I spoke to her. After she told me that last sentence I just turned around half running and walking away from the park. She was yelling at me to come back, but I couldn't. I couldn't see her. I was so angry with her, myself and the world. I was heartbroken and furious. Why? That's all I wanted to know. Why? I don't know how long I walked with everything that happened still stuck in my mind. At one point I realized that my face was cold and that I actually cried. As I wiped my face with my shirt , I looked up and realized I walked to the woods where the college was bordered against. I just fell down to the ground and pushed my head against a tree. I knew things won't ever be the same again. 

Why did it hurt so much? 

I was clenching a small branch in my hand and realized that the sides were cutting into my skin. 

I got back after dark that night. I walked into the dorm to find Arthur sitting on his bed with a psychology book. He looked up at me with a weird expression on his face. 

"Listen man... What happened, happened. You can't change any of this. 

Melissa called. She was looking for you. She told me everything." He said as he put the book down and walked towards me. 

I just turned around and walked to the bathroom. Closing the door behind me and opening the water to the shower. I pulled my shoes off and removed my pants. As I was just standing under the warm water of the shower I felt like everything just washed away. I couldn't help but feel sorry for myself. At that point I wished none of this had happened and that I never met her. I don't know how long I stood in the shower and thought about all the great nights and special moment I've had with her. Eventually the water was getting really cold and I got out and put my black Puma jockey on I loved wearing. I opened the door and went straight to bed. Arthur was nowhere to be found in the dorm and I guessed he left me for some privacy. I fell asleep quickly...

The following week passed so quickly I thought that time has moved three times the speed. Every day felt the same. I haven't seen Melissa that entire week and I couldn't be happier about it. I awoke the Monday morning with the usual grey sky outside. It was raining the previous day and I spend most of the time just working out. I am really starting to get nicely ripped. My v-line is especially visible as if it was carved out if marble. 

I got up and dressed and decided on going for a walk around campus today as it's the second part exams for all psychology majors. No work for me I thought as I walked out the front doors of the dorm. I was wearing my black hoody and whitish blue jeans. 

As I got to the park of the college I realized that the guy I walked into the other day was sitting on a bench with a tablet and was probably listening to music as he had his head phones on. The really weird thing about it was that he was wearing no warm clothing. He was just sitting there with a black jean, but with a normal white t-shirt and flops. I walked towards him with the intention of offering him a jacket as he might not have one. There are a few students here that aren't that well off as most of the campus. 

He looked up at me as a reached to where he was sitting. As he looked up to me, I again saw the green of his eyes and stared for a split second too long. He pulled of his headphones and said hi. 

"Hey man! Listen... aren't you cold? Do you need a jacket or something? You can borrow one of mine." I said as I looked him up and down with a concerned look on my face. 

He just looked at his own bare arms and started laughing. 

"It's OK dude. I'm from South Africa and its much warmer there then here. I am used to about 30 degrees Celsius weather and its only cool here. Not really cold." He said as he fold up his legs and put the tablet down next to him. 

"You're from South Africa?!" I eagerly asked him as I loved the place when we went on vacation.

"Yes, I lived in Johannesburg , but my parents moved to US about 3 years ago. My parents live in New York currently." 

We talked some more and exchanged names. His name was Ryan and about the same age as me. He has a smaller build body then me and about the same length. He speaks English and a local South African language called Afrikaans, which is similar to Dutch and Holland.

We ended up talking for hours. I can't remember the last time I had such a great conversation with someone. We learned so much about each other, but mostly me from him. Eventually it was about 3:30 PM and we decided on doing something. I suggested I show him the woods on the side of the college as he hasn't seen it yet. We walked and chatted for the entire trip. When we got to the clearing of the woods, you could hear the rustling of leaves all around you and the flow of water about 50 yards away. We walked to the river and sat on the big grey rocks that lined the river. It had crystal clear water. 

After a while he suggested we go in for a dip in the water, but I declined that. Knowing these waters too well I knew that it was ice as hell, but he kept nagging me. In the end he said that he would go in by himself and called me a chicken.

I just laughed and said he is more than welcome to jump in.

He got up and pulled his shirt off his body and I couldn't help but look at his well-defined abs and arms. Even though they weren't big build, but still nicely cut. He shook his hair when he removed his shirt and started removing his jeans and I started feeling awkward looking at him, so I turned my stare to the water. 

I couldn't help but notice he was wearing very similar underwear like mine and that he had a rather nice looking firm bubble butt on him. What am I thinking?! I am a guy and he is a guy. I can't have thoughts like this, but I could barely even finish my internal debate as he spoke to me.

"So you're going to really chicken out then?" He asked with a devilish grin on his face. 

I laughed and declined the offer again. He just turned around and exposed his cute ass to me again. He jump in the water and came up really quickly again with a sharp shriek. 

"Geez that's cold!" He yelled as he desperately tried to swim back to the shore of the river to get out. 

I started laughing my head off and said he had it coming not listening to me, but he just then splashed me with water. 

"You suck man! You could have told me the water was freezing!" He yelled at me as he was climbing on a few rocks to try and get out of the water. 

I couldn't help but stare at him. He was a real good looking guy. 

I could clearly see the outline of his cock thru the thin fabric he was wearing. About 4 and a half inches. Nearly beating my 5 inches. He laughed again as he was trying to pull his brown hair out of his face. I felt a weird feeling in my stomach looking at him and felt my cock stir as he was standing there drenched to the bone. I couldn't understand how this guy is standing in front of me and making me get hard. Everything just didn't make sense. 

He climbed down the big rock towards the river bed, but the next moment he slipped on the smaller one and fell.

He smacked his head really hard on the big rock and fell back into the water. I nearly jumped out of my skin as I tried to get up as quick as my legs would allow it to try and help him get out of the water. I jumped in the river with clothes and all as I knew he could drown if he was knocked unconscious. The cold of the water hit my skin like a thousand knives.

I saw his head go under water and swam to him as fast as I could. I grabbed him around the waist and pulled him up from the water. He had a small trail of blood running from his head and looked like he wasn't breathing. I pulled him on the river bed and pushed him on his back. I held my head close to his nose and listened for any sounds of breathing. There was none. I started freaking out and screamed for help. I've seen how to do CPR and performed it instantly. I blew air directly in his mouth as our lips made contact. By the 3rd try he started choking out water and gasped for air. 

"What happened?" He asked as he pushed his hand to his head and looked at the slight blood running from the wound. 

It didn't look serious enough for stitches, but still might have had a concussion. 

"You slipped and fell from the big boulder over there... Are you OK man? I thought you died for a moment there." I said out of breath. 

A feeling of relief blew over me as he sat up right and hold his head with a dazed look on his face. 

"Come on. We need to get you to a hospital." I said as I pulled him up and helped him put his jeans on. 

When we got to the hospital he was quickly taken in by a nurse. About an hour later he came out of the ER as I was sitting on the seat looking like a hurricane survivor. He had a small cut on the head, but nothing serious. 

I took him to my dorm room so he can get a shower. His room doesn't have a build in shower. When we got there Arthur wasn't there. He probably was at the library reading or something. 

"We need to get you into a shower and some nice warm clothes man. You can use some of mine." I said as I led him inside and closed the door. 

"Gee thanks man! You really don't have to go thru all this trouble. I'm not a paraplegic you know." He laughed. 

"No ways man! You went thru hell there and besides, the showers in the main dorm bathrooms are much better and more private then the full public ones down stairs. I opened the warm water in the shower to let it run and steam up the bathroom.

He came in and said thanks again. I pulled out a towel and some clean clothes for him out of the drawer under the sink. 

"You can wear these clothes... they don't fit me so well, but for you it should be fine." I said as I handed over the shirt and long pajama pants. 

As he took them from me our fingers connected and he looked me in the eyes the whole time. I thought nothing of it and turned around to leave, but he stopped me. 

"You going to help me shower?" He asked with an almost childlike expression on his face. 

For a few seconds I just stood there, not knowing what to say or do, but he started to undress his jeans and he was struggling to get it off him. I just stood there and tried not to really look as the whole situation was getting more and more uncomfortable for me, but he nearly collapsed again. 

I grabbed him under the arm just in time to stop him from falling. In the process of him falling I accidentally felt his crotch rubbing against my leg. He apologized again, but I could hardly think of anything else now. The feeling of him in my arms was more erotic for me than anything else I've ever felt. Not even Melissa was able to do this to me. 

I guess it was part of the fact that it was wrong in my eyes, but yet felt so good. As he looked up to me he realized I was staring into the depths of his soul thru his eyes. As I looked at him I could feel some sort of force pulling us together and closer.

I can feel the hotness of his breath on my skin, the soft touch of his hands on my arms. I leaned in closer and felt him move forward. This was so perfect, yet so wrong. Our lips connect and I can feel the electricity running thru my skin. I closed my eyes and feel the warmth of his breath fill my lungs. He moved his hands over on my back and pulled me closer to him. Our bodies touched and I could feel the hardness of his cock against my thigh. I moved my hands to his back and touch the softness of his ass. He made slight moaning sound and I pressed harder with my hands. 

The erotic feel of his hands moving up and down my back was giving me chills like a winters wind blowing thru a crack. I felt myself losing more and more of my sanity. The wrongness of everything that's happening is like a flame rustling in me, trying to escape somehow. And I knew how..

I slip my fingers down his back towards his briefs. Still embraced in the erotic pulse. I tugged gently at the white fabric and slid it down in a fluent motion, at that moment he grabbed my belt buckle and slid it loose, tugged at my zipper and slid in his hand. I felt a slight quiver as his hand made contact with my now fully erect penis. In a few moments he was on his knees, exposing my cock in the motion and leaned forward. I slid my hands around his muscular neck twiddling my fingers in his hair, over his ears. It sent my senses racing. He parted his lips and I pulled him forward. He slowly slid my cock into his mouth and then toward his throat.

A moan now escaped my throat and I started moving my hips in a slow and fluent motion. My cock head only slightly escaping his lips before I slid it back in. He grasped my balls and gave it a light tug. He looked up into my eyes, an emotion I could not quite fathom lingered in them. I tugged at his hair and he came up, taking my shirt up with him. 

He pulled my shirt over my head and dropped it on the floor. Our lips made contact once again. I found my hands grabbing his ass and pulling him closer so our cocks rub against each other. My fingers move more inwards and found his tight hole and softly moved my finger over the outline. I grabbed him on the shoulders and turned him around in one swift motion. 

His ass now fully exposed to be taken by my full 8.5 inch hard cock. He put his hands against the bathroom wall as I spit on my left hand whilst rubbing my cock with precum. As I insert my finger I feel him tense up. I moved my finger more vigorously to make him wet for my assault. I couldn't take the wait anymore and in one fluent motion I rammed my cock up his ass to the hilt. He screamed in his fist as I stood still so he can adjust to my size in his tight ass.

After a minute I slowly pull out and push back in again. The warmth and tightness of his ass was almost over whelming and I felt like I could bust my nut right there and then. As I gather momentum and grab him on his hips to forcefully move my cock deeper and harder in him. The slap of his ass against me was echoing thru the bathroom. The feeling was amazing and I slip my hand to his now hard cock and slowly jerked him as I fucked him. I could feel him tensing up more against me and feel how his ass is massaging my cock every time he tensed.
