 Author's Note: Thanks to everyone who sent me feedback and for all your support! Special thanks to my beautiful editor ThisKittyKatâ€”she has been wonderful throughout this entire process and I couldn't have done it without her.

If you haven't read the first chapter of this story, please take time to do so. The action picks up right where the last chapter left off, so if you didn't read the first part you'll be lost. More to come so keep with me!
