 Peter lost himself in a crowed train station while still in his disguise. He walked right past two members of his organization, not being noticed by either of them. Still, he ducked into an adjacent pub, quickly finding a seat at a table where he could see the front door, yet was close to the back door if an immediate escape was required. 

He wasn't ready to give himself up, just yet. There was still left the element of an unexpected visit with the leader of his organization that he wanted to accomplish before he turned himself in. If he could convince the man his presence was needed in America that would benefit everyone involved. He would have time to affect his release and complete the obligations of his visa, so he could naturalize as an American citizen. But, there was no way of knowing if all of this would come together, as he had planned, until he could talk to the man.

His eyes constantly watched the door waiting for his train to leave for his destination. It was time he had to think about his friends in Arizona. How he missed Bruce already and wished he was lying next to him. His thoughts wandered as he sat, guarding the door with trained eyes, watching every move anyone made in, or outside the pub. 

Recalling the feel of Bruce's strong body made him shudder suddenly. It almost shocked him that he could allow that to happen to him. Anyone could have noticed it, but he could explain it away by saying there was a chill in the air. And there was.
