 Hey there fellow Litsters!

This is my first (and probably last) attempt at Gay Male. The inception of the story happened when a female author friend of mine (who adores this category) placed a bet with me that a straight guy (namely me) cannot write a Gay story. Here is my attempt at proving her wrong. I look forward to your comments and feedback here.

It is also my submission for the Halloween contest so please do vote.

DISCLAIMER- This story contains scenes of non-consensual and semi-consensual sex as well as emotional distress. It also contains scenes of recreational drug use. If such material offends you, do not read further.
