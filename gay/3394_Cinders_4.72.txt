 Foreward: This is a little different from my normal fare, but I thought I'd give it a try. It's a classic fairytale twisted and reimagined, and the structure might give you pause occasionally, but try to roll with it. All constructive criticism is welcome. If you read my blog, you've probably already seen this (I posted it in pieces earlier this year) but I hope it's worth a second look. A few things to be wary of along the way: insinuations of underage sex (not shown), casual violence, disturbing imagery, and death. There's a lot of lighter stuff as well, but consider this fair warning. 

And on that cheery note, thank you so much for reading, and happy holidays to everybody:)

PS-I'm wrapping up a sequel to Pandora, which I'll start posting here soon
