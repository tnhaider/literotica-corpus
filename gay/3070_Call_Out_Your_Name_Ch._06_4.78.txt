 I received so much feedback from readers upset by the death of my main characters that I decided to write this alternate ending for those of you who wanted a live Happy Ever After for Jesse and Shane. I apologize to anyone who was shocked by my first ending, although I stand by it since tragedy is a part of our lives. This is for you and takes up where Chapter 4 ends so some of it was covered in the original Chapter 5. Enjoy.
