 "I hope this damn thing doesn't hurt your back. It's not exactly new." Annie looked with concern at the old brown plaid couch. 

"It'll be fine," Steve said. He dropped his blue duffle bag on the floor and wrapped his arms around her. "Seriously Sis, thank you so much for letting me stay with you. I really needed to get out of that small town and into the city, where things happen."

Annie hugged him back. "I'm just glad you're here. It'll be good to have family around. I love my roommate, Mark. He's like another brother to me, but you and I share a history. Nobody else quite gets my jokes like my little brother."

She stepped back, ruffled his dark brown hair with her fingertips and smiled. Annie and Steve were four years apart and she had treated him like her own personal doll from the time he was born, keeping watch over him and telling her mother what to do for him in a way that had exasperated her mother at times. Annie and Steve had a connection that nothing could break. 

One of the two bedroom doors opened and Mark stepped out. "Oh, great! You're here! Welcome to our humble abode!" 

Mark crossed the distance quickly with his long legs and Steve put out his hand to shake but Mark just took it and pulled him in for a hug. 

"Annie has told me sooo much about her little brother. We're so happy to have you here." Mark stepped back and beamed. 

Steve just smiled bemusedly. "I'm... glad you feel that way and that I'm not putting you guys out."

"Absolutely not," Mark replied with a wave of his hand. "You are welcome to stay here as long as you like. Now, it's already six o'clock. I insist on taking you both out for dinner. Chinese?"

Annie looked at Steve and he nodded. "Sounds great to me."

"Okay, there is the most fabulous little place two blocks down. You're just going to love it."
