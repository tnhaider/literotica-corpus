**Alex's Point of View**

I woke to lips pressed gently against mine. What an amazing way to wake up. I kissed back, opening my eyes.

"Happy Birthday, Alex!" Nick said as his face was hovering over mine.

"Thank you, baby." I said, wrapping my arms around his back and pulling him down for another kiss. I looked over at the clock and saw the time. "Time to get to work! Don't want to make you late."

"I don't mind." Nick replied, smiling.

"The sooner you get up now, the faster you can get back in bed tonight." I grinned.

"Fine." He said, defeated by the real world. "But tonight is going to be special."

"If you insist, but I don't mind just having you in this bed all to myself."

"Don't worry, you'll get that, but there's more you'll just have to wait and see." He kissed me again.

After a long day of work I went straight to Nick's house. We don't live together but I constantly at his place. When he opened the door I saw the room full of balloons. "Hey baby, how was your day?" He asked, pulling me in and kissing me before I could respond.

"Not the best, but better now." I said. He led me into the kitchen where the table was set and the food was just about ready. "It smells amazing in here."

"Let's hope the steak tastes as good as it smells." He replied.

After dinner he brought over brownies. Just what I want. "Thanks Nick, you didn't have to do all this."

"I wanted to." He said, placing his hand on top of mine.

We went into the living room and watched a movie. When it ended Nick got up and told me to stay put.

"I'm not the best at gift-giving, but I hope you like it." He said, returning.

"I appreciate it no matter what. Thank you." 

I unwrapped the box, then took the top part off. Inside, under tissue paper was a first edition of the first novel. Wow.

"Open the cover." He said. I did, inside was J.K Rowling's signature.

"Oh my god, this is incredible. It must've been so hard to get. It's too much." I said, still in shock.

"I hope you love it. It's not too much, just seeing your face light up makes it all worth it. Besides, a client had a connection so It wasn't even hard to get."

"Thank you." I kissed him. "I thought you said you weren't good giving gifts?"

"I'm not. Seriously don't expect anything better than this, cause its swears from now on."

"I'm okay with that." I kissed him again.

"There's one more thing, but it's not nearly as cool." He said, pulling out a key from his back pocket. "It's yours - if you want it. I want you to move in with me, please."

I took the key in my hands. "I'd love to." I kissed him hard. "Now I'd really like to take you to bed and take care f you, baby."

"But it's your birthday, it should be the other way around."

"Trust me, you will be taking care of me too." I began to kiss his neck. His breathing got heavier as my kisses got stronger. I got up and pulled him with me. I took his hand and mine and led him toward the bedroom.

Once at the foot of the bed, I lifted his shirt over his head. My tongue swirled across his smooth skin, my lips pushing hard to taste as much of him as possible. I felt the warmth of his hands on my back come up from under my shirt, pulling it with him. My lip let go of him just long enough to get the shirt over my head, returning swiftly back to his chest. His heart was beating fast, but not in a bad way.

"Keep going, baby." He moaned. "Don't stop."

I slowly laid him down on the bed, my lips never losing contact with his skin. I worked down his gorgeous stomach, his abs tensing under the heat of my mouth. I reached the waistband of his jeans, unbuttoning and unzipping them. Once he was freed from the jeans, I couldn't help but laugh a little when I saw his underwear. He is wearing very sexy white Calvin Klein briefs. "Nice underwear baby, but they look extremely familiar..." I teased.

He lifted his head to make eye contact with me, smirking. "I did laundry earlier today and couldn't resist wearing your briefs. I feel so sexy wearing your underwear." He said, laughing a little.

"Remind me to let you do all of my laundry, especially my underwear from now on. Damn, they look so sexy on you, baby." I kissed one side of his inner groin.

"Oh, do you now? See, when I first put them on I thought you'd like to see this side more..." He said, flipping over to lie on his stomach. I leaned back to admire the view he was giving me. Just when I thought it couldn't get better, he thrust his ass up in the air, arching his back an insane amount so that his butt was just begging for attention.

"What do you think?" He asked, his voice oozing with sexiness.

That did me in. My Texan accent was thick as I replied, "I think you made me one very happy southern boy right about now." I kissed his butt cheek through the fabric. Then I kissed my way up his athletic, strong back until I had my whole body covering his as I lay on top of him. I covered my hands over his, pulling them over our heads on the mattress. My lips nibbled on his ear and then I whispered, "You stole my underwear. That's naughty, you'll have to be punished." I teased.

"If you insist." He replied. "But before you punish me..." and as his lips spoke the last word he ground his ass into my crotch, my now rock hard crotch.

"Oh, that's it! You're done!" I yelled, reaching for the sides of his stomach and tickling him. He managed to turn around but couldn't stop me, my weight and strength overpowering him. I was now sitting on top of him as he laughed in pain, trying to fight back and trying to get out from under me. After a little bit I could tell he was getting tired, so I stopped. I leaned down so my face was close to his. I caressed his forehead and front of his hair. "That'll teach you." I said, but it came out much more quiet and peaceful than aggressive. I got lost in his beautiful brown eyes as ran both of my hands over his head. "You're amazing, you know that?"

"I'm even more amazing with you." I leaned down and kissed him. His kissed give me butterflies every time. I can't imagine how I lived without them before him.

"What are you doing, wearing those pants still?" He laughed, tapping my ass.

"Well, I was getting there but someone needed to get punished." I retorted. I resumed kissing him, working my way down his body again. I reached the waistband of *my* underwear and pulled back until he kicked them off his feet. I kissed all over his bush then worked down towards his inner thigh. Finally my tongue reached his ball sack, and I opened wide to let his balls enter m mouth, sucking them as I ran my fingers over his dick. Then I took a firm hold of his shaft and slapped it onto my tongue before quickly enclosing my lips around the circumference.

His hands gripped onto my hair as I continuously slid my mouth up and down his hard cock. I could hear his moans get deeper as his cock began to pulse more and more. "Cum for me, baby." I said. Less than thirty seconds after continuing to slide my tongue over his shaft he began to release his hot load. 

"Oooh, fuck Alex, mmmm" he moaned as he filled my mouth. Once he finished I swallowed the remaining cum before kissing the base of his cock, burying my nose in his pubes.

"Happy birthday to me! That was delicious." I said. I looked up to see him with his head flat against the mattress, eyes closed, spent from what just happened. I moved back up and kissed his cheek.

"Take your pants off." He said sternly. "Please..." He laughed, unable to hold the serious face.

"Why would I do that?" I teased.

"Because I really want you to make love to me..."

"Nah, that's a stupid reason." I laughed.

"That's fine. I guess you don't want a birthday blowjob either, ya know, cause it'd require you to take your pants off."

We both laughed. "Fine, but let me take care of you first. Then you can give me that final present later, maybe even in the shower..."

"I agree to those terms." He smirked.

I unbuttoned my pants and slid them off. Then I slid my boxer briefs off. "Lay on your side for me baby." I said.

I moved up close to him, the length of our bodies touching at almost every point. I fingered his hole, preparing to enter him. As I did this, I whispered in his ear, "You're so sexy, Nick. I want you so bad baby."

Soon I was pushing the head of my cock in him. With one left arm keeping me balanced on my side, I began to move back and forth, filling him each time a little more until I was completely buried in him. The heat between us began to make us sweat. His damp body felt incredible. Soon I was pounding in and out so fast I got lost in his moans. My right arm wrapped around his waist as I ground my hips against him. "You feel so good baby."

"Uh, please don't stop. You feel so good." He said. I moved my right hand up to his chin, pulling his head to face me. We kissed as I continued to slide in and out of his tight hole.

"You trust me?" I asked.

"I trust you." He kissed me once more before I maneuvered us so he is now laying face down in the pillows. With my arms now wrapped under his above his head, I began to thrust my hips up into the air and then slam them back down. He must be loving it because I can hear his muffled moans through the pillows. My sweaty chest stuck to his sexy back as my cock pounded into his hole over and over, making a slapping sound so loud and intense I was so turned on.

"Fuck, baby, you're so hot." I grunted. Then I decided to change it up again. I stopped when I was fully in him and turned my whole body so that my head was near his feet. I grabbed hold of his ankles and began to thrust into his ass again. God this must've hit an even better spot because I could feel his whole body shake every time I filled him. While this position made my whole body squirm at the needle cum I wanted to hold him as I fucked him. I wanted to make really sweet love to him.

I exited him and sat back at the top of the bed. "Hop on please?" He answered by doing it. He now sat on my cock facing me. I ran my fingers through his hair as I pulled him closer to me so I could kiss him. I then grabbed his ass with my hands and lifted him a little to get a better angle. Once I was set up, my hands wrapped tight around his body as I pounded back into him hard. I bounced up and down, my balls slapping against his ass as I fucked him hard. Soon I was blasting my load up his ass.

"Fuck me" he moaned. "Cum in me Alex!" I grunted as shot after shot filled his hole, falling back onto my cock and running down to my balls as I continued thrusting in him.

When it was over he quickly got off of me and slid down to my cock. "Let me take care of this mess you made." He smirked. He began licking up all of the cum that had fallen back down onto my cock and balls.

"Let's go take care of the birthday boy properly in the shower..." He said, getting up and pulling me towards the bathroom. And he did, oh boy, did he take care of me.

***Nick's Point of View***

We decided to do Thanksgiving with his family and Christmas with mine. We flew to Texas on the Wednesday before Thanksgiving and his parents picked us up at the airport. When they saw us they excitedly waved. While his mother hugged him, his father shook my hand. Then his mother shook my hand and his dad hugged him.

"It is so nice to meet you, Nick." His mother said.

"Yes it is, you are all he talks about when we call." His father chimed in.

"It is nice to meet you both as well, Mr. and Mrs. Pearson."

"Please, call us Shannon and Mike." His mother said warmly in her smooth southern accent.

They drove us to their home. Its a beautiful home on a gorgeous land. Inside was all decorated for the season, warm and inviting. I met his brother, Mark, and sister, Lauren, and their spouses. They both have adorable children that are extremely excited to see Santa in the parade.

Seeing his family just makes everything I already knew about Alex make more sense, and I learned new stuff. Mark and Lauren snuck me up to his bedroom where they showed me his baby photos.

"Look at that one, it's my favorite!" Lauren said, pointing to one of him sitting on Santas lap as a baby, crying hysterically.

"I knew you would do this, you two are screwed!" Alex said, swiftly entering the room. "And you, Nick, to think I trusted you!"

"I'm sorry, but these pictures are just too good!" His siblings laughed.

"I hope you three are happy together!" Alex said sarcastically, walking out.

The next day we watched the parade as the turkey cooked.

After the parade, I asked Shannon, "Do you need any help with anything?"

"No, I think I'm all set, dear. Thank you, though."

"Mom doesn't let anyone help us with this meal, she is worried we will mess it up, even though she taught us how to cook." Said Mark.

"Because you hooligans would do something to mess this meal up!" She replied.

After a delicious dinner, I helped Shannon put clean up as the rest of the family went outside to play in the snow. We stood at the sink and watched through the window as they all played in the backyard.

"It rarely snows here, Mother Nature must've known you were coming and wanted you to feel at home." She said.

"I appreciate the thought, but I see enough snow as it is." I laughed. "But they seem to love it."

"Yes they do!" She said as she passed me a freshly cleaned bowl to dry.

"You know, I have never seen my Alex as happy as he is right now. It's obvious how much you love him and we can all tell how much of a difference it makes."

"I do love him, I love him so much."

"It shows. I mean, he's always been a happy and sweet boy, but now its just seems so much more natural."

"It feels very natural with him, I've never felt that way before."

"That's amazing, just promise you won't break his heart."

"I promise." 

We finished the dishes and joined the rest outside. Whelped the kids build snowmen and then had a snowball fight. It somehow ended up being the kids and Alex versus the rest of us.

"Don't even think about it!" I said as Alex aimed at me. He threw but I ducked. I quickly ran behind a snowman and then took aim. I got him right in the chest. His family cheered.

"Dang, your boyfriend's got an arm!" Lauren said.

All of a sudden Alex huddle up his nieces and nephews behind a tree. 

"What are they doing?" Asked Lauren's husband.

"Guys, prepare yourselves! They're plotting!" Said Mark.

All of a sudden they came out from behind the tree, each with two snowballs in their hands and ran directly at me. I tried t Mae a run for it but it was too late, I fell to the ground in submission as they hurled snowballs at me and then piled on top of me. I was laughing so hard I didn't even see Alex come up and take a huge snowball and drop it right on my stomach. Everyone laughed, well expect me as I was in shock. Then Alex joined in the pile and managed to get his face close to mine.

"Admit defeat!" He said.

"Never!" And soon my teammates were attacking their own children and grandchildren with snowballs, playfully of course.

Alex was the only one still on top of me as the kids retreated. "Guess we must continue."

"Wait, but first I want a kiss before we attack each other again."

"I'm not falling for that!" He rebutted.

"Fine, guess you'll have to kiss this then!" I said, tossing a pile of snow in his face and getting up from under him.

"You are so dead, Bryant!"

Having declared a truce, we all retreated inside for hot chocolate and a movie.

We flew back on Sunday afternoon. I had an amazing time getting to know his whole family and I felt even closer to him.

When we got back we showered and got settled on the couch to watch a Christmas movie.

I stared at him as he brought over hot chocolate, careful not to spill any. His red and black Christmas onesie is adorable on him, I can't help but smile.

"You look so cute in those pajamas."

"Really? Cause I was trying to go for sexy, baby." He said, putting down the mugs on the side table and sticking a sarcastic 'sexy' pose.

"Oh you're right, you look so sexy I need you to take it off right away and do me!" I jokingly gasped.

He jumped onto the couch and on top of me. "Oh, I can do that." He laughed.

I couldn't help but laugh as well. "Did you realize your Texan accent has gotten thicker since returning to Texas?" I laughed.

"Ha. Ha. At least I don't drive like a maniac, ya masshole. Plus, you're Boston accent just stays at a constant thickness!"

"Hey! I'm a great driver! And I don't have an accent!"

"Yeah, yeah, yeah, sure you don't." He rolled his eyes. "You damn New Englanders and you're 'no accents.'"

He got closer to me. "Are you gonna keep talking or can I kiss you now?" I asked.

He gave me another eye roll and smirked. Like an infamous Marlon Brando eye roll that was so hot. Then he leaned in and brushed his lips against mine, sweet and light, yet knee buckling powerful. When he released his lips from mine he repositioned so his head was laying on my lap. He started the movie as I played with his hair.

"Have I told you how much I love you?" I asked.

"Yes, but not hourly like you agreed to in the contract." He blurted. I slapped him lightly, but hard enough to get revenge. He laughed. "Yes, you have. And I love you too." He said, kissing the arm I had around his chest. "I love you too." He repeated, kissing my arm softly again.

***

The following Saturday I woke up with a leg and an arm wrapped around his body, keeping him close to me.

"Good morning." He said, kissing me.

"Good morning." I laughed a little "You're stubble is tickling me!" He buried his face in my neck and shook his head, making me laugh more.

"Like that?!" He asked. "Is it scratching you?!" He laughed.

"If you don't shave yourself, I'm gonna do it in the middle of the night!" I threatened.

"I don't want to shave, but I'll let you do it."

"...right now?"

"Only if I get a kiss after."

"Deal."

We walked into the bathroom and he lathered his face and part of his neck up. "Don't cut me." He said, smiling. I sat up on the counter between the two sinks and took his razor in my hand. He moved in closer, positioning his face infant of mine and his body between my legs that his off the counter.

"If I do a good job, will you let me shave your chest?" I teased.

"Hell no." He said. We both laughed.

"Good, cause I think its kinda sexy." He leaned in for a kiss.

"Hell no. Not until you are clean shaven, mister." He gave me puppy dog eyes. 

"Fine." He said, turning his head to let me begin.

I started from his short sideburn and slowly moved the razor across his skin. I repeated the motion, then cleaned the razor. While it was silent as I worked, the tension was heavy. There was something so sensual and so romantic about it as I worked on shaving him.

His eyes stayed focused on me. I had to not look directly into them or else I'd lose my focus and cut him. I cleaned up a few missed spots and then took a small hand-towel and dried him from the remaining shaving cream and water on his face.

"There. Much better." I said, finally looking him in the eyes.

"You're so sexy when you're focused." He smiled.

"I...I think you mean nervous." I said

"Why are you nervous?"

"Because I didn't want to cut you." I laughed.

"I appreciate that, but I think if you did id survive, especially since I'd have you."

God, he is so freaking sweet. I just need to know how invested he really is. "Where do you see our relationship going? Like are you serious? I mean, I don't know, I think you are. I just want to make sure." I spat all this out quickly.
