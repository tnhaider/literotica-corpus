 The story below is written with the intention of putting my fantasy down on paper (symbolic) and allowing others to enjoy it as much as I do. 

There are some conditions that must be met first though: 

a. You must be of legal age in which ever state, county, country or universe that you reside in. 

b. If you find graphic sex and detailed descriptions of sexual acts offensive, stop now. 

c. If you enjoy this type of story or like what you have read then keep an eye out for more. 

d. If you have comments or suggestions for future stories let me know, I'm open to ideas. 

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read the stories that I post. You readers are the reason that we writers exist. 

This work is copyrighted to the author Â© 2005. Please don't remove the author information or make any changes to this story. You may post freely to non-commercial "free" sites, or in the "free" area of commercial sites.

Thank you for your consideration.

My name is Bob and I've been living alone in a large two bedroom apartment for the past two years. I am single and am enjoying my life. I have a great three day a week job, which pays well. I am active in the local gym, enjoy bicycling and going out with my friends. I am also an avid nudist.

I was checking out the bulletin at the local Safeway, when I decided to place an ad for a roommate.

 Looking for roommate - male or female
21y to 35y non smoker non alcohol
Not offended by nudist lifestyle.
