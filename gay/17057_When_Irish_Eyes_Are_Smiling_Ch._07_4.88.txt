 Note to readers: We're just going to take a second here and thank Stella_Omega for her invaluable assistance in clearing the trees of undergrowth so that we could see the right path through the forest of possibilities. She truly is a valuable friend to have on your side. We'd also like to thank adetaildiva for her assistance in getting these last four chapters edited and posted. Her decision to be honest and shit on the changes that we'd made to this final chapter was what sent us off on a quest for the path we were clearly missing. We'd also like to thank all the people who proofread for us, blackhaus7 and slick_willie. I hope I spelled those right. *grin*

OK, enough kudos for now, y'all get to reading and see what becomes of our faithful heros. *wink*
