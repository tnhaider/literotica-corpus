Just a quick one to say we made it to the airport okay. And thanks for a great day :-)

My pleasure. What time's your flight?

I didn't think you'd get this til the morning! Flight is 4am. I only have email for another 5 minutes or so, though - I don't have a smartphone...

PS No you can't!! :-P

Hope this catches you then. Have a good flight - let me know when you're safely back in the UK?

PS I do - I'm emailing from bed :-) You've sent me to sleep with a smile x

I hate the universe sometimes. Here I am in my empty little room, alone and missing you so bad I can't sleep... If someone had said to me a year ago that I'd go travelling and meet the most amazing guy by total chance, and fall for him even though we only spent one day together, I would have said they were nuts. But they would have been right.

God, that's embarrassing. Put that last email down to me being tired, drunk and stupid - will you forget I sent it? Sorry.

I will if you want me to, but I kind of liked it. Even though you're clearly crazy :-)
I got home safe, anyway.
While I remember - you said something yesterday about looking me up online. I don't like the idea much but it's not like I can stop you. Will you promise me that you won't believe everything you read?

PS And if someone had said to me a year ago that I'd be getting ready to tell my dad that I've met a guy, well...

You mean you *didn't* have a threesome with the Olsen twins? Damn, I liked that story ;-)
What will you tell your dad about me? [acts nonchalant]

Oh, you know, nothing special. Just that meeting you turned my head upside down and made me re-think everything I thought I knew, and that I'll always be grateful that I met you.

I've just got back from an awards dinner. There was champagne [hic]
I'd start by doing some of the things I was too chicken to do yesterday... I want to know what you taste like.

Is Liege anywhere near Bruges? Will you see your family? What do you do on rest days? Do you really have to cycle 3300km?!?

So many questions... here's another one. Are you sure I should come to Madrid?

I like you asking questions!

It's about 200km, so my dad and my oldest sister will probably drive over to be at the stage finish. If I'm lucky I may even get to have dinner with them - I've not seen Lotte since Christmas, so that would be nice.

On rest days there's a recovery ride and a massage, and then I'm usually asleep, or in a coach, or in a coach trying to be asleep. I get travel-sick in coaches :-( It's not all yellow jerseys and champagne, you know.

Yes, I really do have to cycle 3300km - that's pretty average for a Grand Tour. At least it means I get to eat Pringles without worrying about getting fat :-)

Please come to Madrid. It'll be crazy, but I want to see you.
