 Jonathan stared out over the balcony railing into the garden below. His heart ached horrendously over the loss of his best friend. In his mind, he conjured memories of the past years with Peter that only proved to make his pain even colder and harder to bear. 

It seemed the vast darkness that surrounded him would quickly swallow him up. He felt caught in a vacuum of utter solitude and aloneness, so isolated now, as if no one could ever understand the pain and hurt he felt. And his mind kept going back to that night at the hospital, the words the man had spoken riveted through his being like glaciers sliding, frigid and heavily over ridges of icy walls.

Without warning it effused from his being. He gripped the railing tight leaning forward as he began to wail. Pain issued from his being with gut wrenching sounds that permeated the night, cutting through the silence like so many double-edged swords. It seemed to hang in the air, surrounding him unrelenting and heavy, tormented where the cries he made. His body shook violently, sweat beaded over his brow and upper lip. Tightly his fingers gripped the railing that caused the knuckles to blanch.

All he knew was the pain he felt and that he was utterly consumed with it. Soon, it became all he could do to stand there, as his legs becoming weak and slowly went to his knees, then finally sat on the cold concrete floor of the balcony. Grasping the vertical bars of the structure he leaned his cheek against one of them weeping soundly for a long time.
