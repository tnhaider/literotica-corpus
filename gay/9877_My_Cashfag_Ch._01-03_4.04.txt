 It was a Thursday night when I saw a post while browsing Facebook. Tom, that cute awkward little guy who was obsessed with me in highschool just became CEO in a real estate company.

Back in the day, he would stare at me all day while we were in class, he would go just to the parties I also went. That poor guy did everything I told him to, and he didn't even complained. He slipped a "thank you" one time I asked him to do my homework because I had 2 chicks going to my place.

I didn't bully him. To be honest, I was pretty nice with him. I didn't care if he showed a tent in his pants every time he came to say hi to the gym. I would even take my shirt off and flex in the mirror when he was there -quite obviously just for me-. I know fags can't help it. They worship real men, that's just how it is.

I grew kinder the last year of school. I even let him be my friend, sort of. We would hang out at my place, play videogames or talk about fucking girls (I would do most of the taking). He somehow always made it sound fair that he paid for the usual pizza and cleaned our mess. He was always eager to do that kind of stuff, like I was doing him a favor by letting him. I just went along with it and I ended up like the nice jock who was nice with the little guys. Points for me.

The last couple of weeks I started getting bored of him. It was always the same, he would just stare at me and drool. I tried to get rid of him by being mean but it didn't work, he was as happy as ever. I started giving commands, not asking nicely for stuff. 

-Go get me a beer from the fridge- I would say while he was doing my homework and I was playing video games. He immediately stood up and went get me one. 

I was used to him being "nice" but I didn't know how far this could go. I decided to find out.

He was cute and lame at the same time. I could always feel his eyes on me. I could sometimes smell his nervous sweat when he was close to me. He would get shaky and he would start combing his dark short hair with his hands when he talked to me. 

It wasn't that weird between us, anyone could have said we were good friends. Except we both knew I was letting him be around me. 

It was last week of classes, then we all would go to different places. I decided it was time to find his limit. He was working on my final project while I was sitting on the bed playing videogames with my feet hanging. I looked at him and as if it was his responsibility I said:

-My feet are aching.

-So...? - he said rather confused.

-Massage them. -I ordered while taking my shoes off.

I saw a glow in his eyes and he practically ran to my feet. He started rubbing them almost in trance. Taking his time with every single inch. His hands felt so respectful touching me... 

-Hey, have you seen this new show on - I immediately kicked his face with my bare feet. 

-Did I tell you to speak?

-No, sorry- He went all red and look down while he continued.

- Hey, I'm gonna order a steak from this new fancy place. Get me your wallet. You can have the pizza leftovers from yesterday. - He reached his back pocket without a second thought and handed me his money.

-Thank you, Sir. 

We both locked eyes in surprise, which was followed by me grinning and him getting more red than I thought possible. 

-This is gonna be a fun week...

Anyways, that's how it all started. Figure out the rest couple of days. We ended up in different schools and hadn't heard from him until now. 

There he is. His pretentious silly profile picture wearing a blue suit, like he was a respectable man. Like he even was a man. 

He sent me a friend request. After all I did to him, after everything I made him do for me back in the day. I grinned while accepting it and went to put my phone back in my pocket and grab a beer from my fridge. 

I didn't even had time for that when I got a message.

-Hey :)

-Sup

-I'm Tom, from high school. Remember me? 

-Sure I do, buddy. 

-What have you been up to?

Aaand that's enough, too boring. I left my phone there and went to take a shower, I was hoping to grab some chicks at the bar later. 

When I came back and checked my phone, I had a zillion messages. Yes, all from him. 

-Hey?

-You there?

-Phill

-Did something happened?

-Hey

-I just want to catch up

-I was really surprised to find you

-Hey

-???

-Wanna go get a coffee sometime?

-Ok, talk to you later :)

It was almost pitiful. Well it would have been if it weren't this fag Tom. He was probably hyped he was talking to Me. Even if I wasn't replying. I decided it wouldn't hurt to give him a chance.

-The new fancy restaurant between 2nd and 6th. Tomorrow 3pm?

-Arbani's? Sure, I'll be there. Looking forward to it!

-Sure buddy.

-Thank you.

That night I brought 2 girls to my flat. I'm sure he jerked off alone several times thinking about me.

********* 

It was already 3 when I was taking a shower. Not that I cared that he waited tho, I'd take all the time I want. I took an Uber and arrived at the place at 3:45.

I was lead to the table where he was, obviously, still waiting. There were a couple of empty glasses there, which meant he had been there a while. He stood up as soon as he saw me and his eyes shined a spark. 

-Hey Phill. How are you? - He stretched his hand to me. 

-I'm ok. Have you been waiting long? - I said while I totally ignored his trembling hand and just sat down (I wasn't starting being nice now). 

-Oh, it's my fault. I arrived early, I'm sorry.

-I know, it's ok.- I said with a smirk on my face as I saw his face getting blushed.

-You still keep your shape don't you?

- I guess I do, buddy. It's just natural for me, you know that.

The waiter came in and asked if he could take our order.

- Yes, I'm having an onion soup and a;

- I'll take whatever the most expensive dish on the menu is and the same with whine. He'll have just a plain salad and a glass of water, thank you.- I might as well go for it, right?

+Hum, Sir...?- he asked Tom with a weird look, looking for any kind of "normal" response as he was squirming in his chair.

- Y... yes, that's right. Thank you.- He answered as his eyes kept locked at the table just in front of him, incapable of any other response. I shrugged the waiter and continued.

-Tell me that's not why you're here. Tell me you don't crave serving Me. Look me in the eye and tell me.

He tried to go back, he tried to make it look like all this was casual friends meeting. But the moment he looked at my eyes, he had to look down again, he couldn't grasp a word. I could see the sweat drops falling down his cheeks and his fingers fidgeting on his lap.

It was so funny just looking at him struggling. He was buying Me dinner. He contacted me to serve, we both knew that. 

- Got a family?- I said without taking my eyes of him.

- A wife and two kids.- I kicked his leg under the table.

- Sorry?

- A wife and two kids, Sir.

- Oh, that's what I thought you said. Job? Yours and wife's

- I'm vice president in real estate, she stays home. 

- Isn't the sex good, boy? Why did you come running to Me?

- No, it is but...

- She won't have sex with you?

The waiter came back with the food. He gave a sad look at my steak and then to his salad.

-Any problem fag?

-N... No, Sir. -he started eating after me- the problem is not her, the thing is that I...

-You miss having no control over your life.

-He looked down, clearly ashamed of himself.

-And living just for my pleasure. You miss fulfilling your purpose in life.

-I... -Never had I thought someone could get that blushed.

-Hey. Tom. It's okay. -I said with my sweetest voice while I put my hand on his arm. -All of us have a destiny in life. Something that makes us feel really happy. I can help you with that, we're friends after all, aren't we? You don't have to be ashamed.

-Y...yeah

-Now. You'll make me happy, won't you? -He stopped to think for a few seconds and said yes with his head- There you go. It isn't that difficult. I'll do anything I can to help you out. Here, I can take your car today, give me your keys. -I said while I put my almost-finished food away and extended my open hand.

It was hilarious how he gave me the keys like I was making him a favor. Really pathetic. He even did it while trying to hide his boner. But oh well, fags can't help it. 

-I'll let you know when you're serving me next.

I stood up and started walking away.

-Hey Phill!- I stopped without looking at him- Thank you...- I grinned and left the place.

I drove home that night and, to be honest, I jerked off to the thought of taking every single thing he owned, make it mine and make him my house bitchboy. 

The thought of controlling all of him, from his bank account to having him wearing minimal clothes, using a chastity device and being no more that furniture in my house, doing every single thing he was commanded to... That's what made me cum. Of course I deserve that, why wouldn't I? I'm fucking perfect, this body and face is something people literally fall to their knees for. 

That's when I planned it. I'll take him. I'll break and humiliate him. I'll take away his will and do whatever the fuck I want with his miserable existence. He'll become just a mere extension of Me, a tool, a thing to be used. He'll be begging to kiss the ground I step on. 

I said why the fuck not. And texted the fagboy Tom I'll make all his entire existence revolving around me in no time. And he'll be so fucking thankful.

- Hey bitch, I want you to thank me for taking your car from you, it's mine now.-He took a minute but it finally came:

- Thank you Sir for letting me please a stud like You. Any other way I could serve you?- This just felt so natural. 

- Actually, yes. Make sure to be home alone tomorrow at 4:00 pm. Leave the door unlocked, be naked and blindfolded. If you're not willing to comply, just don't talk to me again. Obey and you'll be mine for life.
