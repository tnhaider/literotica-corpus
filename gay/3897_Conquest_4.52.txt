 In retrospect, I should've begun this story long ago. Saying it means a lot to me would be a stunning understatement. What you are about to embark upon is a story of discovery, opportunity and regret. Whilst sex is undeniably at the forefront of this story, I hope that you will appreciate the background of which it is told. To everyone who has ever been in love, the people who have experienced the joy and pain that comes along with it. This is for you.
