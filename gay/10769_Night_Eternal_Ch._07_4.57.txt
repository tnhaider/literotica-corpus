 You know all the usual stuff, don't read if it's illegal or you don't like sex or sex between two males offends you. All characters are purely fictional, and any likeness is a coincidence.

This is a story of two friends who after being apart from each other, discover a love between them they never knew could exist. Ryan thought Coby was dead, while Coby silently watched Ryan just out of reach. The separation had become maddening for both. They have just come together to start a new journey of discovery with each other.
