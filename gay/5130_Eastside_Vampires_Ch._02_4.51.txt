"Stop, feel, learn and live." said Jaden. I frowned at first, not understanding. Then for a second, I thought it made sense, that odd phrase that he said. I smiled up at him, just as he leaned in and bit down hard. His sharp fangs pierced my skin, I nearly screamed and my whole body stiffened with the pain. Just as quickly as he struck though, my body relaxed as my mind was caught up in a huge wave, raising higher and higher, causing a tingle of arousal to start up in my groin. "Fuck it..." I snapped weakly, unusually foul-mouthed with my overall shock at what was happening to me. I couldn't believe it. I could feel the pull on my life force as this creature in the shape of a man with ice-green eyes drew on my blood.

It was like I was hovering above myself and I was in my own body at the same time. I watched as he pulled away, but couldn't feel it. My body was limp, only held up by his hand pushing me back against the wall. When he pulled away, he gently allowed me to slump to the floor where I lay like I was paralyzed. 

I looked up into his eyes as he bent over my still form. He leaned down and licked my neck clean of blood droplets and smiled mysteriously in what seemed like approval? At about the same time, my vision began to fade. I vaguely felt a lifting sensation, and I watched from above myself as the man scooped me up into his arms with ease and left the alley. I noticed before he picked my body up, that the wound in my neck was knitting itself together, healing at an incredible speed. 

The moment he stepped outside the alley, there was a sucking sensation as I was drawn back to my own body, and then everything went black.

Sinking my fangs into the soft tissue of his neck had its desired effect. He initially fought me, clawing at my face and body, trying to break free, to escape the mind numbing jolt of pain that he was experiencing. This was brief, lasting mere seconds before a warm glow overwhelmed his body, filling his form with a sensation akin to pleasure but a variety of pleasure that he had never before experienced. 

I looked down into his young face as I felt his body crumble, holding his body weight easily when his legs went out from under him. I fed, drinking long and deep, savoring his taste and feeling my body grow strong as I drank his lifeblood.

I stopped before actually draining him, choosing instead to take him with me. Something about this young man appealed to me, I hadn't had a companion for a long time, and He would fill the position more than adequately.

Watching his eyes I waited until they closed before slowly pulling from his neck. I let my cool breathe wash over him and then licked and sucked his neck lightly to heal the puncture wound. He fell back then, succumbing to me, his body fully supported by mine, I noticed the beginning of his arousal, a bulge visible at the front of his pants and smiled to myself. I lifted him into my arms, cradling him against my chest and walked briskly from the dark alleyway.

Just outside the alley, parked on the side of the road was my black Ford Mustang, moonlight glinting off the chromed rims. I opened the passenger side door and carefully deposited the young man into the seat and strapped the seatbelt around him. Still smiling to myself I got into the driver's seat and drove in the direction of my house, located on the outskirts of town. 

Pulling into my driveway I killed the ignition and stepped from the car. I inhaled the cool night air, reveling in my renewed strength before lifting my guest from the vehicle and bringing him into the house. I laid him on the bed in the master bedroom while I ran some water in the tub and lit lamps inside the bathroom, which was adjoined, to the master bedroom.

I shivered internally; it was getting chilly. I thought I heard water running, but that would be odd. I live alone now, why would there be water running? I struggled to open my eyes. It was like trying to pry my eyes open. When I finally managed to open my eyes and look around, I realized it wasn't my room. I sat up too quickly, which set my head to spinning and I snapped my eyes shut again to stop the spinning. When the nauseating feeling subsided, I opened my eyes to try and get a bearing on where I was. 

The room was sparsely furnished and I was lying on a large four-poster bed. A small lamp on a bedside table provided light. There were two doors, both closed, though one had light shining through the crack along the bottom. I could still hear running water coming from somewhere. An amused voice said, "So, you're finally awake. Just in time.

The deep, ornate tub filled slowly. A scented steam wafted through the bathroom, looking almost like a misty vapor in the lamplight. Leaving the tub to fill I returned to the bedroom and sat on the edge of the four-poster bed, waiting for my guest to regain consciousness.

I stared down into the young man's face, noting his almost haggard features. Not old by any means but worn and newly wise, angry for sure. Someone had dealt him a hard emotional blow and recently by the looks of him. I searched his outer mind, the part that carries our newest memories and feelings. I was right; he had suffered a hurt, a slight that would make any young man, or woman, for that matter, bitter and angry at the world.

I knew that the tub was almost full and decided to wake him. I reached down, letting my fingers trail across his lower jaw, up a little to touch his lips and caress his cheek. His eyes flickered, once, twice as he struggled to focus, his hands came up to rub at his face. I spoke to him quietly, making him aware of my presence. In a moment of panic he almost leaped from the bed when his eyes came to rest on me. I put a restraining hand on his shoulder when he did this, keeping him firmly and securely placed on the bed.

"Don't struggle Jaxon, it would be rude to refuse my hospitality and I don't take kindly to rudeness. Take off your clothes and follow me into the bathroom. Do as I say now and do it silently, you will have ample opportunity to ask questions and voice your concerns later."

I stood for about thirty seconds beside the bed, watching him struggle with his emotions, his thoughts painted clearly across his face. 

"I said, do it now!"

I struggled internally, trying to decide whether or not to listen to him. I took some time to think, scratching my chin, then my hand moved down to my neck where it was kind of itchy too. Suddenly, memories came flooding back to me about what happened.

"No! I'm not going to do that... you... you BIT me!!!" I scrambled backwards on the bed in an angry panic, "It hurt. I was bleeding. It was NOT a dream." I felt my neck all over. Aside from a small patch that was tender to the touch, it seemed to be entirely intact. "You freak! What the hell did you do to me?" This seemed too surreal to be true.

He stood impassively at the foot of the bed for a brief moment before lunging forward and using his body weight to pin me to the bed. Before I could react, he snaked forward an arm with amazing speed, pushing my head back so that my neck was exposed to him. "You'll do what I say," he said, leaning in closer. My eyes were riveted to his, mesmerizing pale and ice-green, just inches away from mine. "Or I'll just take what I want." he finished. He lightly stroked the back of his finger over the tender spot on my neck and a shivery tingle made my entire body shudder with something I couldn't quite identify. My eyes glazed a bit and involuntarily I relaxed ever so slightly. He did it again. "I want you to take your clothes off and follow me into the bathroom."

When he finally shifted his gaze, I looked dazedly down at my clothes. Why were they still on me? I got up off the bed and slowly took them off, dropping them unceremoniously onto the hardwood floor. Jaden lay on the bed, watching with a lazy, self-satisfied smile.

I watched Jaxon as he removed his clothes, his lean body coming into view. His abs rippled when he lifted his t-shirt above his head and I took a sharp breath. I lazily stroked my chest as I lay on the bed waiting for him to finish. The expression on his face was full of confusion; I could hear his thoughts as they shifted from apprehension to full compliance. He wanted to listen to me, he didn't understand why but he wanted to just the same.

As Jaxon dropped his final article of clothing I got up from the bed and crossed the room to stand in front of him. I looked him over from head to toe, he was more than attractive, and he made me ravenous but this time in a purely sexual way. I felt my arousal increase tenfold as I dropped my eyes to rest on his sex. Maintaining eye contact with him, allowing my desire to flood his senses I placed my hands on his chest, slowly running the tips of my fingers down his body, circling his stiffening nipples. I felt my need begin to get away from me; it had been so long, too long since I had been satisfied sexually. Bending my head a little I leaned into him and licked his slightly moist neck, tasting him. He groaned quietly his hands coming to rest against my shoulders, I saw his cock jerk and harden. I looked up into his questioning eyes, knowing he was probably even more confused now; I tried to ease his mind, make him understand. 

"Jaxon, don't be afraid, do only as I tell you, its what you want, its what I need, its ultimately what will happen."

Bending my head, my hands still on his chest, I was able to monitor both his heartbeat and his emotions as I covered his mouth with mine. I was able to taste his very essence as I explored his mouth; he reciprocated in kind, our tongues dueling in an intricate dance, our breathing quickening and deepening, chests heaving. Pushing him back towards the bed I removed my shirt, each button popping slowly, my eyes never leaving his. By the time the backs of his knees connected with the bed I had dropped my shirt to the floor and was unbuckling my belt, opening the button of my jeans and unzipping. I let my pants slide off my hips stepping out of them when they pooled on the ground.

Seemingly gentle but with a controlled force I lay his body back onto the bed, I inhaled his scent, his excitement and fear seemed to course through my veins urging me on, fueling my inner fire. The bath forgotten for the moment I lay down atop of him, grinding myself against him, kissing him deeply now as I felt him respond, his body pushing back against me, a low growl escaping his mouth. A thin layer of sweat covered us both as we played out this scene, I wanted to possess him, make him mine, body and soul.

The room felt electrically charged and I could almost feel my skin prickling with the energy building with each piece of clothing I removed. Why was I listening to him and doing what he said? When Jaden got off the bed and came up to me, the instant he laid his hands on me, I could feel something more was building. I followed the trail of his fingers with my eyes, watching as they slowly traced their way down my body, shivering when he touched particularly sensitive areas. I groaned when he licked the light beads of perspiration away from my neck, putting my hands on his shoulders and holding him off. Why was he doing this to me? I asked with my eyes. My body burned with arousal the same way my mind burned with questions that my mouth couldn't put into words.

"Jaxon, don't be afraid, do only as I tell you, its what you want, its what I need, its ultimately what will happen." How did he know what I wanted? I thought rebelliously, since my mouth still didn't seem to want to coordinate with my brain yet. He kept his hands on my chest, brushing his lips over mine. I was suprised at myself when I responded, parting my lips slightly to let his tongue in to explore my mouth. 

He pushed me back towards the bed, stripping as he herded me along till I touched the bed. I couldn't keep my eyes off his body. It was lean and hard, his muscles were clearly defined under his slightly flushed skin. A physical example of perfection in a male body, to be sure. Jaden leaned in towards me and I bent back to keep my personal space, until I was laid flat on the bed, nowhere to go. He laid down on top of me, pinning me to the bed and rotated his hips in a deliberate circle, grinding against me. I growled, I was hard as rock, but why?

I arched up to test how much of his weight he was laying on me. I considered, then put my hands at his shoulders, and heaved up again, intending to roll him off me. I don't know how, but he ended up on top again, but now he was straddling my stomach, holding my wrists above my head. He narrowed his eyes at his hands, muttering something under his breath in another language, then took his hands away. I struggled hard, but my hands were firmly being held in place by something invisible. "I warned you, Jaxon" he said, looking like a sweaty young god, "What I need, I'll take if you won't give."

He tried to test me, I knew he would and I smiled inwardly. This only served to increase my desire for me; I wouldn't want a pathetic human creature that only did as I asked.

Once I had him securely immobilized, his hands now fastened, albeit invisibly to the bed, I began my seduction of his body. Sliding slowly down his heated body I tasted him with my tongue, licking at his skin, circling an erect nipple before drawing it into my mouth. Continuing down his form I glanced up at him, he was watching my every move through hungry eyes.

"I told you Jaxon, there's no use fighting me, I already know you, understand your needs, your wants, your fears, now comes the time for you to understand mine."

Slipping off the end of the bed, I spread his legs wide, inhaling his musky scent. Bending my head I kissed my way up his inner thighs, lightly licking the sensitive skin, feeling his body arch toward my mouth, hearing the low groans of desire escape his mouth as I teased him. Nearing his arousal, evident now, his cock slick at the tip with early precum I swiped my tongue along his length, almost to the head of his cock but not quite, then down again to his firm sac, running over the skin but not giving him the pressure that I knew he desired.

"What do you want Jaxon, tell me, I want to hear you say it?"
