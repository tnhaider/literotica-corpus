Chapter Seventeen

Guy was going insane. He had gallons of adrenaline running through his system and nothing to do but sit there staring at taillights.

He could sense Mel. He knew, of course, that his mate was at the church, not too many miles away, but it felt like he would have known where Mel was even without the GPS tracking information. He could feel his life force. He could feel his emotions. Some part very deep inside himself was bonded with Mel and he knew—knew for a fact—that his mate was terrified.

As he fought to maintain control over the thinking part of his brain, he suddenly felt pain. It wasn't in his own body; it was Mel's pain. He couldn't tell where the pain was or what had happened to him, but he knew Mel had been hurt.

A feeling so powerful he could not have fought it if he'd tried exploded within him. Kill! He needed to get to his mate immediately and kill whoever was hurting him.
