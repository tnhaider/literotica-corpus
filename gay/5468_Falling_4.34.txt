 The British summer air was cool and crisp. Charlie inhaled deeply and sighed as he breathed out; opening his eyes he drank in the piercing blue sky. A smile carved its way across his face, only Charlie knew about this place buried in the woods. He had stumbled across this haven when he lost his way jogging as a teenager. The first time he found this place he had lay down and stared at the sky until the stars came out to shine. He didn't want to leave but he had to if he was going to make it to work on time. With a heavy heart Charlie left, already thinking about the next time he would return.
