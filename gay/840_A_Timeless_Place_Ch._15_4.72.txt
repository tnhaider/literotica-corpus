 "Uh," Greg was completely taken aback by the gesture, searching his mind for a verbal response. Bruce took advantage of the moment, leaned his head to one side and filled Greg's slightly open mouth this his tongue.

Instantly, the doctor took him into his arms, not giving any kind of protest whatsoever. He latched onto the man aggressively, pressing his entire body against Bruce firmly. Their tongues danced with the others in a sense of struggle for dominance. But in Bruce's arms Greg was always submissive, yielding to the man whatever he desired of the doctor.

"Lose the gloves, Greg," Bruce pulled back only enough to whisper to the doctor. 

"Oh," Greg detached from him, taking them off, habitually allowing the one glove to turn inside out. As he pulled off the remaining one, he turned the glove inside out with the first one stuffed in the palm. He tossed them into the trash receptacle between the bed and the nightstand nearby. 

Immediately, Bruce slipped his arms around Greg's waist, pulling the doctor as close to his body as possible. Inertly, he leaned his head down brushing his lips to Greg's lightly producing a soft moan from the expectant man. It seemed to them that it had been an eternity since they had made love to each other. The remembrance of that morning he had taken Greg to work in the car returned.
