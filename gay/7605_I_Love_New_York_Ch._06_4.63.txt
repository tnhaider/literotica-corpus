 Hey guys! Chapter six of ILNY, cutting very, very close to the end of the series! Devon is pretty much on an emotional roller coaster between the guilt he feels with Gavin and his euphoria when he's with Kayden, and I try to make that clear in this chapter. I want to give a massive thanks to cannd, who left a SUPER inspiring comment on chapter four, parts of which inspired some of Devon's dialogue in this chapter. 

Also, I'm getting a lot of suggestions on Gavin's HEA, and some of them are very creative. Thank you for them, and keep the feedback coming. I'm not sure yet when I'll be writing his HEA, because I think I may take a break from the gay male cat for a while and work on a story for ILNY's own Cassidee. Still haven't made any decisions on that yet. I'll be sure to keep you posted!

Anywhore, I'll stop rambling now. Enjoy.
