 WHAT I'M *NOT* LOOKING FOR IN COMMENTS/REVIEWS:

*Critique/criticism of my writing style-I'm comfortable with my style (wordiness and all), so if you find it not to your liking, you're welome to try out something else.

*Publication advice-I'm not trying to get published, so advice on how to make a piece publication worthy is not necessary.

*Sarcasm or rudeness-this speaks for itself.

WHAT I *AM* LOOKING FOR IN COMMENTS/REVIEWS:

*Notice of typos/spelling/grammar errors-I will strive to fix these immediately!

*Notice of discrepancies or plotholes-I might not be able to fix these so easily, but if I'm informed of them, I can at least make note of them in the disclaimers.

*What the reader enjoyed about the story-I'm not so thrilled to hear what the reader didn't enjoy, but as long as it's presented tactfully (and isn't solely about writing style), I can try to bear it. *blushes*

I write and share my work mainly to entertain others, so I always enjoy knowing when I've succeeded. :)
