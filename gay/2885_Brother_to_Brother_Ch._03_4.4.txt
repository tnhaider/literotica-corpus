 Chapter 3- The kiss that started it all

DISCLAIMER: This story is a work of fiction. All characters involved are eighteen years of age or older. This series will include sex between brothers. Do not continue reading if you do not approve of incestuous relationships. Again, this work is fiction.

I'm going to be writing these next chapters from both perspectives to allow Carter and Aiden's inner thoughts to be well known. I hope you guys like the new format and can keep up with the story like this. Also, I plan on keeping the story at this pace; I don't want to rush it, so please just bear with me. I usually upload a new chapter right when the previous one is approved.
