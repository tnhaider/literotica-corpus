On July 8, Pauletta approached the entrance to The Purple Knight, his favorite bar in the Castro District of San Francisco. He stopped to read a notice on the door, which said: 

 ATTENTIONS TO OUR PATRONS

In honor of National Nude day, July 14, 2011

This establishment will hold a

"Clothing Optional" night on Friday, July 15.

All patrons will be allowed to wear as much or as 

little clothing as they choose. You may strip to the buff

upon entering that night, or leave on all your clothing.

The Management of THE PURPLE KNIGHT strongly endorses

sexual freedom, and you are free to do as you wish.
