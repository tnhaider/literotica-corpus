 Brian "Beef" Carroway thinks he's gay. No, he knows he is. He's gruff, buff, and overcompensating for his big size and soft heart. Brian's the badass bouncer at Mosh rock club where Cajun singer Jack Cotille moonlights for the month of December.

With a voice like sin, Jack is walking, talking, sexy temptation in the flesh. He's also fly-by-night, possibly homeless, and chancing everything on a wing and a prayer. Just about the only thing Brian is sure of is traveling man Jack belts out dirty rock lyrics while promising the kind of pornographic sex he's only fantasized about.

He's definitely gay for Jack.

One Christmas kiss leads to a night of heaven, a morning of hell. The holiday week leaves Brian aching for more than his wanderer singer can give as the New Year's Eve countdown begins.
