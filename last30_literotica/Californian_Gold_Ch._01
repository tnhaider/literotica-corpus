 “Alex! Its time to get up! You’re going to be late for your flight!” My mother’s voice called from downstairs. I could hear the sadness in it, although she was doing her best to be chipper and stay calm. It was enough to get me to bounce up from my bed, and toss on a white short sleeve t shirt, along with my favorite red hoodie, that had a black spider-man logo on the front. Grabbing my black and pink book bag, that had clothes and my sketchbook in it, I ran out of my bedroom, slipping on my boots as I fell down the steps.

“Ow.” Sitting up, I could hear my mother laughing as I tied my boots. “You shouldn’t have tried hoping down while getting them on.” I could hear the worry in her voice, wanting to make sure I was okay, but I just let out a soft chuckle. “Yeah yeah, I know. Im just excited. I finally get to see dad after ten years!” I knew this upset her, as she didn’t care much for my dad at all. “And I also get to see my little sis! You know how amazing this is?!”

“But you have a sister here. And you don’t spend any time with her.” My mom always tried to make me want to stay and do things I didn’t want to. She was the fixer. “I try but you know she hates me. If you ever find out why, let me know.” My voice broke a bit. I always wanted a sister who cared for me and wanted to spend time with me, but as she grew up, she started wanting nothing to do with me. The only time she wanted to spend time with me, is when she wanted something from me. “I know, son. Its just,” she paused and shook her head, her short blonde hair trying to swing back and forth. 

“I get it mom. Ill give you a call when I get to the airport, when the flight leaves, and when I land down.” This broke her. She started balling and pulled me into a tight hug, keeping my slim and athletic body pressed against her rather large one. “I’ll miss you. You know I love you and I always will. You better call me everyday.” 

I couldn’t hold back my tears anymore. I never really knew my dad, and to be leaving my mom, the only caring person I had left after my grandmother passed away, broke my heart. “I know. I love you mom. Ill be back soon to visit. You have my word.”

As I pulled away and walked out of the house, the tears finally started pouring. “Tell your dad if he doesn’t take care of you, I will fly out there and kick his ass!”

I arrived in Ontario, California three days later. The three days were hell. Had to wait one whole day in Denver, with no money, no food, no place to stay except the airport, for a whole day. I was finally here though. Just a little drive from Hesperia. 

My dad and his wife picked me up from the airport. The ride was eating me alive. You see, a few months back I was in an accident, where the brakes of my mother’s truck stopped working as soon as I started going down a steep hill. By the time I reached the bottom, I was going roughly sixty miles an hour, and slammed into a trailer head first. 

The doctor said I would never walk again due to a fracture in my spine. That was the only injury I acquired however. I had brain bleeding and a broken ankle.

Ever since that day, I have hated being in vehicles. It gave me panic attacks and bad anxiety, so I was glad when we finally reached my new home. 

It only took me thirty minutes to unpack my stuff, since I only had my book bag. When I was done unpacking, I walked out to the living room to see my dad, and his wife, walking out the door, to take off and go do their own thing. I knew they were heading to Vegas for a week, which is why I got here when I did. I didn’t mind however, as it gave me time to meet and get to know my half-sister, Dakota.

“Dakota?” I wondered where she was since I didn’t get an answer. First I knocked on the room to her door, but got no response. So my next place to look would be outside.

Opening the back door, I spotted a sliver of light coming from the building out back. “That must be where she is.” It was the only logical place I came up with since she wasn’t inside the house.

Opening the sliding glass door, I walked in, and peeked into the room that sliver of light was coming from, and sure enough, she was in there. But...I didn’t expect to see what I did. 

The slim brown haired girl was in there, music blaring. He panties were down at her ankles and her legs were spread. I could see everything. How she pumped her fingers in and out of her tight, dripping wet, pussy, rubbing her palm against her clit. “Holy shit...” I wanted to look away, I knew it was wrong to watch my half sister fuck herself with her hand, but I couldn’t. It didn’t take long before I heard her let out a moan, her breath shakey, and juices fly into the air, hitting the wall. 

Not only was the sight something to behold, but the smell that finally hit me in the face, made me let out a deep breath of satisfaction. There was only one substance in the world that had this smell...weed. 

Knocking on the door, I moved from the crack, and stood behind it. “Dakota? Are you in there?” I could hear rummaging and shifting. “Yeah. Come on in.” 

Nodding, to myself, I opened the door, to see her black hoodie covering her lap, with a small pipe on the jacket. “Hey sis.” Her eyes widened, and I swear she forgot about being naked under that jacket, as she got up, I was embraced in such a tight hug, I was amazed at how she didn’t know I saw her fingering herself just a minute before.

“Bro!” I could tell she was happy to see me, excited to finally meet me, after twenty one years of not knowing I existed. All I could do was chuckle and return the hug that she didn’t release. “Its nice to meet you.” I whispered softly, rubbing her back gently. 

“You too!” After what felt like forever of having her small frame, and breasts pressed against me, she released the hug, sitting in the chair infront of me. “Sit! Oh! Do you smoke?”

Smiling, I sat down across from her, trying to keep my eyes from looking under the table at her crotch. “I do. Got any? I could smell it from outside.”

After spending the whole night talking, laughing and throwing stuff, playfully, at one another, the sun finally rose. And she finally realized that if I wanted to, I could have looked at her cunt at any time, and wrapped her jacket around her waist to cover it. She figured I didn’t steal a few peeks, which I did, but wouldn’t tell her.
