 Disclaimers and thoughts. 

First an apology for my last story. I fully intended to state that it was going to be in two parts, primarily due to the length and forgot to put that in the title or description. Sorry.

This story is a long one, unlike others I have written there is an end and there is no invitation for someone to add to it. It is a story of a marriage that is failing and how the hero found out and what he then did. For the BTB crowd there is no violence or burning the bitch or bastard.

The story is fully finished and will be posted one part at a time, total of five parts, over the next few days so suggestions on how to proceed will be ignored. Please write your own story if you feel differently about how this one proceeds. For the ones who hate that a good man would ever be cheated on, I am sorry to inform you that good people sometimes get shit on by life. It happens all the time. A good woman, true to her vows, will somewhere in this great nation find out her husband is out fucking around today. Just stating the facts. By the way this is a fiction, not a factual accounting of a real event.

*****

It had started out to be a good day. Not a great day but a good day. Sam Morse was attending his granddaughter's third birthday party. His wife, Linda, and their daughter, Cindy Welton, had decided to hold the birthday party at a kid's venue in town.

Cinda, his granddaughter, and only grandchild, was having a great time playing with the older toddlers at the venue. Besides Sam, Linda and Cindy there was Sam's mother, Mary Morse, the seventy-eight year old matron of the family, Cindy's husband, Doug Welton, Sam's older brother, James, his wife, Deena, and Sam's sister, Darla Green, and a good family friend, Charlie Wink.

Charlie was always invited to family events even though he was not a blood relation as he had no family of his own since his wife had died a few years ago after a valiant fight with cancer. He and his wife had been great friends of the Morse's for years. 

Sam was sitting at the end of the table listening to the massive noise from the kids playing on the various equipment designed to give freedom of expression without fear of injury. He was also trying to hear some of the conversation between the other adults attending the party but there were a few empty chairs between him and them.

Overall Sam was satisfied. He was just fifty-three and was looking at early retirement. His pension was invested in such a way that he should not outlive it and he and Linda would not have to change their standard of living. His business was doing very well and promised to provide an adequate income also with the chance of a windfall if the business was merged with another firm.

As a matter of fact he was planning on announcing his retirement here at the birthday party after Cinda got her cake to messily eat and after her presents were opened. It was her day first after all. 

Sam was ready. He had been busting his ass, his balls, his back, and whatever else he could to make the company grow and now it was where he wanted it to be and he was ready to slow down and enjoy his wife and family. 

He was very satisfied with his life so far. His stock brokerage firm was well positioned. It would continue to be successful for many years without any change in direction but was also positioned to be worth many millions should a larger firm want to acquire it. Sam intended to become the chairman of the board and thus would still be keeping his finger on the pulse of the company but others would do the heavy lifting and make the money.

He was healthy but a little out of shape and overweight. That would have to be rectified now that he could start to take time to get back into shape. He looked over at Charlie. Yes, that was the shape he needed to aspire to. Charlie was close in age to Sam and Linda but looked years younger. It was obvious he kept in shape. Maybe Sam would ask Charlie to recommend a personal trainer.

Linda was also in good shape. She had just turned fifty-one and had a membership at the same gym that Charlie used. She stood only five foot four inches in height but was all woman. Her hair was dyed a nice brunette shade and she looked at least ten to fifteen years younger than Sam instead of two years younger. She only sported a "B" cup breast size and had agonized in her teen and college years about how she had been short-changed in the asset department but now was glad since her lovely assets had not succumbed much to gravity unlike some of her close friends. They complained constantly about how their breasts were "pointing at the floor instead of the ceiling." Linda's ass was tight and her legs were in good proportion to her height and torso. She could rock jeans, skirts or dresses without trying. And she loved sex. She loved all forms of sex, oral, vaginal and on rare occasions, anal. As a young woman she had even liked bondage and light spanking and pinching of her nipples and vaginal lips. Their lovemaking had slowed a little over time but that might be more Sam's fault than hers. He planned on changing that little fact soon.

Linda had been educated as an accountant, but with the demands on Sam at the brokerage firm she had decided early to be Cindy's mother full time and then use any extra time to volunteer for various organizations. Her accounting skills had helped a lot of charitable entities keep out of trouble with the IRS and also save money not having to hire outside accountants to go through the books.

Cindy didn't need her mother as much as she was now a mother herself. She and Doug had been married now for five years and Cinda was deemed to be the first of many children. Doug was a good man who had worked at Sam's office since graduating with a finance degree when he was twenty-three. In time he might even become CEO. At twenty-eight he was still a little green but he was a person with a thirst for experience and education and would soon be ready for promotion.

Cinda was a fantastic little girl. She was a walking, actually running most of the time, talking precocious little girl. Sam loved to watch her play.

Yes Sam was pleased with his life except something kept niggling at his brain. As he sat there and watched the rest of the family he started to notice that he wasn't included in the conversations at the table. Was it just the empty chairs between him and the rest or something else? He started to focus on what he could hear despite the noise of the kids playing. 

Linda was leaning close to Charlie to hear what he was saying. If you were a stranger looking on the scene you would assume that Linda and Charlie were the couple and Sam was the outsider. Sam was shaken at the thought that coalesced. He couldn't see where Linda's hand was but her position made it seem that she was resting her hand on Charlie's thigh as she leaned in close.

Sam's mother, Mary, was looking at the couple with an approving look on her face. Cindy and Doug were also not showing any concern at the closeness of Linda and Charlie. Sam looked at the other end of the table at his brother, James. James took that moment to look up at Sam and gave him kind of a smirk. James' wife, Deena didn't seem to be aware of any undercurrents at the table but was concentrating on listening.

Sam didn't start and grow his company by leaping to conclusions and losing his temper but he was concerned and needed to have those concerns addressed. He then looked at his sister and she was watching his expressions. Darla Green was a widow and Sam had tried to set her up with Charlie but nothing really clicked with the pair. Darla was very perceptive and could read Sam like a book. She made a quick shushing motion with her lips and a slight nod of her head. 

The day became a cloudy one with a sudden feeling of impending doom when Cinda came running back to the table and bypassed her grandfather and went straight to Charlie to be lifted up and held.

Sam couldn't keep his expression neutral. Suddenly his world felt on the edge of disaster. Realizing that he might be on the outside looking in was an epiphany. When had this happened? Yes, he was a driven business man but he had never neglected his family. He had made sure to attend all important family events including being at the beck and call of his mother. She had refused to move from the family home after Sam's father had passed, so Sam became the go-to guy to get necessary maintenance and repairs done. Of course she had a limited budget so most of the repairs had been paid for by Sam. Sam made much more money than James or Darla so he had never really minded being the family bank.

Sometimes it was a little grating when it seemed his mother would only contact him when she needed something done or paid for. He had never been very close to her. He was very much more like and had been friendlier with his father but his father had passed away many years ago.

Sam leaned back and contemplated some more. When was the last time he had taken Linda out for supper or a romantic date or even a movie? He couldn't remember. They still shared a bed but at five foot nine inches tall and tipping the scale at 210 pounds Sam wasn't the lover he had been in his younger days. His hair was gray now instead of the dark brown of his youth. His brown eyes were still clear and not cloudy with cataracts or other maladies of aging. Actually his vision was still so good that he needed neither glasses nor contacts.

Suddenly he decided to withhold his retirement announcement. He was still going to retire but maybe it would not be a welcome news item for his family.

He endured the rest of the party. After the cake and ice cream the presents were opened. Cinda was then drooping so Cindy and Doug made their way home with the tired little girl. Sam wondered if he would ever hold his granddaughter again. She had kept away from him the entire afternoon but had made Charlie her seat while indulging in her cake and small bowl of ice cream. Charlie was laughingly showing the stains in his clothes from the little girl he called "My granddaughter."

Even James looked up in surprise when Charlie announced that little tidbit. Sam's mother didn't seem to mind his statement though. Sam just shook his head.

Darla and Mary had ridden with James and his wife so they then took their leave together. That just left Sam, Linda and Charlie in the still noisy room. Linda now moved a little bit away from Charlie but was still closer to him than Sam. Sam decided enough was enough for the day and stood up. "Linda, are you going to ride with me or do you need to do something with Charlie?"

Linda started and gave Sam a guilty look before forcing her face to become neutral again. "Actually Charlie and I have some things to discuss about the Dementia Society fund raiser that kicks off next week. Charlie and I are on the fund raising committee."

She made sure that it all sounded innocent and plausible. When had that changed? Sam could not think of anything that would suggest a changing relationship between Linda and Charlie. Charlie was always over at their house since his wife died. Sam and Charlie even played golf every weekend when the weather permitted. They had been friends forever.

Charlie always seemed to have spare time to help with the charitable organizations, not quite as many as Linda, but enough so that they could be working close together. Sam just needed to discover how close they were otherwise. Was it an emotional affair or was it both emotional and physical? Could he forgive and carry on with his marriage?

Instead of voicing his thoughts Sam just nodded and turned and left the building. He moved his car to a different spot in the large parking lot. He would be able to see the door from there. His thoughts were filled with the speculations running rampant. Had they fucked in his bed? Did Cindy and Doug know? If Doug knew then how many at the office also knew and were intent on keeping Sam in the dark?

Did the rest of Sam's family know? He could actually see his mother accepting and even encouraging the affair. She had never seemed to like Sam even when he was a child. He was the youngest and spent a lot of his time at his grandparents since James and Darla were in high school before he was old enough for elementary school and he had spent most vacations with his grandparents unless his dad was home.

James had noticed something but Sam hoped he would not approve of Linda's affair. Darla he knew would not tolerate any hanky-panky. She had dumped friends when it was found out that they were seeking extramarital relationships.

Then came the big question. Why was Cinda so familiar with Charlie versus Sam? He was going to have to question his daughter and he wasn't looking forward to that conversation.

Soon he watched Charlie and Linda leave the venue. They were walking hand in hand to Charlie's car and even paused for a kiss before Charlie handed Linda into the passenger seat and then went around to the driver's side. As they left the lot Sam waited a bit and then followed. They just went straight to Charlie's house and pulled into the garage. Of course this could all be innocent. Linda and Sam had spent many an evening at the Wink residence over the years.

No other cars arrived. Were they a committee of two? Sam tried Linda's cell phone. It went directly to voicemail. Either it was off or she was using the phone. Didn't prove a thing. Sam made a mental note to check their records to see if Linda was using the phone at this moment.

Sam could not see any way he could approach the house. It was a mild afternoon and many of the neighbors were outside. A skulking male would attract too much attention. He decided to go on home.

After arriving there he got himself a stiff drink and sipped it while dreaming up various plans and discarding them. Divorce would be too much of a reward for hanging horns on him. Linda would get at least fifty percent of everything they owned and they owned a lot. Sam wouldn't be destitute or living in a cardboard box but it rankled him that the money he had so faithfully and tirelessly worked for would be given to Linda in reward for fucking around on him.

If she had just come and told him that she had developed feelings for Charlie Sam would have been hurt but would have appreciated honesty. He would have gladly given her whatever she wanted, within reason of course. No, sneaking around and fucking Charlie was not going to be rewarded.

After finishing his drink he decided that he could not get drunk. Drunk and out of control would not be the way to confront Linda.

He made his way up stairs to the master bedroom and changed into a swim suit. Their large house had a den and family room along with the formal living room and kitchen and two bathrooms on the main floor and four bedrooms upstairs, each with its own bathroom. They had a large garage that was attached to the main house and had a large storage room above the garage that could easily be converted into the proverbial mother-in-law apartment if needed. He had always planned on his mother, Mary, moving in or Linda's parents should they need care.

There was a large pool and hot tub area just outside the patio door and a small cabana type pool house also. Extra towels were stored there and Sam would leave his suit there. They had day help that kept the property clean and well maintained.

Sam went down and started his goal of getting into better shape. He swam, he treaded water, he walked in the shallow end and he thought and continued to plan and discard plans.

After an hour he was exhausted. Ruefully he wondered if Linda was as exhausted as he was. He decided he didn't have the time to care much. He then went to the pool house and showered, put on a robe and then went to the house and got dressed.

Now he sat down and actually put pen to paper. Unlike many other couples he and Linda only had a couple of credit cards. They seldom used them except when traveling. You had to have a credit card then. They would pay off the total when arriving home. The only thing he could do to make Linda unhappy would be to lower the limit but that wouldn't pose much of a limit on someone who didn't use credit very often.

Monday he would hire an investigator and get the ball rolling there. He needed answers yet and verification would be hard without a PI getting involved. He would check with one of his staff attorneys for a referral for a shark. He wasn't looking to make Linda destitute but he needed a shark to protect him from getting robbed blind.

He had purchased tickets for Linda and himself to travel across the pond for a renewal of their relationship post work. He figured the tickets would be nonrefundable so maybe his P.A. and his secretary, they were in a lesbian relationship, would like to take a honeymoon on his dime.

He was a wizard at finances so moving some of his money would have to be done. Also, he would have to make sure that the corporation had no shares in Linda's name. Maybe if they split up her half of the estate would be shares in the company. She could sell them off if she desired. He would make sure someone else, a friend or distant relative would have enough shares to keep her from controlling the company. That really didn't bother him much as he believed she would not try to harm him financially by destroying the company. No, he just needed to protect himself.

Since Cindy and, thus, Doug seemed to know about the affair she would not get a dime or any shares of stock more than they currently had and that wasn't much. No, the plan had been to reward everyone, even his siblings and his mother, this Christmas but not anymore.

Thinking of Doug, Sam made another decision. He had planned on starting him on the path to leadership but now Doug would be one of the people on the outside looking in. No, he wouldn't fire his son-in-law but he could guarantee that Doug didn't rise any further in the firm.

He vowed to set up a trust fund to assure college money for Cinda and any future grandchildren. They would not be hurt by the fallout.

He had a good outline of financial goals for the family. He chuckled about how his mother might be offended when she realized that the Bank of Morse had gone out of business. That would piss her off more than the thought that Sam would not be talking to her ever again on this green earth if he found out that she was knowledgeable and was condoning Linda's affair.

Linda didn't get home until late evening. By then Sam had consumed a couple more drinks and had finally given up on her and eaten a sandwich and chips. Sam's cooking repertoire didn't encompass much more in the way of edible menu items so he had decided to make cooking and cooking well another goal.

When it got to nine o'clock and Linda had not made an appearance or even made a phone call Sam went for a long walk around the neighborhood. There was a middle school track just a few blocks away and so he headed there at a pace that would preclude speaking.

He was out of breath on arrival at the school but only rested a short time before seeing how far and how long he could walk this fine evening.

Of course, like many out of shape people, he had wanted to walk for miles and hours but after forty minutes his legs ached and he was dizzy. He stopped and sat on the bleachers for a while before making his way home. He decided he would check on a personal trainer come Monday morning. He didn't want to get hurt and delay his progress.

He had deliberately worked hard enough so that he didn't think about his discovery that afternoon. It wasn't until he arrived home with shaky achy legs that he again considered his family problem. Hey, could that be a country song, "shaky, achy legs"? He was chuckling as he came into the living room. His humorous outlook took a header when he saw Linda and Charlie sitting close together on the couch.
