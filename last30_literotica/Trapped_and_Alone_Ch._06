Rosemary was sitting at her desk when she heard her computer ding indicating a new email. She opened Outlook and saw it was from a friend from another agency. She knew they concentrated on the Middle East and wondered why she was sending her a message. Rosemary opened the mail and read it over. At first she was confused as to why she was copied when she opened the attachment. The picture opened and Rosemary gasped, a sick feeling rushed up from her stomach.

Rosemary sat there for a moment before she closed the mail and picked up the phone. At first she started to call her team when a thought occurred to her. How did this happen. All her intelligence told her was that their mission was proceeding as planned. The picture was proof that all her data was incorrect. She hung up the phone, grabbed her purse, and walked out the door.

It took almost an hour before Rosemary arrive at her destination. After a few pleasantries Rosemary explained why she was there.

Standing beside her were Amanda Martin and Marcus Miller. They were from another agency that specialized in black ops. After receiving the email earlier she didn't trust anyone in her own agency.

"Thank you for meeting me on such short notice. I know this is unusual but I need your assistance. I received this picture this morning and it involves an undercover agent we have at a Drug Kingpin's island. Up to this morning I was under the understanding that the op was going well." Rosemary clicked the remote and a monitor came to life.



"Another agency sent me this picture and as you can see there are three women being led into a slave training camp near Yemen. I guess we knew it existed, but if you look closely the woman in the front is our undercover agent, and she's supposed to be on the other side of the world. All my reports from the other agent onsite say everything is going to plan. However, he either has no idea or he has been compromised and is either working with our target or being forced to give us false reports." Rosemary paused and watched for any reaction. Seeing none she continued.

"Now, we are not going to abandon our agent and I want you and your team to rescue her. The problem is we can't just storm the compound as there is another operation following this sect. We need to find a way to get her out of there without compromising the other operation."

Amanda stood there looking at the picture. She thought back on some of her other operations and knew she'd been lucky that she hadn't been compromised before. The thought of what the agent was going through made her entire being flush with anger.

"We'll get her out of there, send us everything you have and we will get back with you soon."

"Please do, and quickly. Our intelligence tells us that the women are only kept there for a few weeks before they are sold and never seen again. This picture is almost a week old. We have very little time and the longer she's there, even if we get her out, she may never be the same again."

The two agents nodded and the meeting ended.

For the next several hours, Rosemary was busy following up on some details that came to her after seeing the picture. Not wanting her team, or any team in her agency for that matter, she decided to do her own research. If there was a leak she would find it. When she got the call early that evening, she rushed to where Amanda instructed.

It was almost nine o'clock when everyone arrived at the designated meeting. Rosemary was the last to arrive. Already there were Amanda, Marcus, and another man sitting off to the side.

"Rosemary, I'd like to introduce my partner, Adam. He will be assisting with this OP. We think we may have found a way into the compound, but it's dangerous and we can't do it alone. Can you put together a team of field agents you can trust? Maybe 4 or 5?"

Rosemary nodded to Adam and listened to Amanda, "Yes, I can do that. I have some on assignment elsewhere that I can pull in."

"Good, if everything goes to plan we won't need them, but if things go wrong we'll need backup."

Amanda nodded and asked, "How are you going to get in without getting noticed?"

Amanda smiled and said, "Oh they'll notice us or I should say they'll notice me, I hope."

Rosemary looked at her friend, her face showing the confusion going through her head. But Amanda's coy look calmed her a bit.

"What do you mean you want to be noticed?"

"Well, Adam has a contact that works in, well, let's say he supplies a fair amount of arms to just about anyone and everyone over there. Adam put a little pressure on him and it just so happens he's going there in the next couple of days, and has agreed to take us with him." Amanda explained.

"Amanda, I'm not stupid. No one does things for free. What is this going to cost." Rosemary asked.

"Well, I guess.... I mean... Well Adam gave me to him. He knows we want in, but he thinks it's because Adam is scoping out the operation for a client that wants to send women there for training. But he wants Adam to see it in operation and as a token of his client's appreciation he's giving him me as a slave." Amanda seemed a little nervous now. She looked at Adam still sitting in the corner. He had been her partner for the last two months and they were still getting to know each other.

Amanda actually knew very little about Adam. She knew he was an ex-seal and had been undercover for the last year or so. But sometimes the looks he gave her made her think.

Rosemary looked at the two agents and studied their expressions. She trusted Amana explicitly, but didn't know Adam at all and something told her neither did Amanda. However it seemed like Amanda was willing, and she knew Amanda wouldn't take unnecessary risks.

"Okay, but what happens when you get in?" Rosemary inquired; she needed more details before she would sign off on the operation. The last thing she needed was to lose three agents in one operation.

Amanda nodded and pulled out a three folders with several sheets of paper, photos, and diagrams. Soon all four were going of them were going over the details. Amanda asked several question and finally after almost three hours she sat back.

"I'm not sure about this. I think the plan is solid getting in, but after you're in there's not much detail. Maybe we should look for other options?" Rosemary stated.

"Rosemary, we can't wait, each hour we delay the harder it will be to get her back. Now Adam has assured me that we can trust his contact to get us in. I understand we're working out some details after we get there, but we may not have another chance for days or even weeks to get in again. We need to move now. I know if that were me in there, knowing someone was coming would be the only thing that would keep me alive. I think we should do it." Amanda explained looking directly into Rosemary's eyes.

Rosemary sat and stared at the two of them for almost two minutes before she said, "Okay, do it."

Amanda shook Rosemary's hand and smiled, "We got this, and we'll get your girl out of there, trust us."

Rosemary looked at them and quietly said, "I hope so, I'd hate to lose all of you."

They all shook hands and walked out of the small room. Each going a different way as arrangements needed to be confirmed. Fifteen hours later, Amanda and Adam landed in a small aircraft somewhere in the Middle East. Amanda was already dressed as a slave and Adam's whole demeanor seemed to change. Amanda noticed the change and thought he was just getting into character, but his looks were taking on a noticeable leer.

They rushed out of the small plane and climbed into a large car with darkened windows. Once inside they couldn't see out. The window was closed between the driver and the passengers, but they assumed the car was bugged. Amanda was trying not to show it but her stomach was doing flip flops the further they went from the plane. She was practically naked, wearing a white lace nighty that covered little and highlighted her magnificent body. The White thong and high heel sandals finished off her outfit. Unfortunately, there was no place to hide anything. No cameras, microphones, or more importantly weapons. She was entirely dependent on Adam having her back. This initial meeting it was crucial that their arms dealer think she was a slave to be given to him. If she didn't act like a slave and do exactly as ordered the OP would be over before it started. Amanda's mind worked to get into character bowing her head and not speaking.

The ride took almost an hour and when the car stopped and the driver got out. In seconds the door opened and Adam climbed out, when Amanda started to follow the driver held his hand up and stopped her. Amanda sat back down and the door closed followed by a click as it locked. Amanda could only wait until she was summoned.

The car motor was off and so was the air conditioning. Seeing as this was the desert it was soon oppressive inside the black car. Amanda was now sweating profusely but she could only wait. She had no idea of how long she sat there, but when the door opened she almost fell on her face getting out of the oppressive sweat box inside the car. She looked up from her knees at the driver laughing at her.

"Get up slave, it's time to meet your new master." He grabbed the hair on the back of her head and pulled her to her feet. Amanda didn't struggle and allowed the driver to direct her to what appeared to be a tent about thirty yards in the distance. When they got there, the driver pulled a flap back and shoved her in.

Amanda blinked as her eyes adjusted to the light. The tent turned out to be a three sided shelter from the sun. There was floor, couch, rug, and table. Almost like a portable oasis. Standing in front of her was Adam. He was in the middle of the tent. Sitting by the couch behind him was a young man of mixed descent. He wasn't white, or Middle Eastern. He could probably blend in anywhere. Amanda stole glances in his direction and wasn't impressed. He was skinny with very little muscle definition. By what she could see behind the headdress she wasn't impressed with his looks either. She shivered at the thought of having sex with him, but she held no illusions about it not happening.

Amanda approached Adam and stood in front of her master. Adam pointed his finger up; using a prearranged signal meaning Amanda would put her hands on her head. He twirled his finger and Amanda spun around slowly, making sure her master got a good look, but never looking him in the eyes. When she was facing Adam again, she glanced briefly at his face, hoping for clues on her performance. But the look in his eyes made her look twice. It was a cross between lust and perversion. Amanda actually shivered at his look. She suddenly felt very alone.



Amanda stood staring at the floor when a voice behind her said, "Strip slave, but leave the shoes on and turn around I want to inspect my gift."

Amanda slid the nighty off her shoulders and down her body. She made sure to keep her legs straight when she bent over to pick it up, giving her master a good look at her ass. Staying in that position, Amanda slid her hands up, grasped the thin strip of elastic holding the tiny thong together. She slowly pulled it down her legs exposing her charms to the lowlife that now controlled her. Amanda was somewhat surprised at how her body was reacting. Her pussy was juicing and her nipples were hard. Without realizing it she was starting to pant.

Adam moved over to sit by his contact as Amanda turned to face them keeping her hands behind her head.



Amanda felt dirty as both men were gawking at her fabulous tits. She couldn't help but notice Adam was as into it as her master. Both men reached out and groped the naked agent. Despite how much she hated what was happening to her, her body loved every second. It took about ten minutes before Amanda was moaning and pushing her soaked pussy against their fingers. Her eyes closed and her mouth open as she gasped for air.

For the next half hour or so the two men kept teasing Amanda taking her to the edge a few times until Amanda's body was losing control as her muscles convulsed and her mouth grunting with each stroke of their fingers buried deep inside her core.

Amanda almost screamed when they stopped and pulled their hands away from her body. She needed some relief. She had figured that her master would fuck her and keep her close. But as her senses came back she noticed another man was behind her. Before she could react, he grabbed her hands and cuffed them behind her back. Amanda was caught off guard and now was naked, cuffed, and being lead out of the tent.

Knowing she couldn't struggle her thoughts were of her partner. Was she sure he had her back? A sudden burst of laughter behind her put more than a little bit of doubt in her mind.



Adam tried not to show any attachment with Amanda. He had to be convincing that she was nothing to him but a gift to Andre. Adam had used Andre a couple of times before. Each time it usually worked out okay. But this was by far the most dangerous OP he had used Andre. He knew Amanda was having trouble handling the teasing, but he had no choice. He didn't react except to laugh at one of Andre's sick jokes as Amanda was being led away. Andre explained that she was just being taken to another tent to be dressed and would be brought to them later to have some fun.

What Adam didn't know was Andre had other plans for his new slave. He knew Adam was a spook, but as long as he didn't interfere with his business it didn't matter. Besides he might be able to use him later if he got in trouble.

Andre suspected that the woman was an agent too and wanted to humiliate her and break her spirit if things worked out. He suspected that if Adam knew what was happening he would stop it, so using the excuse to have her dress, he sent the slave to be marked as a possession for the rest of her life. He also had another surprise in store for her. If she was an agent too, he figured that at some time she would escape and wanted to find her when she did. He smiled at Adam and offered another drink.

Amanda was pulled over to a black pickup and driven a short distance away. She was more than a little nervous and it increased the further she was from Adam. Amanda was relieved when the truck stopped, still in sight of the tent but almost a mile away. Amanda looked around and there were a few men loitering around, but they perked up when the naked agent was pulled into their midst.

Amanda at first thought she was going to be gang raped when her arms and ankles were chained to stakes in the ground. A bit gag filled her mouth and a metal collar was locked around her neck. Attached to the collar was another short chain that went to another stake. She was strung up so tight she couldn't move but only look directly in front of her. Amanda thought this would be when she was going to be fucked, but instead the men pulled up a metal fire ring and started a fire.

Amanda was already sweating in the desert heat and starting a fire didn't cause any alarms to ring. They all watched the fire as it steadily got hotter and hotter. Amanda was feeling the heat when her Master and Adam drove up. She felt a bit of relief when she saw Adam, but that was short lived. The man tending the fire had inserted two long metal probes into the fire. He kept stirring the fire as Amanda looked on.

It was when he pulled out the probe that Amanda realized what it was: a branding iron, and it was starting to turn red hot.



Amanda started to struggle against her bindings, but they must have done this before because she really couldn't move at all. She knew her fate was sealed.

The helpless agent could only watch as the man pulled out the iron, now cherry red and step closer to her body. She closed her eyes when first she heard the sizzling and then felt the intense pain on the right shoulder. Amanda screamed into her bit gag but it could barely be heard. It felt like he kept the searing probe on her body for minutes, but it was probably on a second or two, when Amanda passed out.



When she woke she had a little trouble comprehending where she was and how she got there. She was still naked, but she was in a cage. Her head stuck out the top and her arms were out the sides and attached to the sides beside her head. She was on her knees and her ankles seemed to be attached to the back of the cage. Her mouth was filled with a rubber gag of some sort that filled her mouth completely. She tried but couldn't utter a sound.

As Amanda's senses cleared she noticed her shoulder was still hurting, but surprisingly not as much as she would have expected. Otherwise she felt okay, but her left shoulder also hurt, not much but it felt like something wasn't the same. Amanda dismissed the thought and tried to assess her situation. She no longer felt she could count on her partner so she tried to watch to see if she could escape.



Amanda watched closely, but soon she was loaded on the back of a truck and driving down the road.

Adam and Andre went back to the shelter laughing as the truck went down the road. Adam knew that Amanda was in trouble, but he also knew that the truck was heading to the compound. The OP hadn't gone exactly to plan, but Amanda was in and soon he hoped he and Andre would be following.

Andre led Adam back to the tent and sat down. "So Adam, what's really going on here? Do you think I'm a fool? Why here and why now?" Andre said while staring in Adam's eyes. "Now, keep in mind the slave is gone and if you ever want to see her again you should think carefully about your answer."

Adam's mind was going a mile a minute. He needed to have a believable answer that could be checked out quickly. If he answered wrong, he and Amanda were as good as dead.

"Andre, you know me, we've worked together before. Why would I lie?" Adam said, trying to buy time.

Andre just smiled and waited for Adam to answer. He already knew that the slave was a plant and a spook. He knew that Adam was a spook but what he didn't know was what their real mission was, and he wasn't going to take a chance it was him. He could care less about the slave camp. He was only concerned about his sale of hand held missiles to a bunch of camel jockeys.
