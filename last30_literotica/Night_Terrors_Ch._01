 The screams pulled Caroline from her sleep. Her heart stomped and for a moment she didn’t dare to move. The screams were primal and filled with despair and pain. It didn’t matter how often she heard them, they always frighten her. With a tired murmur, she turned on her back and flung out her arm. The other side of the bed was empty, which was common after Ron had started his new job as a salesman a couple of months back. She sighed when she recalled that she would need to pick him up the airport tomorrow evening. If it hadn’t been for Jake’s 19th birthday, she doubted Ron would have bothered to come home over the weekend. The next scream where high pitched and came to an abrupt stop. Jake was awake.

Caroline held her breath and listened. Jake’s night terrors had started after his mother died. It had been gruesome, and Jake had been with her as she passed. When Caroline and Maddie moved in the episodes subsided and for a couple of years, they were uncommon. Caroline and Ron took it as a sign that Jake approved of their relationship.

The door opened and cautious steps moved over the carpet. The bed rebounded as Jake slipped under the covers on Ron’s side. His rapid breaths filled the bedroom. After Jake’s 18 birthday, the night terrors had come back fiercer than ever. Now he could experience them twice a week, instead of just once or twice a month. His therapist had explained that it was nothing to worry about, and he believed the episodes would subside over time. Caroline wasn’t that sure. For the past year, they had found Jake several times curled up on the small sofa by the bedroom window, or when Ron was away, in their bed. She suspected Jake needed sleeping pills or some other medications, but Ron refused to listen. Jake calmed down beside her and his light breaths had a soothing effect. Soon she closed her eyes and drifted away to sleep.

Caroline woke up to an unbearable heat as if it was a scorching summer night. Jake laid against her back, with one knee resting on her hip. His warm breath breezed over her neck. Just as she was about to push him away and pull the sheets off, she felt it. With a gentle thrust, Jake pushed his hips against her and then pulled back. Confused Caroline couldn’t wrap her tired mind around what he was doing. Then he pressed against her again and a hard bulge, the size of a fist, pushed against her buttocks. Then he withdrew again. First, she thought his hand had slipped down between them, but when it dawned on her what he was doing a cold sensation shoot through her body.

Caroline laid paralyzed and nibbled her lip as Jake continued to grind against her in a slow rhythm. His breath was warm and heavy. What was she supposed to do? Caroline knew that boys could have uncontrollable urges, which could drive them to do bizarre things. She had heard co-workers complaining about wet socks and hidden piles of Kleenex. But this was something else than a couple of innocent stains on a bed sheet wasn’t it, she thought, or was it sleep-induced? Maybe Jake wasn’t awake? Regardless, she needed to do something. Was it safe to wake him up or would it frighten him and make him panic? She decided that the safest action would be to ease towards the edge of the bed, but to her surprise, her body didn’t want to move.

The hard bulge slipped between her buttocks and flexed. A feeble sigh brushed against her neck. Caroline’s nipples grew hard and a warm familiar tingle kindled between her legs. In horror, she realized that in a deep and primal way her body enjoyed it, and she embraced the closeness and warmth from his body like a starved animal. Was it the taboo or the fact that Ron’s interest in her had faded the last year? Either way, it was wrong and a voice of reason inside her begged her to move away before it was too late, but she refused to listen. The pleasure from his movements was too strong. His breaths against her neck sent electric jolts down her flushed body and her cheeks became warm. She closed her eyes, moistened her lips, and tried not to moan.

Jake’s rhythm increased and his breath became jagged. Every time he pressed his bulge against her, she had to restrain herself so she wouldn’t press her ass against him. From his breaths and movements, she knew he was near release. Her hand grabbed the edge of the mattress to prevent her fingers to fondle her wet swollen lips and massage her quivering clit. Everything in the world vanished and all she could think of was the pleasure building up inside her.

With a sharp gasp, Jake shoved his bulge between her buttocks and his body stiffened up. Caroline held her breath as the bulge grew and begun to spasm while a suppressed groan hit her neck. In her mind, she pictured how hot thick sperm spurted out of his hard dick and filled his briefs. Her eyes rolled up in her head. It was like the orgasm danced under her skin and waited for a deep breath or a gentle touch to set it off.

When the bulge came to a stop, Jake laid still for a while before he rolled away. Caroline didn’t dare to move and took light shallow breaths. It was like she floated in a timeless existence of pleasure. The desire and wetness between her legs almost overwhelmed her and soon she wouldn’t care if Jake was awake or not, or if the entire world was watching - she needed to touch herself.

After an eternity Jake slipped out of the bed and tiptoed out of the room. As soon as he closed the door behind him Caroline turned over to her stomach. Before her hand had reached down into her panties, the orgasm began to roll over her like a snowball down a steep hill. With ease, two fingers slipped into her warm silken hole and her hips begun to pump up and down. The sexual bliss moved through her like electric shocks. Her toes curled up, her thighs flexed, and the veins pushed against her sweaty neck. The long and hard contractions in her vagina took her breath away and she squeaked into the pillow. She pushed her hips down against her fingers making them go deeper inside her wet pussy. Never had she experienced such a magnificent orgasm before, and she wished it would never end.

Caroline found herself with her face buried in the pillow gasping for air. Her fingers were still inside her wet canal while the climax faded. After her body had calmed down, she threw away the sheets and rolled on her back. The cool air embraced her warm sweaty body and with a dull smile she stretched out on the bed, while her exhausted mind bathed in delight. Just as she was about to drift away the anxiety hit her like a fist in the stomach.

A metallic taste grew in her mouth, and she thought she would throw up. She got up from the bed and wrung her hands together as she began to pace around the room. The wet panties against her thighs felt cold and dirty. The shame tightened around her chest and the tears weren’t far away. Then the catastrophic thoughts revolved around her head like a carousel. What was wrong with her? What was she thinking? What if someone would know how she had defiled herself and enjoyed it? What if Ron would found out what happened? It would ruin their family and Jake’s chances of a normal life. With a deep sigh, she sunk down on the sofa and damned herself that she hadn’t stopped it while she had the chance. She crossed her arms around her belly and rocked back and forth, while she fought off the tears. 

“Oh my God, what have I done?” She whispered into the darkness.
